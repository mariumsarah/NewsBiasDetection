When the trifecta of scandals first broke over the White House a few weeks ago, the media (who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the IRS and Benghazi) were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts. Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed. 
It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves, talk to the White House, and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach,” “McCarthyism,” “disarray,” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete, not coordinate, with one another. 
The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth, the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down, his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy, and the bleeding must be stopped. 
Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico. 
During Tuesday’s testimony, Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs. 
Democrats, however, did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted, and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.  
Well, that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups, none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.
But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign, to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.  
The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents. 
Well, right on cue, Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read. 
And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department. 
But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS. 
The Politico piece, however, intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government. 
The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS, that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and  threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media. 
Working directly with the Democrats, Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS. 
The actual crime is no longer the story, according to Politico. No, the story is that the victims had it coming.

The Department of Justice has summarily removed federal funding from two Louisiana youth programs because a local official refused to sign a pledge stating he would require the programs to ban mentions of God.
Julian Whittington, the sheriff of Bossier Parish, LA, told Fox News that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the Young Marines chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program, chartered in 1965, the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case, it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary, student-led prayer session as one of its activities.
Sheriff Whittington says that the DOJ withdrew a combined $30,000 from the programs because the groups refused to remove God from their activities. The sheriff said this was evidence of the government’s “aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms.”
Whittington told Fox, “We were informed that these are unacceptable, inherently religious activities and the Department of Justice would not be able to fund the programs if it continued. They wanted a letter from me stating that I would no longer have voluntary prayer and I would also have to remove ‘God’ from the Young Marine’s oath.”
The oath from the Young Marine organization reads:
From this day forward, I sincerely promise, I will set an example for all other youth to follow and I shall never do anything that would bring disgrace or dishonor upon God, my Country and its flag, my parents, myself or the Young Marines. These I will honor and respect in a manner that will reflect credit upon them and myself. Semper Fidelis
Both the U.S. Army enlistment oath and its commissioning oath end with “so help me God.”
As to the at-risk youth program, Whittington said,”We’re not promoting any specific religion, this is just voluntary prayer, mention of God, how offensive and bad can that be?”
In response to the DOJ’s message insisting that he sign the anti-God pledge, Sheriff Whittington sent a letter of his own to LA Governor Bobby Jindal.
“As a Christian, Sheriff and American citizen, I am writing to express my frustration and concern over the persistent aggression and infringement of our religious freedoms which have been imposed upon the law enforcement grant programs, specifically related to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement,” wrote the Sheriff.
In cutting off the funding, the DOJ claimed it was a violation of Church and State rules for the government to fund any group that mentions God.
Fox’s Todd Starnes says that, “Both youth programs have been hailed as a successful way to reach at-risk young people. Since 2002 more than 1,000 young people have graduated from the program, directed by a Bossier Parish deputy who is a former U.S. Marine.”
Like Sheriff Whittington, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) was troubled by the DOJ’s actions.
“There is a very wide effort coming out of the administration that seeks to stamp out freedom of expressions – particularly religion and especially freedom of Christian expression,” Fleming said. “They are willing to throw the youth overboard and remove the funding just in the name of making this an atheist, agnostic, secular organization.”
“They (DOJ) don’t want anything to have any sort of religious support – even down to prayer,” Fleming said. “It’s sad and it’s inconsistent with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.”
Sheriff Whittington is not taking this lying down. “When something is not right and you know it’s not right and you keep bowing down, nothing is ever going to change,” he said."

Most here saw the Tea Party assholes for what they were long ago.  Well, they showed up without their Klan hoods to show themselves to the world at President Obama's speech in Arizona:
Obama foes at one point sang, ""Bye Bye Black Sheep,"" a derogatory reference to the president's skin color, while protesters like Deanne Bartram raised a sign saying, ""Impeach the Half-White Muslim!""
Many on both sides wore red, white and blue and carried small flags.

“He needs to go back to where he came from because obviously, he is a liar,” she said. “I am not racist. I am part Indian. Obama’s half Black, half White.”
“He’s 47 percent Negro,” shouted Ron Enderle, a 77-year-old Chandler resident who said that he and his son served as Marines and his grandson is currently serving in the Marines.

“We have gone back so many years,” she said. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”

3/5 of a person. That should be familiar.  It is how slaves were counted for purposes of representation (and taxation) in the U. S. House in the original Constitution:
Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.
And as one could read about the proposal in Virginia to change how the state awards its electoral votes, in A Message To The Virginia GOP From A Plantation<?a>, a blog post by Paul Bibeau earlier this week,  
This plan counts the votes of Obama supporters, or Democrats, or ""urban people"" - Have I used the right code words here? Do we know who we're talking about? - less than other Virginians.
But you need to do the actual math. No one on your side - at least I hope no one on your side - has crunched the numbers. Last election, Barack Obama won 51.16% of the vote. Under the new bill he would have won four of the states 13 electoral votes.
And do you know how much it counts an Obama voter as? (It's 4/13 divided by 51.16%. I'll wait. Do it. Get a calculator. You'll crap yourself.)
IT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THREE FIFTHS.
This bill counts an Obama voter as 3/5 of a person. I don't know if that fraction rings a bell with you. It was kind of a big deal, way back when. Women in fancy dresses, guys in gray - a lot of gray was in style. Is the light coming on now?

H/T to Charles M. Blow, who references the Bilbeau post in his NY Times column today, titled Rig the Vote, which is worth reading  ....
and please continue below the fold for just a few words more.


Blow's final two paragraphs, which come immediately after referencing Bibeau, read as follows:
That is because, as Talking Points Memo says, “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.”
This is not where we should be in 2013, debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”

The bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it, so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate;  the  Lt. Gov opposes it, and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it, so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.
It is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split, and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals, rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total, the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts, not the majority of the state's votes.  Those districts were heavily gerrymandered, because in 2008 the Dems had won 6 of the state's electoral votes, and even though Glenn Nye and Tom Perriello and Rick Boucher were defeated in 2010, the Republicans were taking no chances and redrew the CDs to make them more Republican friendly.  Obama actually won one CD represented by a Republican.
The proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist - he wants rural (for which you can read ""white"") voters not to be outvoted by urban (for which you can read ""black"" and to a lesser degree ""Hispanic"") voters.
It will not go anywhere.
It is ironic that the vote distribution turned out to so closely match the ratio of the 3/5 Compromise.
But then, part of the pushback against Obama has from the beginning been because he was Black.
Odd that the ratio would now increasingly include young people and women as well as people of color.
Again, it won't happen in Virginia.
It seems like the parallel in Florida is also dead, because the Republican heads of the two chambers of the state legislature are opposed to splitting the electoral vote.
But let's be clear -  the intent of such proposal is not merely to steal states for Republicans that they might not otherwise win, it is to diminish the value of the votes of minorities and expand the power of angry old white men.
Like the attempts this past cycle at voter suppression through voter-id laws and limiting access to early voting, this will produce a backlash.
Perhaps those pushing such proposals really do want to make Obama voters count for only 3/5.
In the process what they might be demonstrating is that they themselves have only 3/5 the intelligence and moral character of those whose votes they seek to diminish.

Good luck with that, Texas



Good luck with that, Texas

Oh, Texas.  What to do with you.
So mere hours after the Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Texas wasted no more time and re-instituted the same redistricting plan the courts had already ruled as unconstitutional.  The same with their new voter suppression bill.
Attorney General Holder was having none of it, however.  Texas was the first lawsuit to be filed by the Justice Department under Section 2 of the Voting Right Act.  
And now Texas is presenting its defense. It is using two main arguments.
And boy, are they doozies.
Jump below the Chee-to for more:


First, says Attorney General Greg Abbott, the redistricting is not about race.  Oh no.  It's about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote.  White Democrats too.
From their brief:
DOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011, both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities, and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations, and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions, even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.
Translation:
""So, basically, we just want to fuck over all Democrats, and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt, well, they shouldn't vote for Democrats, should they?  It's only collateral damage""
You know, having them actually come right out and say it--that they don't want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising.  But it's good that they're doing it at last.  
But wait!  There's more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination, Texas is using the argument that ""Yeah, there may be an isolated incident or two, but it's NOTHING like it was in 1965"".  
From the article, which says it better than I can:
Furthermore, the state claims, even if Texas did discriminate, and the state stresses that it did not, it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses, what’s the big whoop?
So, according to this, Texas is arguing that Section 2, and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965.  And that since ""things are better than in 1965"" then Section 2 is null and void.
I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.  
However, there is a danger here.  Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process.  Sort of like an ""originalism to the extreme"" argument.  
And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.  
Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments, but that's another story.

So I am overjoyed about what happened in Texas, not the least because it was so unexpected, and so....freaking great. I loved every minute of it, and can't tell you how happy I am to have a new Democratic hero in Wendy Davis.
I want to make this very clear, so people will understand what is in my heart as I write this diary. I watched the breathless news tonight on MSNBC, and I saw Kos's effort to draft MS. Davis to run for governor, and I'm all over it all.
But there was a part of me that felt SO sad too. I remember when Wisconsin's capitol was filled w/that kind of crowd for WEEKS ON END. I remember when Democrats and progressives in Wisconsin filled not only the rotunda of their capitol, but all the real estate they could in every direction OUTSIDE the capitol, for WEEKS ON END.
And most here at the DK, supported the effort, and it was thrilling. Then came the recall, and we lost. I could say why I think this happened, but it doesn't matter. It just did. And since then, despite all those thrilling hopeful days, things have only gotten worse in Wisconsin.
And one of the biggest ways that has happened, is the Wisconsin republican answer to seeing THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN, as long as they're in power. They have made endless laws to make sure of that. And now, what happened in Texas last night, will be very difficult for Wisconsin to match. It's crazy. Possible in Texas, almost impossible in Wisconsin.
Those of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house, and who can be there, and under what conditions, know how fast after the loss of the recall the GOP clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti Walker uprising would happen again on their watch. I could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are. I could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the Wisconsin GOP has put on anything like what happened in Texas yesterday, and what happened in Wisconsin, week after week, at one time not so long ago.
Recently, the Republican Wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in Texas. The ""gallery"" was highly restricted. Women w/tape over their mouths---to signify protest to the new rules of their being there---were told to remove the tape or be arrested. They removed the tape and covered their mouths w/their hands. Some Democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard.
But in the end, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up, they would NOT be heard. This disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video, and God bless her, on Rachel Maddow's show. Other than that, crickets. The nation has left the story of Wisconsin behind. We tried, we lost, and journalism is not about losers.
I CHEER what happened in Texas yesterday with all my heart. BUT, beware of the media story on your side today. Because it can be gone tomorrow. And don't underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged. I'll bet you the little money I have in the bank, that Texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again. The only reason they aren't there now in Texas, is because what happened surprised the hell out of them. Don't doubt for a minute that they're gathered in back rooms as I write this, figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again.
I cheer every minute of attention Texas gets w/this, and I cheer Wendy Davis. I don't want it to go away. But I know it will. My message here is not about cynicism, or about ""don't bother."" IT. IS. NOT.
My message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country, and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this. And that means in Wisconsin too, no matter how gerrymandered it is. I frankly don't know how to do this. But I do know the answer is NOT to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger. And I don't for a minute suggest that's what Wisconsin Democrats are doing. BUT, everything is so much harder for them now.
Wisconsin must find a way to rise again, and Texas must find a way to hold on to this win. And part of that is seeing what's coming. And I'm telling you what's coming in Texas. Somehow, some way, we must stop this. And that means we have to decide our priorities as Democrats. And there in lies the rub. And I have no answer for it.

From Lone Star Project:
Earlier today (Wednesday), the three-judge Federal District Court in San Antonio handling the Texas redistricting litigation entered a final judgment in the Texas State Senate redistricting law suit.  In its ruling, the Court made clear that Wendy Davis and her fellow plaintiffs in the case won and Greg Abbott, representing the Republican state leadership, lost.
...
Greg Abbott served as the primary legal counsel to the State of Texas during the consideration of redistricting by the Legislature and defended the State’s redistricting plans in federal court. His efforts in redistricting have been nothing short of an embarrassing debacle.
Abbott advised the Legislature to configure and adopt redistricting plans that the federal courts ruled to be in violation of the US Voting Rights Act. Two of the three redistricting plans were ruled to be drawn with discriminatory intent. Abbott has spent millions of dollars in Texas taxpayer funds to unsuccessfully defend redistricting plans that were unfair and illegal. Abbott’s actions go beyond partisanship to illustrate profound incompetence and open hostility to Hispanics, African Americans and other fair-minded Texans.

It sounds like Goposaur Abbott was trying to implement the discriminatory redistricting plan DESPITE it's already having been ruled illegal. That should be a crime in and of itself. Disgusting.
Sen. Davis, who heroically filibustered Texas' draconian abortion bill back in June, is looking more and more like a viable candidate for Texas governor. If I lived there, she would have my vote.

A proposed non-discrimination ordinance in San Antonio barring discrimination against LGBT people has been a source of considerable controversy as of late. Right-wing individuals and groups have predictably smeared the proposal and tried to whip up fear and make it out to be ""anti-religion."" And now, the plot thickens, as Republican Councilwoman Elisa Chan has been outed by a former staffer as an outright homophobe.
James Stevens, who served as an aide to Chan, has resigned this week, but he's going out with a bang. Unbeknownst to Chan and the other staffers, he had recorded a private meeting from May 21 about the ordinance on his iPhone. What the recording reveals, other than the fact that Chan is an idiot and had some idiots working for her, is a rather appalling anti-gay conversation between Chan and her staffers. During the course of the conversation, one of her staffers brings up incest and bestiality and Chan herself calls homosexuality disgusting and says that gay people should not be allowed to adopt. Some pretty extreme homophobia on display.


I'm going to embed the 15-minute recording below, which you should listen to if you have the stomach. But here are some of Chan's ""gems"" extracted by the San Antonio Express-News:
By the way, this is politically incorrect. I don’t think homosexual people should do adoption. They should be banned by adoption. You’re going to confuse those kids. They should be banned.
If you wanted to choose that lifestyle, we don’t want to discriminate you, but you shouldn’t affect the young people. How terrible. … They’re going to be confused. You see two men go into a bedroom. You see two women kissing. Is that not confusing? It’s confusing.
It is actually, what you call, suggestive, for the kids to be corrupt, which is against nature. I’m telling you, anything that is against nature is not right.
You know, to be quite honest, I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born, that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.
When I say that it’s … behavioral preference, they say that, ""No, you’re born with it."" But I never bought into that.
I think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.
Perhaps even more interesting is how far she's willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.
In strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance, Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper.
“Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good, those arguments we talk as a speaking point, in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level.
“This is another layer of bureaucracy, that we have not heard any discrimination,” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries, that we have a trend, that is, maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.”
“Maybe what we can do, can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like, OK, this ‘transgender,’ because the definition is so broad…”

Listen to the horrifying recording yourself:









Chan's then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we're on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original, right?) and tells Chan to be a ""culture warrior"" on the issue. Well, he's now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg, who was just elected to the City Council, as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:
I was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments, which were intended to be purely political, do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg, whom I currently serve and support, has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable, and I am proud to work for him.
Right.
As for Chan, she acted as if she didn't know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:
I think that's in a private setting and I don't know if that's — I need to hear that recording to know. I'm not quite sure what you're talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings, so I wanted to know also under what context.
There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn't confirm or deny. Right. We'll see how that goes for her.

Accomplishment: When your father Dick Cheney has to go on record saying you're a bigger jerk than he is.

Looks like there's trouble in the Cheney clan. Liz Cheney is running for something, and in the Republican party running for something means you're against gay marriage, even though her own sister is gay. Her father Dick is not running for anything anymore, which means he has been freed to have a non-scummy opinion on the subject—and really, when noted torture-of-prisoners advocate Dick Cheney is not a gigantic asshole about something, it stands out. So now we get to watch the spectacle of Dick and Lynne Cheney releasing a public statement distancing themselves from their campaigning daughter.
This is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public. Since it has, one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position.
I like how they preemptively defend Liz from the notion that she's just pretending to be an intolerant ass on the subject. Oh no, dear Republicans, we assure you Liz has always been an intolerant ass about this. For years! She just swallows her bile in front of her sister, most of the time, because family and whatnot.
Put this up as another reason you probably never want to eat dinner with the Cheney family on Thanksgiving. That is probably going to be one, er, interesting evening. (And I hope they're not going to be cooking anyone we know.)

Bigots.



Bigots.

This is a common refrain in right-wing circles these days:
Scanning national media over the last several days, one sees words such as homophobia, bigotry and xenophobia thrown like confetti by liberals at anyone who dare say that under the federal constitution, states have the right to define marriage. These scare tactics are actually working—Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, felt compelled to appear on national TV and explain that Catholic religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman forever, to create life is not bigotry but a religious teaching. The left's response—not enough. Nothing is enough short of changing religious doctrine to fit the beliefs of the liberal masses.
This is driving the wingers to distraction. Theirs is an entire movement built on the politics of resentment, from the racist Southern Strategy to anti-gay ballot initiatives. Now those roosters are coming home to roost, and the damage inflicted is incalculable.
We liberals always knew modern conservatism was (literally) built on racial resentment, from the day the Republican Party accepted the Dixiecrats with open arms. But that brand is seeping into the broader mainstream. I keep going back to this GOP focus group in Ohio after the 2012 election, where young working-class white voters expressed dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the Democrats, but were just vicious in their assessment of the GOP:
None of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama. But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the women’s had been. “Racist,” “out of touch” and “hateful” made the list — “and put ‘1950s’ on there too!” one called out.
Remember, those aren't liberals, but the kind of white working-class swing-state voters Republicans need to attract to offset their growing disadvantages with non-Anglo voters. But few want to vote for a racist, hateful, out-of-touch party straight out of the 1950s.
That's why you'll now see the bigots spend half their time arguing that they're not bigots and don't really hate gay people, it's just that they can't tolerate something consenting adults are doing so fuck them and their rights. See? It's not bigotry. It's just intolerance, which is totally different than bigotry!
The mask is off the modern GOP, and all the whining and revisionism can't change the fact that America sees them for the hateful paranoid bigoted xenophobes that they are. And if that hurts their chances at winning elections? It just means that sometimes, there really is justice in this world.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, seen here lecturing others about their 'values'

Given the caliber of political mind Texas Republicans seem intent on foisting off onto the rest of us, non-Texans might be curious as to what sorts of people they've tapped for state government of late. The simple answer is ""more of the same,"" as the responses to an AP questionnaire on gay rights sent to GOP candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general revealed. Lt. Gov. Dewhurst sets the tone:
""Sadly, in a culture infected with political correctness, people of faith are targeted for defending their beliefs with no consideration of their First Amendment rights. I will continue to stand with my fellow Texans in defending our God-given, constitutionally protected freedoms.""
Yes, yes. Why are we even talking about civil rights for gay Americans when people of faith are the real victims here. It's getting so you can't even show your love for Jesus by calling someone names and beating them up anymore.
GOP gubbernatorial candidate Tom Pauken:
""Current statutes adequately address the issue of equality before the law and I would oppose laws that provide preferential treatments based on lifestyle choices.""
Unless that lifestyle choice is my own, in which case all the rules will be written to support that and only that.
Attorney general candidate Ken Paxton:
""I do not believe in elevating sexual 'rights' to be superior to religious freedom and freedom of conscience. Such rights are enumerated nowhere in the Texas or U.S. Constitution, unlike religious freedom ...
Again, the victimhood is palpable. You having your rights will automatically infringe on my right to believe you shouldn't have that, so you shouldn't have that. Each candidate seems to have set out to make the laziest, dullest argument possible as point of personal conservative pride.
We shall see if Texas demographics begin to reverse the tide of celebrated Republican dullardism that has turned state politicians into national laughingstocks. Republicans are highly devoted to making sure that doesn't happen, but I remain confident that at some point the party will elect someone to office who is so stone-cold stupid, such an obvious empty sack, such an impressive specimen of termite-riddled fencepost that the entire state shudders in embarrassment and begins to rethink their party lifestyle choice en masse. It would have to be someone meaner than Steve Stockman and dumber than Louie Gohmert and—well, I forget the third thing—but do not worry about that. Somewhere in Texas there is a very drunk and bitter man sleeping it off under a church pew who fits all those requirements and then some. Get to it, Republicans. Find that final mean, stupid, godbothering anti-science crank who can out-crook and under-whelm all the rest of them. It is your destiny.

I would trade quite a lot, in my life, for the unfathomable beauty of having national legislators who are not as dumb as burlap sacks of asbestos. Alas, however, it doesn't look like I'll ever see such a thing no matter what I were to wager, so let's check in on one of the nation's preeminent current sacks and see what they're up to.
In this case, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-TheMatterWithKansas) is the sack, and he's tossing himself in the muddy river of the Washington Times because, presumably, it was the dumbest outlet he could find, with an anti-marriage-equality argument that only counts as an ""argument"" if you like your arguments dull, jingoistic, ankle-shallow, devoid of facts, devoid of logic and generally devoid of anything that would ever suggest the writer was a sentient, breathing thing. As we've seen at the Supreme Court, however, that's all the ""argument"" we're going to get. The same arguments about God Says So, the same assertion that marriage is reserved for ""procreation only"" in spite of that never, ever seeming to come up when any of the other non-procreating people sign their names on the courthouse forms, and the same general sense that it is the bigots and the god-botherers and the people who feel icky when thinking about other people living their damn lives in peace that are the true victims in all this, because how can America survive if the biggest assholes among us do not hold holy sway over the rest?
All right, let's do this thing, or at least pieces of it. First off, the premise of the sack's argument is that ""motherhood"" is under attack. If there's any substantive argument to say so, hell if I can parse it out, but so sayeth the sack. That, and then some:
For conservatives, the concept of family is the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained, a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit recognized by the laws of nature, the laws of government, and civilized societies for thousands of years: one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption. In my case, that means me, Angela (my wife of 18 years), and our four children (who happen to be adopted).
Oh, dear God, it's going to be one of these. For the record, there is not a damn bit of that that is not puerile fluff. Let's break it up, below the fold:



For conservatives, the concept of family is (1) the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained, (2) a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit (3) recognized by the laws of nature, the (4) laws of government, and (5) civilized societies for thousands of years: (6) one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption.
(1) Says you. (2) Except the ""multiple wives"" ones. (3) There is no ""marriage"" at all in the ""laws of nature"", and you have no earthly clue what the ""laws of nature"" even might be, and ""family"" in nature is the result of anything from pair bonding to harems to gang rape to ritual murder to situational hermaphroditism to the male of the species biting the female upon which his body is slowly dissolved and absorbed into the female until only only the testicles are left, so shut up about what the supposed laws of nature say we should be doing to get ourselves in a family way and (4) see (2), and (5) see (2) and (4) and a whole mess of civilized societies who thought having a young boy on the side was the purest form of love there could be and (6) I'm just going to point out, yet a-freaking-gain, that the whole concept of ""marriage"" has been for nearly all of human history a question of property rights, and the spouse counted as a useful but not necessarily decisive portion of the property. I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered, pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph, and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenry at the damn least gets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.
If that happens, the high priests and priestesses of political correctness will have done irreparable harm to yet another pillar of the American paradigm for our patriotic, wholesome culture — “God, the flag, mom and apple pie.”
God damn it, here we have a person honestly using ""God, the flag, mom and apple pie"" as the pillars of ""the American paradigm,"" and they're not doing it ironically, neither the ""apple pie"" or the ""paradigm"" part. No, Tim here means it literally, and goes on to say that Bloomberg's soda ban and Michelle Obama's gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation's kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn't an April Fool's prank, this is a April Fool's way of life, preached about by an April Fool's mind, taken as a holy god damn April Fool's sacrament.
The Obama administration makes the incredible assertion that motherhood is superfluous to rebut an argument that the traditional two-parent family, led by both a mother and a father, provides the ideal situation to raise a child. In defiance of biology, nature and common sense, the administration argues that children need neither a father nor a mother and that having two fathers or two mothers or more is just as good as having one of each.
You are an idiot, and nobody's arguing anything about that, and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we're just going to explore this for one second, before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage, those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who, if we deny same-sex marriage, will say, ""Oh, rats, well, I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender, which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing."" No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man, one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.
Government, both federal and state, has a legitimate and defensible interest in ensuring that children conceived by a mother and father are, in fact, raised by their biological mothers and fathers whenever possible.
You, Tim Huelskamp, are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers, and yet you say yourself that you've adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role, and I can only assume it's because you, you bastard, adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.
I don't even want to go through all of Huelskamp's drivel; it's all just a collection of other people's most vapid thoughts, dumbed down, beaten up, then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument, such as it is, is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic, and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He's not even talking about ""gay Americans should not adopt children"", which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around, he's saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to ""motherhood"" and ""God"" and, sweet Jeebus, ""apple pie.""
This. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest, it is not thoughtful, it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted, dull-minded twerps who know they don't like same sex marriages being recognized, but can't rustle up so much as even the slightest actual, substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is, nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can't get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don't have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases, full stop, which itself is an implausible argument, you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father, or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version, and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments, this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don't have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.
This is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have, at long last, moved on, leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy, droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing, mustered for an argument that doesn't even make any internal sense, mustered because the only people left on the loser's side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense, and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks. I will be very, very glad when these people evolve that sense of shame. Anytime now, please.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, suddenly an expert on the Constitution, said on Wednesday that she and Barack Obama are “honoring the Constitution” in their attacks on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Pelosi pontificated:
And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution. When you pass a bill in the House, as we did with the health care bill, we made it iron clad constitutionally. You have a responsibility to honor the Constitution. In fact, we take an oath to do just that, and that is the oath that President Obama is upholding.
Attacking the GOP’s support for the Defense of Marriage Act, Pelosi whined:
We weigh equities. Congress passes a bill. It’s questionable in terms of constitutionality. There’s no question about your oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the behavior of the Republicans in the House of Representatives on this subject has been so irresponsible. First of all, why in this time would you pass a bill that increases discrimination? We’re going in the direction of the arc of Justice [Henry L.] Benning in favor of more justice, not more discrimination. Why would you do such a thing in the first place? And then when it is questioned in terms of its constitutionality to spend money in the tune of millions outside the regular order of how that money should be spent to defend increasing discrimination in our society, it’s just plain wrong. And given a choice I think we would all say we’re honoring, as the president does, the Constitution.
Pelosi boasted of her home city’s influence in the assault on traditional values, claiming that same-sex marriage is “inevitable.” She continued:
From our beautiful place in San Francisco, the city of St. Francis, we knew that it was inevitable that all of this would happen. It was inconceivable to others that it would, and it was our job to use whatever influence we could have to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable. And I think that’s what’s happening at the court because of many people’s courage, especially those directly, personally affected."

Maryland state legislator Don Dwyer is a religious conservative who has called himself ""the face of the opposition"" to gay marriage, chastising fellow legislators to reject it because Jeebus and stuff. Most Americans, however, know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes, there were injuries, and yes, he's still facing charges).
In this new, miserably depressing story on Dwyer, he cites two things as the reasons for the ""increased"" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat, causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature, but more specifically, that time other legislators ""betrayed"" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:
Dwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston, Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage, an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill.
Kach, a Republican from Baltimore County, and Alston, a former Democrat from Prince George’s County, voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted.
Kach and Costa, of Deale, were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in  February.
“I had no time to do anything,” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier, I could have taken some action.”
It was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district, however, rejected it.
“That betrayal really affected me,” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.”
He said his drinking culminated in the crash.

So an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That's some powerful hatred, right there.
In the wake of the crash, Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might, instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to ""defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws,"" but he does admit he needs to rebuild ""trust"" with voters. I don't know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed, but I am not from Maryland, I am not a Republican voter, and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven, allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what it means to be an American religious conservative.

Fox News reporters Greg Jarrett and Ed Henry speak truth* to power:


The issue exposed by Jarrett and Henry? The fact that President Obama has not made any public statements on the murder of college baseball player Christopher Lane, who was white, by three African American teenagers. (See my update below: The teenagers who murdered Lane weren't all African American.)
Why do they think this is notable? Because Obama did offer public comments after Trayvon Martin was killed, and after (in Jarrett's words) ""the black Harvard professor"" got arrested inside his home (Jarrett might not know it, but that professor—Henry Louis Gates—has a name).
In the Jarrett-Henry world, this is is hypocrisy, and it proves that President Obama is a virulent anti-white racist who secretly supports the random murder of white people—as long as the murders are committed by non-whites. Never mind the fact that Obama's mother was white, or that his comments on Gates and Jarrett came in response to questions from reporters. Clearly, Paul LePage was right: Obama hates white people.
Of course, Gates and Jarrett completely ignore the fact that when Trayvon Martin was killed, George Zimmerman—the admitted killer—wasn't arrested until weeks after the murder. Lane's murderers were arrested within 24 hours. That's exactly as should be. His murder was awful, and nothing can change that. But the justice system is working. Without the outrage following Martin's murder, Zimmerman never would have had to defend himself in a court of law.
Jarrett and Henry aren't alone; Fox has spent much of they day posing various forms of the ""where's the outrage question"" and much of the rest of the conservative media is joining in as well. But these guys don't care about Christopher Lane, or really even about what President Obama did or didn't say. As James David Dickson writes in the Detroit News:
The “where’s the outrage?” argument comes in another form: Why don’t black people protest black-on-black violence? What about all those dead kids in Chicago and Detroit? Where’s the march for them?
This is an argument steeped in ignorance. If the people who make it spent even a minute researching, they’d see their premise was faulty. The reason they don’t know that people do care and do march to stop black-on-black violence is because they don’t care about black-on-black violence. They’re trying to use dead black kids in Chicago to stop you from caring about a dead black kid in Florida, when in reality they care about neither.

That's exactly right. Ultimately, this outrage is manufactured to make the Fox audience feel good about themselves when they turn their heads to injustice. It's about making sure they don't forget that they are the real victims here, because who knows what terrible things might happen to the Republican Party if one day Fox viewers woke up and lost that chip on their shoulder.  
*Well, not so much truth as stupid and dishonest race-baiting propaganda.
1:25 PM PT: Wow, it turns out that Fox was even worse than I thought—and that I stupidly fell for part of it. It turns out that the one of the three individuals who murdered Lane was white. So (a) my initial post got that fact wrong, for which I apologize and (b) Fox is even loopier than I originally stated.
Sign our petition demanding that Fox News correct their factual mistake, and cease the despicable race-baiting that has resulted.

Moments after President Obama made his briefing room statement about race and Trayvon Martin, CNN’s BREAKING NEWS graphic swirled, faded, and cut to anchor Brooke Baldwin, who was visibly flushed with excitement. Brooke announced, “Wow, what a surprise we have all witnessed, if you have been tuned in the last half-hour, we were watching THE President surprise everyone…” 
She went on to describe Obama’s statement as “very, very personal; very heartfelt.” Baldwin then assured her audience that Obama had “not used a teleprompter,” because he had “given much thought and much time to making this message VERY personal.”
The CNN anchor then went to a video clip saying, “But FIRST, here’s the president, making this personal.” 
Apparently, Baldwin thought Obama’s statement was personal. 
After the clip, Breathless Brooke returned with her panel: Candy Crowley, Sonny Hostin, Jessica Yellin, and Gloria Borger. 
After another “Wow!”,  Baldwin (who looked like she might have been trembling) turned things over to Chief White House Correspondent, Yellin. 
If you hadn’t known what she was talking about, based solely on Yellin’s awe-inspired melodramatic rhetoric, you would think that something had happened on the level of the first man walking on the moon. Barely able to contain herself, Yellin described Obama’s statement as something “as personal and as bluntly as I have ever heard him speak about racism in America and his own experience of racism in his life.”
Yellin later added that this was “an important moment for this president, and an important moment for America.” 
After again reminding us of how “incredibly personal” Obama was, Baldwin then turned things over to Candy Crowley. 
As excited as the rest, Crowley jumped right in to tell us that Obama is a “thoughtful guy” and the “sort of person who thinks these things through.” 
Crowley obviously missed Obama’s “acted stupid” racial debacle. 
Crowley closed her comment by pointing out that Obama has just “elevated the discussion.” 
Sonny Hostin, the only legal analyst in the country who was shocked by the Zimmerman verdict,  was left a little speechless due to the “so many thoughts she had running through her mind. After mentioning that she was the mother of a “young, brown boy,” she then put those thoughts together and used Obama’s words to trash our country and judicial system as racist. 
Finally, it was political analyst Gloria Borger’s turn, and she started out with some hysterical nonsense about how Obama didn’t want this conversation to be about him — even though this is the second time he has chosen to interject both himself and his race into a local crime that had nothing to with him or racism. Borger found this, “stunning.”
Borger than narrowed her eyes and talked about how Obama came to the podium as an “African-American male and reflected soberly about some important issues we have to discuss in this country.” Borger was in awe over how Obama “distilled ” all of these complicated issues one statement. 
My favorite part of the discussion, though, was Borger’s non sequitar. Baldwin had a good moment when she said that she wanted to make clear that the “Stand your Ground” law had nothing to do with Zimmerman’s defense. 
Borger then jumped in to say, “But it is the law in thirty states.” 
Huh?
Bottom line: For almost fifteen minutes it was hard to tell if you were watching a cable news network, or a slumber party-cam with five breathless Beliebers after a Justin Bieber concert. 
The gushing was as non-stop as the criticism and intelligent insight was non-existent.
Throughout the segment, Obama was constantly referred to as an “African-American.”
Like George Zimmerman, Obama has one white parent. 
CNN, however, only refers to Zimmerman as a “white Hispanic.”
UPDATE: 90 minutes later, CNN is still at it.

If my vagina was a gun, you’d say what it holds is private 
From cold dead hands we could pry, you surely would riot. 
If my vagina was a gun, its rights would all be protected, no matter the body count or the children affected. 
If my vagina was a gun, I could bypass security, concealed carry laws would ensure I’d have impunity. 
If my vagina was a gun, I wouldn’t have to beg you, I could hunt this great land and do all the things men do. 
But my vagina is not a gun, it is a mightier thing, 
With a voice that rings true making lawmakers’ ears ring. 
Vaginas are not delicate, they are muscular and magic, 
So stop messing with mine, with legislation that’s tragic. 
My vagina’s here to demand from the source, 
Listen to the voices of thousands or feel their full force.

19,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/10/Trayvongate,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Trayvongate: Newest Obama Scandal Is 17 Months Old,"

The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old. 
Welcome to Trayvongate, where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit, the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent. 
Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April, 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford, Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something. 
Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions. 
The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:
The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.
However, under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice, the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case, they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘, instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.
Not just George Zimmerman, but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton, along with Jesse Jackson, led the charge. As CBS Miami reported: 
“We live in the middle of an American paradox,” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out, bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.”
“This is not about a hoodie, it’s about racial profiling,” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet, civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”
However, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10,000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:
New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”
The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26.
Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.
J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:
Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap.  In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman, the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01.  It makes it a felony to “by threat, confining or abducting, or imprisoning another person against his . . .  will without lawful authority with intent to . .  . terrorize.”
Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04.  “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands, encourages, hires, or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”
That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous, illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch, the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th, 2012. However, the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead, according the the written record, obtained by Judicial Watch, they “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”
 Once again, the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford. 
These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House, but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator. 
Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.
A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards.
Students from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances.
Charlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.
What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election. 
The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.

Republicans in Wisconsin aren't done regulating lady parts despite 2 bills passed earlier that vastly restrict abortions and mandate ultrasounds.   The quickly rammed through bills were signed in secret by Scott Walker who wanted to avoid the publicity that dogged Republicans in Virginia and caused the Governor of that state to be renamed ""Governor Ultrasound"".
They're not done exerting more control over womens bodies and one State Senator is promising ""all out hell"" if they proceed.
A Democratic state senator promised ""all out hell"" next week if Republicans stick to their plan to take up a controversial bill restricting abortion for public workers and limiting access to contraception for employees of religious organizations.
Sen. Jon Erpenbach (D-Middleton) said Tuesday's session could mirror one in June, when Senate President Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) broke the base of his gavel as he slammed it down to quiet Democrats upset over passing a different abortion bill. Footage of those raucous proceedings was featured in an ad targeting Ellis run by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin.
Republicans who run the Senate are tentatively planning to approve two abortion bills on Tuesday.
One would ban any abortions that are sought because of the sex of the fetus. The other would prevent public employees' health plans from covering most abortions, and would also strictly limit the ability of employees of religious organizations to get contraception through their insurance plans.

That's right.  If you're a public employee, you won't be able to get an abortion and if you work for a religious organization (like a hospital), no birth control for you.
In case you've forgotten, this is how Republicans rammed through these bills in June with only 1 speaker and no debate:

Yes, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling Democrats to sit down and shut up.  After the ram through, the State Senate, as you can see, quickly adjourned.  Democracy doesn't exist for the GOP.


Once again, Republicans refused to hold public hearings, required for major changes. Republicans, however, say that public hearings are ""stalling tactics"" and refuse to hold them.
While Planned Parenthood sued and received an injunction on the recent hospital admitting privileges requirement law for abortion providers, the mandatory ultrasound law has gone into effect unchallenged.   It takes money to litigate and the worst law was the one mandating that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.  
Naturally, Republican Attorney General Van Hollen has appealed the injunction to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals which has scheduled a hearing on December 3.  They will then rule whether or not the injunction stands.  
No one knows what's going to happen when these new atrocities become law in Wisconsin.   They will, of course, become law because the GOP is in the majority and ignore democracy and even the law to ram through every extremist measure they want.  The side of sanity doesn't have the deep pockets of RW billionaires to litigate everything in sight.
For Your Amusement:
The notoriously unreliable and facts optional Politifact has given a rare Pants on Fire to Scott Walker (rare for a Republican to even get questionable ratings) after his claim (in a bulk email sent to supporters) that taxpayers in Wisconsin will save about $640 over 4 years from his shiny new $100 million tax relief.  Bwahahahaha!
Even Walkers puppets said it would amount to only $33 per year and others have said the ""savings"" on the typical home would amount to only between $11 - 13 per year.  
So, yeah, Scotty.  Lie all you want, but this time you went way, way too far and even your pals at Politifact had to call you out.

Concerned citizens lined the gallery of the State Capitol to watch the debate unfold for the Republicans' ultrasound probe law which will require unnecessary and invasive medical treatments on any women seeking an abortion. The bill had already passed through the State Senate, with the dramatic and demonstrably uncivil silencing of any minority party debate, as chronicled by Giles Goat Boy. The lack of collegiality demonstrated by Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis is nothing short of  breathtaking, even for those of us a bit short of breath from two years of constant struggle against this radical governance franchise that has overtaken the state. Witnesses in the gallery testify that he actually broke his gavel from his aggressive pummeling of procedural protocol. That was on Wednesday.


One day later, yesterday, and only two weeks since the Republicans introduced it, the bill passed the House on a 56 to 39 vote. During what passed for debate, the citizens in the gallery sat silent, some with duct tape over their mouths. The gallery was lined with Capitol Police, whose job it is to oversee the increasingly detailed and labyrinthine sets of rules of conduct and laws restricting assembly that have been put in place during the last two years. It has been clear that signage is no longer allowed in the gallery, nor is photography, nor recording devices of any kinds. I don't know that we were cognizant that silence would not be allowed. That's right: in Wisconsin, our silence has been silenced!
According to the twitter stream of Madison writer and activist Rebecca Kemble's eyewitness account:
       
Women with tape over their mouths silently protesting #gynogovt in Assembly Gallery told to take it off. Some of them ejected. #WarOnWomen
 

Clapping spontaneously erupted after Democratic Representative Sandy Pasch spoke of the importance of access to birth control for women:
Rep. Pasch on AB 216: ""The author of this bill is seriously out of touch with the reality of women."" #gynogovt #WarOnWomen
Applause from the gallery causes Speaker Pro Tem Kramer to have people removed without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomen
 
Dems protesting Kramer's ejection of the public from the gallery without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomen
One woman was handcuffed and marched out due to her unwillingness to leave the gallery when Rep. Kramer cleared the first two rows due to clapping.

Women in the gallery who removed tape from their mouths on the order of Speaker Pro Tem Kramer now holding hands over mouths. #gynogovt

       
I'll end with that chilling image. A radical bill of serious consequence was fast-tracked through legislature and now waits to be signed by Governor Walker. He's already said that he has no problem with ultrasounds, and will readily sign. The Senate allowed no debate, insisting on a rapid and violent roll-call vote. The House allowed the performance of debate and voted along party lines. The citizens watching from the galleries above were surrounded by police. There were no outbursts, no incivility, only one instance of clapping. The first two rows were immediately ejected, without warning, by the order of the Republican Speaker.
Women sitting silently with duct tape on their mouths were given the ultimatum: take off your tape, or face arrest. They took off their tape, and sat silently with their hands over their mouths. No talking allowed. No clapping allowed. No noise allowed. No silence allowed.

On Friday, two prominent Republican backers of the Senate immigration bill hosted a conference call with reporters to reveal the “history” behind some organizations opposing the legislation. According to the speakers, a significant amount of the opposition to immigration reform is being led by liberals, environmentalists and pro-abortion and eugenics activists worried about population growth. 
“[T]he primary leaders and funders of the anti-immigration movement were drawn to it because they were also active organizers and supporters of, and contributors to, the population-control movement in the United States,” Mario Lopez, a speaker on the call, recently wrote. Lopez is President of the Hispanic Leadership Fund. Lopez was joined on the call by Josh Culling, with Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform.
This ad hominem argument is both inane and irrelevant. People come into issues from all kinds of vantage points. I have no doubt that there active immigration reform opponents who are liberals or have overblown worries about population growth. Those views, however, don’t discredit what they may say on a different issue. Nor do those views discredit what people without those views believe on an issue. 
Friday’s call was a leftist tactic to discount what millions of Americans feel about an issue because some other people hold views with which they would disagree. It was reminiscent of the media’s attempt to smear the entire Tea Party movement because a handful of people said or did something stupid. 
Even if one were to cede the premise that an entire infrastructure to oppose immigration reform were built by population control activists, the fact is immaterial to the concerns many have about the legislation before the Senate. Even if you support expansive legal immigration, it is a bad bill. Its fatal flaw is that it doesn’t secure the border or increase enforcement in any meaningful way. One doesn’t have to be a population control zealot to see the fundamental problem with that approach. 
Surely, the speakers would hopefully acknowledge, there are many opposed to the Senate bill who don’t believe in population control. I would wager the overwhelming majority of Americans who have concerns about the bill are not advocates of abortion or eugenics to control the population. So, why are the views of a decided minority relevant to an issue with national implications? 
The richest irony of the call was that the speakers are allies of groups like SEIU and La Raza in supporting the specific Senate proposal. One could just as easily have a convened a press call to discuss the “history” behind these groups and why conservatives should be cautious about working with them. The speakers on the call, for example, acknowledged doing at least some work with the National Immigration Forum, which has received considerable funding from George Soros’ Open Society Institute. Is that the proper alliance for a conservative?
No one should schedule such a call, however. Issues should be decided on merits, not ad hominem aspersions about someone else’s motives. The call was an attempt to smear all opposition to the Senate bill as arising out of the questionable beliefs of a few people. It was an attempt to quash, rather than foster, debate on the underlying merits of the proposal.
The call also perpetuated a dangerously false choice. Conservatives should either accept legislation largely written by Sen. Chuck Schumer or be labeled as against reform. That our allies are forcing this choice is unconscionable.

After Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspected Boston Marathon bomber whose older brother was killed earlier in a shootout, was captured alive on Friday after a extensive manhunt, a dour President Barack Obama addressed the nation. While he was adamant that the American people do not hold these heinous acts against “entire groups of people,” he did not mention radical Islam at all.
In a stoic Friday evening address that was in contrast to the jubilant atmosphere on Boston’s streets, Obama spoke of the “resolve and determination” of those in Boston, sent his condolences to the family of the MIT police officer who was murdered on Friday by the suspects, and praised Boston’s police officers. 
He vowed to “determine what happened” and find “any associations these terrorists may have had.” Obama also said, “we’ve seen the character of this country” during this “tough week” and that the people of Boston refused to be intimidated and Americans “refuse to be terrorized.” 
He became most animated, though, when speaking about how Americans should not “latch on to any bit of information sometimes to jump to conclusions” before facts are “relentlessly” gathered. 
“That’s why we take care not to rush to judgement, not about the motivations of these individuals and certainly not about entire groups of people,” Obama said. 
Contrary to what Obama and the mainstream media may think, Americans do not “rush to judgment” without any evidence. In this case, there has already been plenty of pieces of evidence to suggest radical Islam may have influenced the suspected bombers, especially older brother Tamerlan.
In an interview with Russia Today, the mother of the suspects said the FBI “were scared of my oldest son” because “they always told me he’s a leader,” and they were “afraid of him because, you know, he is a leader, he talks about Islam a lot.”
She said her eldest son got involved in “religious politics” five years ago, and the FBI was scared of him because of the information he was getting from “extremist” websites. 
But the mother, perhaps like Obama, seemed to be in denial by claiming her sons could not be involved in Jihad and were “set up” by the FBI. The mother claimed the sons would have told her of the terrorist attacks if they really, in her mind, had intended to bomb the Boston Marathon.
On Monday evening, in his first address to the nation after the Boston Marathon bombings, Obama did not refer to the bombings as terrorism. Immediately after he spoke, the White House had to issue a statement that they considered the bombings an “act of terror.”
Obama had to clean up the mess on Tuesday and do damage control in what seemed like a press conference that was called just so Obama could say the words “act of terror” on camera. 
Robert Baer, a former CIA official, said on Friday that that there is a “cultural fight” between radical Islam and the West, and the older brother may have “identified with Jihadism” when “he found religion and wanted to defend Islam” because “it gave him meaning.” Even Piers Morgan, Even Piers Morgan, who is largely sympathetic to Obama and his agenda, discussed the suspected bomber’s potential ties to radical Islam on Friday evening. 
But the Obama administration consistently seems to be either oblivious to or dismissive of the threat of global Jihad. And while Obama has rightfully warned Americans not to make judgments without evidence, Obama has too often ignored evidence of radical Islam’s influence. 
For instance,  the Obama administration refused to call the Fort Hood massacre an act of terror, instead referring to it as “workplace violence.” He also took three days to address the nation after the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing in 2009. "

apparently, at least according to one Red State diary by a John Hayward, published November 7th, 2013.    Link
This was a long, Very Serious, examination of the reasons why the ""conservatism"" of the Tea Party doesn't resonate with single women, and what can be done about it.  Opening statement (italics in original):
The Virginia governor’s race was yet another example of the massive voting gap in a huge demographic: single people, particularly single women.  According to exit polls, Republican Ken Cuccinelli won handily on the “hard” issues facing Virginia voters, and won most other demographic slices, but Democrat Terry McAuliffe won big with single people, crushing Cuccinelli by nearly fifty points among single women.
Jaw-dropping quote for me below the single orange swirlyQ


Maybe I shouldn't be surprised that anyone would think this in this country, much less say it aloud, but here it is:
How can conservatives adjust their strategy to appeal more strongly to the single female society?  Well, one obvious approach would be restricting the vote to people who are married.
Now I'm not quite sure how that's supposed to appeal to single women.  It seems to me that if you just go ahead and disenfranchise single women (or blacks, or Latinos, or poor people, or people who don't drive for whatever reason), well then, that solves your problem right there. No need to have policies or platforms that appeal to people who can't vote, right?  So it's kind of illogical on its face.  But it's also just mind-bogglingly bizarro as well.
A couple of quotes from the comments:
The goal of the GOP should be to resist urbanization, not just because of the voting trends, but because urban life leads to a lower standard of living.
So people who live in cities shouldn't vote either I guess?
Speaking as someone with a paid off mortgage I still oppose the idea of property owners being the cut point. Taxpayer is a perfectly good one. Best would be to first seize the vocabulary, change out 'entitlement' for 'public charity.' Then anyone who declares themselves destitute and in need of public charity would be a lot easier to drop from the voter rolls. They would have declared themselves incapable of maintaining themselves; why do they get to tell the rest of us how to run the country if they can't take care of themselves?
I knew about only allowing property owners to vote...
Now my little diary doesn't explore the author's myriad reasons why single women are the problem, but here's his opening generalization:
The single female demographic doesn’t get hung up on details.  Another of the new liberal icons, Wendy Davis of Texas, couldn’t answer basic questions about the abortion legislation she opposed with a purportedly heroic filibuster.  Now she’s claiming she is actually kinda sorta “pro life” when you think about it.  This is true of all the emotional appeals directed at single female society – lack of knowledge is not only overshadowed by passionate conviction, it can be a point of pride.
I was mainly just impressed by how much Red State conservatives don't want people to vote, to the point where disenfranchisement is a Serious Discussion.
I can only conclude that it's because what Kos always says about our base, if our people vote WE WIN.
Thanks for listening.  I was partly practicing block quotes and links.  If I have overstepped the rules for linking to Mr Hayward's diary I stand properly chastised.

The virulent meme spread across our nation with increasing frequency by Republicans and their racist adherents is that ""anti-racism"" is a code for ""anti-white."" This is part of a larger pattern of stigmatization of any groups or efforts made to address and redress the racial inequities we still face, and there are myriad variations on the theme, including ""reverse racism,"" ""reverse discrimination"" and ""playing the race card"" or simply a dismissal of anyone who attempts to combat racism by labeling them a racist.
Far too frequently we see headlines blasting racist blatherings by Republican politicians and party officials, local, state and national, and their faithful followers repeat these falsities ad nauseam on internet forums, in LTE's, newspaper comments and in personal conversations among family, friends and co-workers.

The organization that takes the hardest hit from those who clearly want to distort its message and purpose is the venerable NAACP, the oldest of the nation's civil rights organizations.
Headlines like, ""House freshman calls NAACP chief 'racist' in email"", ""Extremist Hate Group NAACP wants Robert E. Lee’s picture taken down in Florida"" (I'm not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound, and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin  Jealous, whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time, they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages.
Other newer organizations, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike, since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is), and Joseph J. Levin, Jr.
I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history.  
The Birth of the NAACP
The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington, journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans, and a meeting date was set for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later, this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization.
The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family),Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP.
On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House, from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged, calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30, 1910, members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers, who were:
    National President, Moorfield Storey, Boston
    Chairman of the Executive Committee, William English Walling
    Treasurer, John E. Milholland (a Lincoln Republican and Presbyterian from New York)
    Disbursing Treasurer, Oswald Garrison Villard
    Executive Secretary, Frances Blascoer
    Director of Publicity and Research, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.

Much to the surprise of many not familiar with this history, many of these founders were white. Though I spent years studying black history with W.E.B. Dubois and Ida Wells-Barnett as two of my favorite subjects, it wasn't until later in my studies that I focused on any of the white founders. I'll feature two of them here today.
 

NAACP founding member Mary White Ovington

Mary White Ovington:
Mary White Ovington was born April 11, 1865 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women's rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College, Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church. In 1895 she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year, Ovington remained until 1904 when she was appointed fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations she met W.E.B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement.
...On September 3, 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling, also a Liberal, entitled ""Race War in the North"" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, February 12, 1909...
After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as board member, executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947, ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15, 1951.


William English Walling, Chairman of NAACP Executive Committee (1910–1911)

William English Walling:
William English Walling (1877–1936) (known as ""English"" to friends and family) was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the grandson of William Hayden English, the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1880, and was born into wealth. He was educated at the University of Chicago and at Harvard Law School. He was a co-founder of the NAACP, and founded the National Women's Trade Union League in 1903.
In 1906, following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky, a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message, a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield, Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations, Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent, in which he stated, “the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln and Lovejoy, must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP.

So here we have two staunch anti-racists who helped found an anti-racist organization 104 years ago. Clearly not anti-white. But let's fast forward to today. Though the NAACP does not keep racial demographics for its membership, and yes, a majority are black Americans, NAACP membership is open to all. The current head of the Aiken County, South Carolina Branch of the NAACP, Phillip Howell, is white. There are also local chapter heads who are Latino.
I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being ""anti-black"" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly ""white"" organizations over the years, from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact, no one ever calls them ""white"" groups at all, they are just ""groups,"" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society, one must add an adjective to describe anything else.
I've voted for white presidents and white senators, attended mostly white colleges and universities, with the exception of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard, due to its history and founding purpose, is ""a historically black college"" (HBCU), which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students, especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard, for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury, before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school.
The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party, assuming it was anti-white, simply because of it having ""black"" in the name, and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well.
So next time you encounter someone, online or in real life, spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group, hit them with the facts.
Better still, if you are white, why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your ""card"" for real.

27,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/07/10/Trayvongate,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Trayvongate: Newest Obama Scandal Is 17 Months Old,"

The newest Obama scandal is seventeen months old. 
Welcome to Trayvongate, where the President of the United States used both the bully pulpit, the Department of Justice and sly media manipulation to gin up charges of racism in the George Zimmerman/Trayvon Martin shooting. Now that the trial is almost finished and the only act of racism mentioned so far came from the victim–Martin called Zimmerman ‘a creepy ass cracker’ according to testimony–the cynical and repeated use of the race card by the White house is even more abhorrent. 
Judicial Watch revealed documents today that proved what Breitbart News reported in April, 2012: that Eric Holder’s Department of Justice took an active role in racially charged rallies in Sanford, Florida and that the Community Relations Service helped force the temporary resignation of Sheriff Bill Lee. That resignation made it appear that Sanford authorities were suspect and possibly complicit in covering up something. 
Some of my reporting at the time was based on interviews with numerous public officials in Sanford who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution from the Obama administration. They described a situation where the CRS team took over and forced decisions while clearing a path for protests and rallies that heightened the appearence of racial tensions. 
The CRS is a small unit within the Department of Justice and ostensibly it serves a legitimate purpose; attempting to cool down tense situation. As its website says:
The Community Relations Service is the Department’s “peacemaker” for community conflicts and tensions arising from differences of race, color, and national origin. Created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, CRS is the only Federal agency dedicated to assist State and local units of government, private and public organizations, and community groups with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, incidents, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.
However, under the highly politicized Holder Department of Justice, the CRS has acted as ‘spies and muscle’ according to a source familiar with the unit. In the Zimmerman case, they ended up as doing nothing to facilitate ‘racial stability and harmony ‘, instead acting a heavy thumb on the scales of justice and helping to force events that gave the nation an impression that Martin’s death was racially motivated.
Not just George Zimmerman, but the police and the entire town were targeted in rallies that saw people being bused-in for protests. We now have proof via the Judicial Watch release that these rallies were facilitated by the Obama administration. They were also highly racially charged. Close Obama ally Al Sharpton, along with Jesse Jackson, led the charge. As CBS Miami reported: 
“We live in the middle of an American paradox,” Rev. Sharpton told the crowd. “We can put a black man in the White House but we cannot walk a black child through a gated neighborhood. We are not selling out, bowing out or backing down until there is justice for Trayvon.”
“This is not about a hoodie, it’s about racial profiling,” Jackson said. “We will use our marching feet, civil disobedience and every weapon in our non-violent arsenal until justice is served.”
However, much of the rhetoric surrounding the Zimmerman story was violent. Many will remember that the New Black Panther party actually offered a $10,000 bounty for the ‘capture’ of George Zimmerman. As the Orlando Sentinal reported:
New Black Panther leader Mikhail Muhammad announced the reward during a protest in Sanford Saturday. And when asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied defiantly: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”
The bounty announcement came moments after members of the group called for the mobilization of 10,000 black men to capture Zimmerman, who shot Trayvon in a gated Sanford community on Feb. 26.
Muhammad said members of his group would search for Zimmerman themselves in Maitland — where the 28-year old worked before the shooting, employees there told the Orlando Sentinel. He declined to say when the group would begin their search.
J. Christian Adams knows the New Black Panther Party well; he resigned his position at the DOJ over the refusal to prosecute the Panthers for the now infamous Philadephia voter intimidation actions during the 2008 election. Adams outlined the crimes committed by the NBPP in Sanford:
Let’s start with solicitation to kidnap.  In announcing a reward for the seizure of Zimmerman, the New Black Panthers may have violated Florida Code 787.01.  It makes it a felony to “by threat, confining or abducting, or imprisoning another person against his . . .  will without lawful authority with intent to . .  . terrorize.”
Merely soliciting someone else to do this is also a felony in Florida under Florida Code 777.04.  “A person who solicits another to commit an offense prohibited by law and in the course of such solicitation commands, encourages, hires, or requests another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute such offense or an attempt to commit such offense commits the offense of criminal solicitation.”
That’s only part of the list. The New Black Panther’s outrageous, illegal call for vigilante justice happened on March 24th. According the records obtained by Judicial Watch, the Department of Justice deployed to Sanford the next day: March 25th, 2012. However, the DOJ did not go to Sanford to make arrests against the New Black Panthers. Instead, according the the written record, obtained by Judicial Watch, they “deployed to Sanford, FL, to work marches, demonstrations, and rallies related to the shooting and death of an African-American teen by a neighborhood watch captain.”
 Once again, the Holder Department of Justice failed to prosecute the New Black Panther Party. They actually helped facilitate mass rallies against Zimmerman and the City of Sanford. 
These actions are made even more scandalous by the direct insertion of the President of the United States into the story. President Obama made his famous “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” remark at the White House, but what got considerably less press was the fact that Obama had a prior relationship with Martin’s attorney Benjamin Crump. Obama worked with him on another racially charged case when he was a Senator. 
Breitbart News reported on the Obama connection to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.
A rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards.
Students from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances.
Charlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.
What we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election. 
The only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.

Obama’s Debt Default Is on His Shoulders While We Shoulder His Impeachable Offenses
Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?
It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However, we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So, he’s scaremongering the markets about default, just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security, which, by the way, is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.
It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.

Uh, no. Neither budget, thanks.



Uh, no. Neither budget, thanks.

So if you are the party committees in charge of electing Democrats in 2014, and your base is up in arms over President Barack Obama's unforced error on his budget's Social Security cuts, what do you do?
If you're smart, like the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, you say nothing (at least so far). Why rub salt in the wounds of your strongest supporters? But if you're the guys at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, you ask them to cheer louder. In an email blast:
What does backfire look like?
Instead of compromising to get solutions on the budget, NRCC Chairman Greg Walden outrageously attacked parts of President Obama’s budget proposal that were included at the demand of Republicans.""

Ah yes, DCCC, your supporters are outraged that Republicans won't applaud the cutting of Social Security benefits—cuts, by the way, that weren't even included in Paul Ryan's draconian cut-everything-else budget. I'm sure that brought in the dough from outraged Democratic donors desperate for ""compromise"" with recalcitrant Republicans!
But the DCCC isn't the only one stepping off the cliff with the president. The Democratic Governor's Association decided to play lemming as well.
President Obama just released a budget for next year that will reduce the deficit while investing in the things we need to keep our economy competitive for the long-term – like pre-K for four-year olds.
On the other side, Paul Ryan and House Republicans have a budget that spends your hard-earned money on tax breaks for the wealthiest, ends Medicare and Social Security as we know them, and slashes other critical programs.
Stand with us in supporting President Obama’s budget and say no to Paul Ryan’s disaster of a plan.

There's no doubt that Ryan's budget is a piece of shit, but if you're going to be outraged at cuts in Ryan's budget (which again, doesn't include the president's chained CPI proposal), then why would you want to stand with Obama's budget?
You wouldn't. A Social Security cut is a Social Security cut, no matter who proposes it. Heck, it's worse when proposed by Democrats. Republicans are assholes. We expect them to slash the safety net. But Democrats? If we stand for anything at all, we stand for taking care of each other.
Sign this petition telling the DCCC and the DGA that that that's what we should be standing for. Not Obama's cut-Social Security budget.

30,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/22/Report-Rogue-IRS-Agent-Claim-Unraveling,News,Breitbart,Republican,Report: 'Rogue' IRS Agent Claim Unraveling,"

An investigation by Cincinnati Fox 19 reporter Ben Swann finds that Obama Administration claims that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) targeting of conservative groups was the work of two “rogue” low-level employees in Cincinnati, Ohio, strain credulity and are “falling apart.”
Swann reports that so far six IRS agents working out of the Cincinnati office–which is the central hub for processing tax-exempt applications–have been identified as sending scrutinizing letters to conservative groups. These include: 
These agents report to different managers, with a territory manager overseeing those managers.
Swann explains how the process works:
When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS, agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. When that happens, individual agents are required to input a status update on that individual case once a month, every month until the case is resolved.
Keep in mind, at least 300 groups were targeted out of Cincinnati alone. Those applications spent anywhere from 18 months to nearly 3 years in the system and some still don’t have their non-profit status. 300 groups multiplied by at least 18 months for each group, means thousands of red flags would have been generated in the system. 
So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer, according to the IRS directory, one woman in Cincinnati, Cindy Thomas, the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division. Because all six of our IRS workers have different individual and territory managers, Cindy Thomas is one manager they all have common. 
It turns out Cindy Thomas’ name is one we have heard before. The independent journalism group ProPublica says in November of 2012 they had requested information on conservatives groups that had received non-profit status. 
Cindy Thomas, says Swann, is the highest-ranking employee in the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Department in Cincinnati. 
Democrats unleashed a barrage of pointed questions to IRS officials on Wednesday in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) said if witnesses today are not more forthcoming and continue to stonewall the committee, “it will lead to a special prosecutor” in order “to get to the bottom of this.” He warned that “there will be hell to pay if that’s the route we go down.”
“It is possible that criminal activity may have occurred,” said Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George."

According to Nancy Pelosi, it's time to embrace the suck. Our own front pager, Laura Clawson, would seem to agree when she wrote her piece Budget deal not as bad as expected for federal workers without a trace of irony. I don't think I recognize the front page anymore. Since when are any changes that reduce retirement wages acceptable to the progressive community?
Although my husband is not a federal worker in the sense we all think about, he does work for the federal goverment. He is a military officer and he is due to retire in the next few years. We're part of the community being asked to embrace the suck. This budget deal will take an estimated $124,000 from our pockets. It will take that much from every officer who has recently retired and who will retire in the near future. The budget deal would take an estimated $80,000 from the pockets of an Army Sergeant 1st Class. All combined, the deal will save the military a grand $6 Billion in 10 years, a pittance to the military budget but a devastating loss of money to each family.
The military community is in an uproar. But the civilian community, not so much. I would imagine that's why the diaries earlier this week received so little attention. Did you miss those? In my opinion, first time diarist, aznavy deserved to at least make the Community Spotlight for his piece, Military Retirees Thrown Under the Bus For Defense Contractors:
""Spread the pain to the youngest military retirees""  - the most likely to have spent multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thank you for your service. It just cost you $83K or $123K. Our military industrial complex thanks you. On behalf of Congress, they also thank you for your service.
Future thank you's could include Tricare benefit cuts, pay raise caps, narrower VA eligibility criteria...the list seems endless. http://www.nj.com/....
Why go on, it is only depressing. Please, don't thank me for my service anymore...it only costs me and my comrades in arms money.
Shared sacrifice - my ass.



I also wrote a diary, ""Working Age"" Military Retirees Screwed Over in the Ryan/Murray Deal. In it, I highlight all those places that Congress could have cut the military budget, items that the Pentagon itself wanted to cut, and Congress chose not to. Why? Because those cuts would mean ending contracts with companies in their districts. Just.to.hard.to.do.
So instead, Congress is going to repeat it's 1990-style military retiree screw you over deal. Back then, it was health care. Military retirees had been promised a lifetime of free healthcare. They lost it when Congress and President Clinton signed a budget agreement that started to charge retirees for seeing the doctor. They fought back but they fought alone because the civilian community didn't see such a big deal at the time. For 20 years, many a military member has cussed out Clinton for his part in all of this. In fact, I would say it was one of the major reasons why vocal military opinion swayed against Democrats for so long.
Now we're going to see President Obama sign similar legislation. Different retiree benefit but just another generation of military retirees to screw over. Don't think we're getting screwed? Military families certainly do:
From a military spouse at MilitarySpouse.com:
We’ve embraced many hardships.  I’ve sacrificed plenty over the years. I know I personally gave up my career to support my husbands – without regret.  My occupation is not portable, so I’ll have to start over – someday, when I stop moving every two years.
My youngest is five years old and she’s already lived in four states.  I’ve said goodbye to family, knowing we’ll never live in the same state again.  Because aren’t all grandparents meant for Skyping and not sleepovers?  My children are forced to change schools every two years, expected to make new friends and adapt to imbalances in education from state to state.
My husband’s office is an intricate part of the national defense of our country.  So, that means T-ball games are missed, so are school plays, recitals, activities, help with home work, bed time routines and of course, family vacations.   Not to mention, let’s send you off to a war zone for an unknown amount of time, too.   My husband has spent 20 years in the United States military. It’s not your typical day job.
And, quite frankly, I think I have it pretty good. I know other military families out there have it a lot worse.  I’ve embraced my suck, we all do.
So, when I hear the Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi (D), spout out in a news conference, we have to “embrace the suck”, I want to scream!
How about trying out a new slogan “Embrace Your Promise.”  

So how about it? Are you with us or against us?
You can send a letter to your Representative, your Senators, and President Obama in one single go by visiting the Military Officers Association of America. You don't have to be military, just mark that you're an MOAA Family/Friend.
And please, show the front pagers that this issue is important. Rec the diary and get this issue some attention. Please.

32,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/09/miss-obama-budget-to-congress-9-weeks-late,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Obama Budget to Congress 9 Weeks Late,"

On Friday, Pentagon officials informed a House committee that the President’s formal budget proposal wouldn’t be delivered to Congress until April 8th, more than two months past the statutory deadline. Under federal law, the President is required to submit his budget blueprint to Congress no later than the first Monday in February. President Obama has met that deadline only once. 
When asked at a press briefing Friday, White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest wouldn’t confirm the budget’s release. “I don’t have a budget date to announce to you,” he said. It is telling that the White House didn’t inform Congress of the delay, but left the task to budget staff at the Pentagon. 
A major part of a President’s job is to manage the Executive Branch and its numerous federal agencies. The President’s budget proposal is the Administration’s estimation of the resources it will need to meet its mission and priorities for the coming year. Historically, the President submits his budget before Congress gets to work on a final spending plan. 
This year, however, House and Senate Budget authors will unveil their spending plans weeks ahead of President Obama. Like many other legislative deliberations, Obama will be on the sidelines. 
Senate Budget Committee Ranking Member Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the delay. “He will be submitting it after the House and Senate have produced a budget proposal and adjourned for Easter. So while the President speaks of his deep concern for American workers and families, he fails to even submit to Congress his financial plan to help those workers and families.”
Since Obama took office, the government has mostly been on auto-pilot. Senate Democrats have refused for the past four years to even bring a budget plan to the floor for a vote. This inaction has caused the government to run on a series of “continuing resolutions”, which simply extend all current spending, with modest increases, for a set period of time. 
As a result, there have been no real talks about prioritizing spending nor reducing or eliminating ineffective programs. It has allowed Obama and the Democrats to give lip-service to the need to cut spending, without having to provide any specific recommendations. It’s budgetary shadow-boxing. 
Obama is simply uninterested in the day-to-day workload required to successfully manage the federal government. He can’t even be bothered when federal law requires that he “show his work” to the nation.

33,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/02/Obama-debt-ceiling,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Who Will Stop Bully Obama on Debt Ceiling?,"
With President Obama set to precipitate a constitutional crisis over the upcoming debt ceiling, Republicans in Congress must now stand up to the bullying commander in chief. 
Yesterday, after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress, President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently,” he told supporters, “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates, permanently, making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”
But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat, will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things,” Obama said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course, Obama has racked up those bills, and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was, ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit,'” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s spokeswoman.
Under the Constitution of the United States, the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt, not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.
That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past, the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling. 
So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011, Republicans in Congress caved, and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.
Now, however, they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together, and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving, or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election, he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011, during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that, and act accordingly.

Breitbart News has learned that Tea Party Patriots is asking its members to pressure Congress to conduct a full and thorough investigation into the IRS’s targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations. 
The organization is calling on Congress to conduct “substantive” investigative hearings in the wake of recent reports that senior IRS officials knew in 2011 exactly what was going on, despite initial claims that local “low-level” employees were the only ones involved in targeting conservatives.
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said that on Friday “we learned that the IRS lied to Congress and the American citizens when Douglas Schulman said there was ‘absolutely no targeting’ of Tea Party groups who applied for nonprofit status.” Martin was referencing Schulman’s March 2012 Congressional testimony.
Today we are learning that the IRS lied when they said that only “low-level employees” were to blame for outrageous and egregious overreach and abuse of power. The AP is reporting in June 2011, IRS division head Lois Lerner instructed employees to change the criteria for “flagging groups ‘immediately'” and in August 2011 “the IRS” Rulings and Agreements office “held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information.”  
A Saturday report by the Associated Press, citing a draft of a forthcoming Inspector General report, found that “senior Internal Revenue Service officials knew agents were targeting Tea Party groups as early as 2011.” The AP notes that this report’s findings “seemingly contradicts public statements by the IRS commissioner.”
On Friday, the IRS admitted to targeting conservative and Tea Party groups and apologized for the behavior. But with this new information, Martin said her organization “rejects the apology from the Internal Revenue Service.”
“It appears the IRS committed crimes and violated our ability to exercise our First Amendment Right to Free Speech,” Martin said. “A simple apology is not sufficient reparation for violating the Constitutional rights of United States citizens.”
In the release, Martin said Tea Party Patriots is “encouraged to hear that Congress plans to investigate. Those responsible must be held accountable and must resign or be terminated for their actions.”  
Martin also asked conservative grassroots activists “around the country to help us with two things.”
First, she asked activists to help make sure “that the hearings in Congress are substantive and get to the bottom of this scandal to reveal how deep it runs, how many other lies the IRS has told related to the these tactics, and what will be done to insure no other group of citizens is so unfairly discriminated against solely because they are speaking out against rampant government.” She called on members to “call your Member of Congress and both of your Senators to let them know that we must get to the bottom of this scandal.”
Second, she said Tea Party Patriots needs to “hear from you if you or your local group has felt intimidated by the IRS actions over the last 4 years.” 
Are you part of a local group who applied for tax-exempt status? What is the status of that application?  Did you set out to form a group but were so intimidated by the IRS tactics that you abandoned that goal and wound up participating only as individuals rather than incorporating and coordinating activity with other groups?

(Boy do I love being able to type those words - ""Sen. Warren"")
Oh yeah, there's a new sheriff in town.
Previous diaries have illuminated the sputtering non-responses of regulators (Comptroller of Currency, SEC, etc.) to Sen. Warren's (sort of rhetorical) questions, who were not able to say when they had taken any banker to trial.
But the true sign that her line of questioning struck a nerve with bankers accustomed to the comfy status quo, was in the immediate, terrified howling pushback by numerous banking executives - who refuse to come out into the open and identify themselves, rather remain anonymous.
Elizabeth Warren asked why banks traded below book value while most corporations trade above book value. She proposed some possible explanations:
""One would be because nobody believes that the banks' books are honest,"" she said. ""Second, would be that nobody believes that the banks are really manageable. That is, if they are too complex either for their own institutions to manage them or for the regulators to manage them.""
Predictably, the banksters did not take kindly to having the curtain pulled back:
She also earned significant ire from bankers with her line that one reason big banks mostly trade below book value may be that “nobody believes” their books are honest. Most of the complaints came on background or off the record given that these bankers have to deal with Warren in the Senate for at least six years and perhaps much longer and are (apparently quite justifiably) freaked out at the prospect.


As one top bank executive (who refused to identify himself and stand by his words)  explained in an angry email to Politico's Morning Money, Sen. Warren is just plain wrong!
One top exec emailed: “While Senator Warren had every right to ask pointed questions at today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, her claim that ‘nobody believes’ that bank books are honest is just plain wrong. As Federal Reserve Governor Tarullo explained in response to her question, the low valuations are more likely due to continued economic uncertainty and concerns on the part of investors regarding the impact on banks' profitability due to the hundreds of new regulations, higher levels of required capital, and significant activity restrictions.
Ooh and some threats, I bet this has scared the (not) junior (anymore) Senator from MA:
“It is for these very important reasons that the financial services industry has urged regulators to get implementation right — that is, to carry out the instructions and intentions of Congress in a manner that produces a safe and sound, competitive and innovative industry. That's what today's hearing was supposed to be about — not some shameless grandstanding. Perhaps someone ought to remind the Senator that the campaign is over and she should act accordingly if she wants to be taken seriously.”
Apparently Senator Warren does not know her proper place!  This guy had the gall to equate Sen. Warren standing up to the banksters to the deals between Chuck Hagel and North Korea dreamt up in Ted Cruz's fevered imagination.
The anonymous banker followed up: “Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz are dueling for the title of ""most extreme fringe freshman senator.""
But at least one banker was willing to be identified, even if his rationale undercut the previous theory that low valuations are the result of 'continued economic uncertainty'.  
CONSUMER BANKERS ASSOCATION President and CEO Richard Hunt emails in response to Warren: “We have been through more tests and thorough exams than any college student over the past four years, including many conducted by the CFPB. The results of the Hamilton Partners Financial Index and the testimony of OCC Comptroller [Thomas] Curry were very clear: the United States banking system is safe and sound, supported by historic and permanent capital ratios. We are working every day to fulfill the financial needs of the American consumer and small business and will continue to work with any and all lawmakers who seek to assist in this extremely important process.”
At long last, average Americans have a voice speaking for them against Wall St. banksters. Senator Warren came out swinging in her first committee hearing and we no doubt have much more of this to look forward to. There is indeed a new sheriff in town and she has gotten their attention.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, bane of the right wing and advocate of the empowerment agenda



Senator Elizabeth Warren, bane of the right wing and advocate of the empowerment agenda

There are a lot of things not to like from a progressive perspective about the so-called Ryan-Murray compromise budget approved this past Wednesday by the Senate and on its way to President Obama's desk. Perhaps the biggest is the expiration of long-term unemployment insurance benefits. These cuts will provide a very inopportune lump of coal in the stockings of the least fortunate right at the time that they need these benefits the most. And with Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives, the probability of these benefits being restored once they expire seems barely a stitch above zero.
Thankfully, as Greg Sargent writes, Democrats in the Senate and progressive institutions are refusing to concede the point. And whether they actually hope to embarrass Republicans into passing a new extension of benefits, or whether the only expectation is to use the issue to turn public opinion even further against a heartless Republican Party, the efforts involved look like they will be extensive.
Please read below the fold for more on the fight over unemployment benefits.


1) Liberal groups will launch a national TV ad campaign that hits Republicans for letting benefits expire for over one million Americans, to be launched the day after Christmas and run on national cable through at least December 28th, the day benefits are set to expire. The ads will also highlight GOP priorities by spotlighting GOP opposition to nixing loopholes enjoyed by the top one percent even as a lifeline expires for over one million far less fortunate Americans.
There may also be a second round of ads launched when Congress returns in early January. The ads — backed by a “significant” buy, a source says — will be run by Americans United for Change. Other groups involved in the broader campaign include the National Employment Law project, AFSCME, the AFL-CIO, SEIU, and UAW.
2) House Democrats are planning a big push in local media, with the goal of using local coverage to dramatize how constituents in Republican districts will be impacted by the expiration of benefits. This is hyper-granular stuff: I’m told Ways and Means Committee Dems are collecting county-by-county data on the number of people who will be kicked off benefits, and pushing local press outlets to reflect these numbers in their coverage.
The idea is to make it harder for individual lawmakers to escape the direct consequences, in their districts, of failing to renew benefits, bringing it home ...
3) Liberal groups are drawing up lists of House Republicans who are both vulnerable and reside in states where unemployment is high. The targeting of them will take various forms, such as conference calls — directed at local media in their states and districts — that feature people who are losing benefits.
Meanwhile, labor unions are planning events in states, and liberal groups are planning polls on unemployment benefits in both marginal districts and nationally. Results should be released next week.

Sargent notes that the ultimate objective of this campaign is to convince voters, despite the media's automatic inclination to blame ""Congress"" for any gridlock or federal  inaction, that the blame for failing to pass an extension of this popular program and hurting 1.3 million Americans in the process falls squarely on the Republican Party. And just as with the contrast between Democrats and Republicans on maintaining current levels of food assistance programs for the neediest, there is certainly room to gain political ground from the electorate by campaigning on conservative heartlessness toward the poor—especially when said conservatives insist on having poor kids sweep school floors to earn their lunches while their wealthier counterparts stand idly by.
Without question, maintaining food stamps and unemployment benefits is an unqualified good. But there is room for debate on whether focusing on the safety net nearly exclusively is harming the liberal project at large. At the New York Times, Thomas Edsall cribs substantially from a post by Roosevelt Institute Fellow Mike Konczal to argue that doubling down on the ""social safety net"" strategy actually detracts from the progressive agenda at large:
In practice, Konczal writes, the political left has abandoned its quest for deep structural reform — full employment and worker empowerment — and instead has “doubled-down” on the safety net strategy. The result, in his view, is “a kind of pity-charity liberal capitalism.”
Konczal’s poignant description of the problem goes a long way toward explaining the current struggles of the left. The question is whether there is an effective worker empowerment strategy at a time of globalization, offshoring and robotization.
Insofar as Democrats concentrate the bulk of their efforts on means-tested transfer programs (on the extension of long-term unemployment benefits, Medicaid and food stamps, for example), they leave the most needy and vulnerable to the vagaries of public opinion.
Survey data find that during hard times people become less altruistic and more inclined to see the poor as undeserving. They turn to the right, not the left, in periods of economic stress.

Edsall makes the case that business interests are more than happy to have the social safety net in place because the welfare state allows them to pay wages that would otherwise be completely inadequate while expecting government to pick up the tab and ensure that these workers have enough resources to prevent the fabric of society from fraying completely. Meanwhile, the current political debate is occurring between Democratic elites who support ""pity-charity liberalism"" despite the lack of a broader empowerment agenda, and a Republican Party infected with such a case of Social Darwinism that it seems to want to see the poor starve, seemingly out of spite if nothing else.
Edsall concludes:
The call of Konczal and his colleagues on the progressive left for an empowerment agenda — for structural economic reform — faces roadblocks far higher than many people realize. The loss of a political movement (economic liberalism) and its political vehicle (a stable progressive coalition) has put the left into a position of retreat, struggling to protect besieged programs that are designed explicitly for the poor and that therefore lack strong public backing.
The shift of the Democratic Party from economic to “pity-charity” liberalism has put the entire liberal project in danger. It has increased its vulnerability to conservative challenge and left it without a base of politically mobilized supporters. Progressives are now dependent on the fragile possibility that inequality and socioeconomic immobility will push the social order to the breaking point and force the political system to respond.

Now, none of this is to argue that Democrats and progressive allies should not continue to fight tooth and nail for extensions of the social safety net. Obviously, common decency, economic justice, and the maintenance of the social fabric depend on the continuance of these programs. But especially now that Republicans have been using their control of the House of Representatives to chip away at the social safety net at every opportunity, playing defense is not enough. It is critical to go on offense and fight for a broader empowerment agenda and fundamental structural economic reform, rather than continue to simply defend the social safety net while austerity and economic inequality force ever-increasing numbers of people to rely on it.
Edsall is correct that the political power of the bottom half of the economic spectrum has been gutted and hollowed out; that we have lost a political movement and a political vehicle at the nationwide level. At the local level, however, there are signs of coalescence as minimum wage increases take hold across the country, and as fast food strikes spring up organically across the country. And in Senator Elizabeth Warren, we have one nationwide leader who is willing to not just defend the social safety net, but put fundamental economic reform at the top of her agenda.
The progressive movement is starting to see the energy and leadership necessary to stop simply playing defense, and start advocating for an empowerment agenda that can reverse the decades of squeezing and fracturing endured by the middle class. The question is whether we can sustain enough organizational strength to capitalize at both the local and the federal level and bring about the type of fundamental economic change we need.

There has already been another election discrediting the Republican opponent and beating him by a landslide, but Sarah Palin is still reliving the McCain/Palin 2008 failed campaign.
There is still a little corner of the media living in a little world of their own creation. According to them it's the only place left where the truth is being told.

America is realizing that these outlets provide nothing but Democrat-approved propaganda, and are turning to other sources for information.
In fact they have even discovered search engines and Google.
Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Friday that the McCain campaign in 2008 prevented her from talking about Barack Obama's controversial background or his lack of job experience for fear ""the media would eat us alive.""
So it's a good thing that there's one place left (on Fox at 10 o'clock at night) where America can still get some truth. She has to speak out now, because: Americans Must Know The Truth!
In the campaign -- Greta, this is important for Americans to understand -- I was not allowed to talk about things like that because those elitists, those who are the brainiacs in the GOP machine running John McCain's campaign at the time, said that the media would eat us alive if we brought up these things.
Of course McCain was absolutely right in how target rich Sarah Palin was for the 'lamestream' media.



She then held up her 'redneck version' of Karl Rove's whiteboard (a piece of paper) showing the Obama Scandals:

Because writing them down somehow makes these 'scandals' worse.
That “self-censoring,” Palin said, meant a campaign where “we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who the candidate was, Barack Obama.”
And what did the McCain brainiacs' silencing of her attempts to speak the truth about Obama get us? Things like reminding us about the 57 states gaffe? (The irony of Gaffemaster Palin bringing up this incident is rich).
“What that got us, this kind of complacency and self-censoring of a campaign where we weren’t allowed to tell the truth about who this candidate was – Barack Obama – what it got us was a list of these scandals,” Palin said.
It got us scandals! Scandals I tellz ya!
Palin held up a white piece of paper she dubbed “the redneck version of a whiteboard,” on which she had scrawled the titles of numerous Obama administration scandals – including Fast & Furious, Benghazi and IRS targeting.




So it's all John McCain and his brainiacs fault. If Sarah Palin had just been allowed to speak the truth, if only Americans knew Barack Obama had visited Bill Ayers in 57 states, she and McCain could have won that election!
Probably the one right thing John McCain did after the historic error of selecting Sarah Palin, half-term governor of Alaska, as his running mate was muzzling her immediately. She most likely was told not to talk about anything at all really. Thank you once again John McCain for giving us Sarah Palin in 2008, and thus Barack Obama.

I wish I could properly convey how freakin' sick and tired I am listening to both cable news and broadcast news force feed us the Republican line of bullshit du jour. It's either a case of institutionalized duplicitousness, corporate coercion -- or -- pure, unadulterated laziness. I mean, out of the hundreds of so-called 'journalists' out there in mendacious media land, would it have killed one of them to actually read the May 14th draft report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration?
Facts matter Dammit! And media reports regarding the IRS 'scandal' are sorely void of them. I'm taking about real facts. Not tea party 'facts'. Not conservative dogmatic 'truthiness'. Not partisan spin. Honest, verifiable facts!

First, the facts we know
Some of the flagged groups did have their tax-exempt status delayed or did face some additional scrutiny, but not a single group has been denied tax-exempt status.
A May 14 draft report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that none of the 296 questionable applicants had been denied, “For the 296 potential political cases we reviewed, as of December 17, 2012, 108 applications had been approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been denied, and 160 cases were open from 206 to 1,138 calendar days (some crossing two election cycles).” (p. 14)
In fact, the only known 501(c)(4) applicant to recently have its status denied happens to be a progressive group: the Maine chapter of Emerge America, which trains Democratic women to run for office. Although the group did no electoral work, and didn’t participate in independent expenditure campaign activity either, its partisan nature disqualified it from being categorized as working for the “common good.”

According to the IG's report roughly 31% of applications (91 out of 296) reviewed did not have...
""... indications of significant political campaign intervention.""
So, a little more than 2/3rds of applications flagged for processing by specialists were indeed politically-oriented.
Normally, the aforementioned category would disqualify applicants for 501(C)(4) status. But the sheer volume of applicants during and after the 2008 presidential election along with the polarization of the political process in general combined to inhibit the agency's screening ability, allowing those groups to obtain the highly-sought-after 501(C)(4) tax-exempt status. Yes, it's an excuse. It was a bureaucratic failure with ""bureaucratic"" being the operative term.
But, it wasn't Barack Obama's army of liberal zombies.  


But all told, a critical look at some of the activities of those tea party applicants currently under review by IREHR or those already designated as 501(C)(4) reveals the potential for a threat to democratic governance in general.
From the IREHR website: The Tea Party and the IRS “Scandal” The Actual Facts of the Case
Here are the not-so-known facts of a few of those cases:
• The First Coast Tea Party Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida, for example, which applied for 501(c)(4) status in 2009 and received it in 2011. Commenting about the recent IRS controversy on Facebook, the group declared “We file a tax return, account for every penny.. We do not endorse candidates that is a no no.” Yet the group’s activities included public bragging about directly helping Republican campaigns. In an August 30, 2012 Facebook post, for instance, the group advertised a Jacksonville rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, adding, “bring your chairs and your signs, make sure they know that the First Coast Tea Party is and has been helping their campaign.”
It must be noted here that three weeks after receiving 501(C)(4) status the group declared a ""state of emergency"" on their Facebook page, pleading with supporters to campaign for Romney.
THIS is just one example of why the IRS wanted all their Facebook postings.
“FLORIDA FRIENDS, IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF THESE 3 COUNTIES GET OFF THE COUCH NOW, GET YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE COUCH. GET TO THE REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS AND OFFER AND THEN DO SOME WORK. PHONES, (YOU CAN EVEN DO THESE CALLS FROM HOME) AND WALK AND KNOCK. NOW. WE CANNOT LOSE FLORIDA TO OBAMA.. NOW. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL.” [Emphasis in Original]
That plea came from the official Face book account of the organization as opposed to coming from random supporters.
• Similarly, the Louisville Tea Party was granted 501(c)(4) status in 2009.  Nevertheless, it published a list of “officially tea party endorsed candidates for the 2011 Kentucky primary.” They also published an article “The Rationale for Romney-Ryan,” arguing for Tea Partiers to vote for the Republican candidate.
Then there’s...
• The Katy Tea Party Patriots, which filed for 501(c)(4) non-profit status in 2009. This group actually ran an “Oust Obama 2012” campaign, organizing block-watching with the Fort Bend GOP, and phone-banking against Obama at GOP headquarters in Sugarland and Houston, Texas. Still featured on the frontpage of the group’s website at the time this article was written is an October 4, 2012 article entitled, “Our Country's Future” by Katy Tea Party Patriots President, Darcy Kahrhoff. She urged members to vote for Gov. Romney. ""Please take time to talk with friends and family you may have living out of state, and try to convince them to vote for Governor Romney, especially if you have friends and family in Florida, Colorado, or Ohio. Also, find a Senatorial candidate to support in these states, and go to FreedomWorks to phone bank for these patriots.  Everything you can do to help will matter.  We can, and we must, win this!""
Not to be outdone...
• The Central Valley Tea Party Inc. This regional California Tea Party group was granted the much more politically limiting IRS 501(c)(3) tax status back in 2009.  It should be noted that this tax-status explicitly prohibits partisan political activity. According the IRS, “Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. The prohibition applies to all campaigns including campaigns at the federal, state and local level.  Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.”
Despite this (c)(3) designation, the front-page of the group's website features ""upcoming events"" instructing members to ""Volunteer for Measure G,"" and ""Volunteer for Vidak for Senate.” In the latter case, the website simply tells members...
""Please volunteer to do phone banking or precinct walking to help win the election.""
In an article in the October 2012 issue of the Central Valley Tea Party Times entitled, ""Why You Should Be Excited to Vote for Mitt Romney,"" Paul Szopa told fellow Central Valley Tea Partiers to get out and campaign for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney,
""So it’s time to get excited to vote for the better candidate. It’s time to talk him up to friends and family. It’s time to join with groups like Operation Swing State (www.operationswingstate.org) and make calls in support of his candidacy.""
Another Tea Party group granted the 501(c)(3) non-profit status by the IRS...
• The Tifton, Georgia-based Tiftarea Tea Party Patriots, Inc., which received the designation in 2010. The group also appears to have engaged in openly political activity, including publicly endorsing candidates. On October 9, 2012, in a post on the group’s website “Are you ready to vote?” the group offered up an endorsement for Romney, “The choice is simple. Obama has stated, He will transform America and acted to do such.  Everything this Administration stands for, is Government and control of every aspect of life.  This is the pipe dream of a Socialist’s mentality, for in their eyes, you the individual, do not know and cannot do, what is right, so someone else has to make decisions for you, to ensure, you do not make the wrong choices or actions. Or you chose Romney, who does not want to transform America, the greatest nation in history of human kind.  He wants to allow, the individual, to have the right, to succeed and fail on his own regard, while ensuring those freedoms, given by our Creator and to assure those inalienable rights, written about in the Declaration of Independence are retained by their proper owners, ‘We the People.’”
Note these are only a few of the many examples of blatant political involvement by tea party 'non-profits' reviewed by IREHR. Of course, there are plenty more. As the title of this diary indicates, the REAL scandal here is how often the IRS granted 501(C)(4) status to groups that egregiously violated standards.
Even though the agency was clearly inundated with applications there's no excuse for the incompetency of its employees. As far as I know the agency was at full strength; no cutbacks, no furloughs... just incompetency.
Now, one must ask:
After the firing of several high level IRS employees over this incident, how likely is it that Tea Party groups will be prevented these sorts of violations in the future?
I don't know if we want to know the answer to that question.
Here's an article written for Salon.com by Joan Walsh highlighting what appears to be one of the few groups denied 501(C)(4) status -- a Democratic group.

Add Erik Rush to the list of prominent wingnuts calling for a coup against Obama.  The WorldNutDaily columnist and frequent Faux News guest is out with a new column that calls for Obama to be overthrown ""by any means necessary""--even if they aren't legal.
I have said previously that if a preponderance of Americans suddenly became aware of what I and a few others know (not “believe,” but know), they would stream into our nation’s capital by the millions, concern for personal safety cast aside in light of that which is at stake. They would demand the resignation of those in this administration, as well as many who have facilitated its crimes. Seeing this, these ruling class elites would have no choice but to retreat – or to attempt to forcibly quell the movement. Such action at that point would undoubtedly fail, given the determination of so large and motivated a host.
This administration, much of the Congress, and the creatures who  support the same in blissful, belligerent ignorance must be neutralized if this nation is to survive in any semblance of its intended form. And it must be done by any means necessary, because such criminals have proven that they are not dissuaded by trifles like legality.  The law, in our President’s estimation, is what he says it is. This has been proven time and again.
So Obama and his cabal, and in all likelihood a substantial segment of Congress must go. We must also extricate the radicals and Islamists whom Obama has so kindly insinuated into high places in our government. And the culture of our government must change. Indeed, it will take some time and sacrifice, but America has never faced a threat such as this. In truth, I don’t think any nation has.

Rush maintains that nothing short of a coup is necessary to pull the country from ""the brink of totalitarianism.""  The best that can be said about this sentiment is that Rush is blind in his right eye.  After all, we now know that a substantial element of the GOP deliberately planned to defund Obamacare knowing full well it would cause a shutdown.  Tell me how that isn't undemocratic.
Moreover, Rush is the last person to wring his hands about authoritarian excess.  Before the 2012 election, he claimed that the first priority for a Romney administration should have been to arrest Democrats and journalists for treason--a claim that he reiterated back in July.  In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, he called for all Muslims to be lined up and shot.
I really have to wonder--what does it say about Faux News and WorldNutDaily that this guy is still associated with them?


 3:21 PM PT: Since this made the rec list, I thought I'd mention that Rush was kind enough to enable Facebook for comments.  Head over there and let him have it.

This week, the Daily Beast contacted and harassed private citizens who made contributions to Sarah Palin’s political action committee, SarahPAC. In doing so, the outlet attempted to also weaken her organization by smearing it in the eyes of those most responsible for ensuring Palin’s free-market populist message and conservatism is widely disseminated. 
During the first half of 2013, a political off-year in which there are few elections, Palin’s political action committee spent $35,000 more than it took in. The Daily Beast seized on that number and tried to convince donors to SarahPAC that Palin was defrauding them by spending money on expenses common to every political action committee.
As the Daily Beast conceded, Palin’s donors were not buying the Beast’s malarkey. 
Tim Crawford, the treasurer of SarahPAC, told Breitbart News that since 2013 is an off-year, the organization did not aggressively raise money, cognizant of the fact conservative donors were flooded with requests during the 2012 election cycle. 
“For the most part we gave our donors a break and didn’t fundraise aggressively at all. Very pleased with the results,” Crawford told Breitbart News. “It is an off year after a presidential election where every donor was bombarded with requests.”
As the Daily Beast mentioned, Palin’s PAC did make a $5,000 contribution to Jason Smith; the conservative Republican won a special election in Missouri’s Eighth Congressional District in June by a hefty margin, 67% to 27%. 
John Avlon, the co-founder of the anti-Tea Party “No Labels” group, was recently promoted to be the “Executive Editor” of the Daily Beast. Avlon oversees a publication that declared the Tea Party was dead earlier this year before conceding less than six months later that the movement has roared back to life. 
“No Labels” donors want to see the Tea Party destroyed, and Avlon’s group benefits financially and politically if the Tea Party and conservatives are weakened. Palin, coincidentally, is the political figure who former South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said had the most impact in Republican primaries. Furthermore, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) declared at this year’s CPAC that he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin’s support in the Texas Republican Senate primary. 
Showing Palin’s strong grassroots support, the Daily Beast acknowledges that 75% of SarahPAC’s donations are from “small donors” who contribute less than $200. The Daily Beast admitted they reached out to a “number” of donors and got three on record, all of whom dismissed the outlet’s assertion that SarahPAC was wasting their money. 
One donor said, “I trust her judgment and her record.” Another said she has “done research” on Palin’s advisers and the ones that she uses are the “good” ones. Another donor mocked the Daily Beast for insinuating Palin was wasting their money, simply telling the reporter, “Come on, get real.”
The publication seems troubled that Palin, a figure whose star power is surpassed by few in American politics, paid North Star Strategies’s Jason Recher to organize and accompany Palin to events to ensure they went smoothly. To the Daily Beast’s surprise, Palin also has advisers, like Rebecca Mansour–who is mentioned in the piece–that are indispensable to any political figure, especially those like Palin whose time is in demanded like few others. 
Breitbart News has already systematically undercut Avlon’s assertion that Palin was being hypocritical for railing against Washington’s permanent political class while having political advisers who fight against it. Palin’s advisers are different, as Breitbart News reported:
They don’t hang “for sale” signs around their necks every election cycle to field a slate of candidates to butter their breads. They don’t go on television shows while not disclosing their business interests or allegiances when attacking other candidates. In fact, it is difficult to even think of the last time a Palin staff member actually went on a television program. Again, it is because these are people who work for Palin, are assembled for the long run, and put Palin’s interests ahead of their own. They don’t have a stable or roster of clients. 
In closing, the Daily Beast criticized Palin’s PAC for spending money on hotel rooms so that Palin could give a “commencement speech in the tiny town of Republic, Washington.” As Breitbart News reported, Palin gave that speech in a town elitist New York outlets like the Daily Beast so often dismiss, deride, and ignore.
The Daily Beast criticized Palin for paying her way–and not forgetting her roots–to speak at the high school graduation in Republic, Washington. Perhaps the outlet expected her to walk or drive to give that address. More disturbingly, though, the outlet harassed and pestered private citizens who donated to her political organization, trying to turn them off from supporting a political figure and organization that runs counter to the one co-founded by the Daily Beast’s Executive Editor. 
That is the type of permanent-political-class politics that Palin and her political action committee have always fought. "

Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals, reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016, but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.
Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so, they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.
Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition, and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions, even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist, as well, famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008, claiming he would have voted differently.
In truth, there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem, for example, and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).
Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure, a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public, even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel, and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.
Yet the two have avoided accountability, since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it), and now that the election is long gone, most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words, and those four dead Americans, for the rest of her career; chances are, however, that she will not.
Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president, as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes, not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.
President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate, through Clinton, in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short, that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves, and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance."

Tamara Keith of National Public Radio filed a story Tuesday on efforts by liberal non-profit groups to claim that they, too, were “targeted” by the IRS, just as conservative groups were. None of them, however, can claim that they were singled out because of their names or views–and many received approval before the 2012 election.
Keith notes that several “progressive” groups received extensive inquiries from the IRS when they applied for 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 status, including intrusive questions about their donors. Some complain that approval took nearly two years. Keith draws parallels between their experience and that of conservative groups.
But Keith notes that “everyone” agrees that what happened to groups with “Tea Party” and “Patriot” in their names was wrong–and could well have added that there are no parallels to some of the worst abuses that conservative groups endured, such as questions about the content of their prayers, or leaks of donor lists.
Keith’s report amplifies one of two narratives Democrats and the left have been spinning in the past several weeks to deflate the IRS scandal. One is that the IRS ought to be investigating political non-profit groups; the other, somewhat conflicting story is that the abuse conservative groups experienced was not unique.
The story was released on the day that Tea Party groups are gathering for an “Audit the IRS” rally in Washington to protest the agency’s conduct. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee continues its investigation of the IRS, as legislators debate calls for a special prosecutor into the scandal.
Update: As Breitbart News’ Mike Flynn has noted, Democrats did not call any liberal non-profit groups to testify before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month when several of the Tea Party and conservative groups that had been targeted spoke to legislators about their experience of abuses by the IRS.

If we thought Jim Vandehei's and Mike Allen's piece of Politico schmuck pom-poming how DC establishment had turned against the Obama Administration, was bad enough, just read Charlie Cook's latest article. He outright tells GOP ""[a]s a tactical matter, a subterranean campaign will score more direct hits on the president."" Anyone who still thought there is a shred of integrity anywhere left in our corporate media, should erase that from their mind.
Charlie Cook of The National Journal, pollster and apparatchik of the furrow-browed serious journos wrote this in May18th issue of The National Journal:
Republicans would be much wiser to pursue a third option: Dig up as much damaging information as they can about the Obama administration and leak it to reporters they know will write tough stories that won’t be traced back to the source. That way, the public won’t see the GOP as being obsessed with attacking the other side and playing gotcha at the expense of the big issues facing the country—the ones voters really care about.
Meanwhile, everyone in Washington will watch polls for signs of blood in the water, indications that the controversies or scandals—depending upon your perspective—are taking a political toll on Obama’s job-approval numbers.

So the job description for our journos is to catalyze bloodsports. It's not new, but now it's brazen. They don't care if their bias is blatant...



In the article titled Don't Gloat, Leak Charlie Cook tells Republicans how to hide their ""schadenfreude"" by getting reporters who write ""tough stories"" to do their dirty work for them bloodying President Obama up.
But as much as congressional Republicans are enjoying their schadenfreude, they would be well advised to think long and hard about their next steps. Even the most cursory look at opinion polls or focus groups reveals that the public is convinced we have an ineffectual and out-of-touch Congress that spends too much time backbiting, grandstanding, and Monday-morning quarterbacking while the country’s problems fester. Arguably, showboating for the cameras and holding hearings are what Congress does best; the temptation is unavoidable.
This is coming from same guy who on May 14th wrote a piece titled While Republicans Rant about Benghazi and IRS, Public Mostly Yawns"" indicating that poll numbers are showing the faux scandals to be having zero impact on President Obama.
Well, a journalist-pollster with integrity would leave the story at that, right? But no. In this day and age there is no such thing as simply reporting facts and leaving them be. Charlie Cook dispenses this ""advise"" to GOP for no other stated reason than to brign President Obama's poll numbers down just so history can be repeated.
If the facts don't fit your narrative, why, gin up your own ""facts""!!
The lowest week of Gallup polling thus far for Obama was 40 percent, occurring in August and October of 2011. Arguably, he is due for a dip, given that each of his modern predecessors has dropped into the 30s or below. Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton each hit a low point of 37 percent. President George W. Bush’s low ebb was 31 percent; Nixon’s was 27 percent; Carter’s was 28 percent; and George H.W. Bush’s was 29 percent.
Charlie Cook is after all twiddling his thumbs waiting to see which ""scandals"" real or ginned up ""takes on legs"" because ""History says something always happens in the second term.""
Well, in Charlie Cook's warped mind that ""something"" can only be negative which must be induced to occur if it doesn't do so naturally. Yeah...
This is a more virulent version of the diatribe we heard last year in the run up to the 2012 elections, No President has been re-elected with Unemployment rates above 7%, then 8%, Enthusiasm gap, Obama 2008 coalition was a fluke, blah blah blah!
But reading that piece made me sick. As sequester takes it's horrible toll on many vulnerable people who've been rendered invisible; as GOP House votes to deny those same people access to healthcare (however imperfect it is); as the conservative movement rabidly tears our commonweal apart, our Journalists focus on meta, on inducing bloodsport so their little historical boxes can be ticked. Really, Charlie?...
This is the media cauldron within which Democrats are trying to govern these United States of America. PATHETIC!

by Alec Kohut
The video Maryland Democrat Chris Van Hollen’s recent “parliamentary inquiry” on the floor of the House of the Representatives is making the rounds, and will likely be seen by millions by the end of the week. I include this video at the bottom of the page.
The video puts to rest any argument that the GOP wants to end the shutdown and get government working again. Perhaps they are having too much fun waving confederate flags in front of the White House. The bill, H.R. 368, forbids anyone except “the Majority Leader or his designate” from bringing a clean continuing resolution to the floor for vote.
Now it doesn’t surprise me in the least that Republicans would do this. It doesn’t outrage me that the use of backhanded, undemocratic measures are being employed by the party controlled by Tea Party loons.
What does infuriate me is the fact the seven Democrats crossed party lines to vote for a resolution that gives Eric Cantor, and only Eric Cantor the ability to bring fourth a vote a clear CR to get the government working aging…and yes, open the monuments.
And now several of the seven House Democrats that voted for HR 368, are Tweeting and saying that they want a clean CR and are supporting the discharge petition. But I’m not falling for it. These seven members willfully voted against democracy, and supported the GOP’s effort to create yet another manufactured crisis.
The seven back-stabbing, turncoat, worthless Democrats are:
Ron Barber    AZ-2
John Barrow   GA-12
Dan Maffei   NY-24
Sean Patrick Maloney   NY-18
Jim Matheson   UT-4
Mike McIntyre   NC-7   
Collin Peterson   MN-7   
Here’s what some of these dishonest Reps. have been Tweeting:



These are examples back-stabbing Democrats who side with the Tea Party when they think we’re not watching, then want us honest Democrats to believe them in wanting the shutdown to end.
Words are not capable of expressing my outrage and pure contempt for these low-life, scumbag traitors in our party.
Thank you Chris Van Hollen for pulling back the curtain and exposing these truly worthless Democrats!

46,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/18/Universal-Background-Checks-Equal-Universal-Gun-Control,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Universal Background Checks Equal Universal Gun Control,"
As an “assault weapons” ban seems less likely to even make it to a floor vote, President Obama and Democrat lawmakers are increasingly looking to universal background checks as the piece of legislation they can push through the House and Senate.
Here’s the problem: Universal background checks are the most insidious of all the gun control measures pushed heretofore. They will rob of us of more freedom than an “assault weapons” ban and a “high capacity” magazine ban combined, all in the name of preventing another Sandy Hook shooting. Yet they will actually do nothing to prevent such a shooting. Nothing at all. 
As David Kopel so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable. 
Put simply, this means that once a universal background state statute is in place, the government will require you to register every gun you own–shotguns, rifles, and handguns–so that they can be sure you do not sell a gun privately. 
Which brings us to our second point: universal background checks will end private sales, period. No more sales to neighbors, no more sales between a father and his son or a mother and her daughter. No more sales between friends. 
Once guns are registered, and private sales have been ended, the door will be opened for taxes allocated per number of guns owned, forced liability insurance payable based on number of guns owned, and for outright gun confiscation. 
The NRA has warned about the confiscation that usually follows registration, historically speaking, and the Democrats themselves are already promoting per-gun taxes and liability insurance. 
The bottom line: Universal background checks represent the crest of the hill atop the slippery slope. We must contact our Reps. and Sens. and demand that they say no to this insidious gun control measure.
It has nothing to with Sandy Hook Elementary, but everything to do with helping Democrats realize their dreams of crushing the 2nd Amendment. "

Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart spent last week mocking the GOP for opposing Obamacare, ignoring legitimate concerns Republicans raised about both the health care legislation itself and its bungled launch.
Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.
Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show, and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.
Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.
We’re going to do a challenge,” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.
Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.
Stewart wasn’t finished.
If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare], it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to,” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year, but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.”
Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups, prompting Stewart to say, “Am I a stupid man?
No, just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.
Sadly, many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true, Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night.

Dozens of times (that we know of) over his campaign to pass ObamaCare and to win re-election, President Obama lied to the American people about being able to keep the health insurance they like. But that lie has only been replaced with another: the lie that these cancellations will be limited to the 5% of Americans in the individual marketplace — when the truth is that these cancellations have only just begun.
Over at National Review, in a piece appropriately titled “Lying About Lies,” Michael Tanner reports that the same ObamaCare formula currently wiping out the individual market is about to rain hell on the employer-based market. The result will be that tens of millions of policies will be wiped out. 
This is a secret that is and always has been hiding in plain sight. 
As far back as last March, the media dutifully reported that the CBO reported that these cancellations were coming. So the media knew Obama was lying during the campaign but never said a word to spread this truth — oh, except to call Mitt Romney a liar for telling the truth. 
All these Democrats and members of the elite media now pretending they don’t or didn’t know… Please. 
Just as the media knew Obama was lying about people in the individual market being able to keep their insurance, the media also know that the same apocalypse looms for the employer-based market. It is not conservatives making this estimate, it is the Congressional Budget Office. [emphasis mine]
But the same conditions that are causing the cancellation of individual policies will eventually result in the cancellation of millions of employment-based policies as well. The only reason that hasn’t happened yet is that the employer mandate was postponed for a year, so employer plans don’t yet have to be ACA-compliant. But they will. Even the Congressional Budget Office estimates that as many as 20 million workers will lose their current employer-sponsored plans. Combine that with those losing individual plans, and more than 30 million Americans cannot keep their current insurance.
ObamaCare’s latest trick is the “junk plan hustle.” Over and over, we keep hearing about how our White House overlords are doing Americans a favor by canceling the insurance they like and replacing it with “appropriate” health plans. But most of those plans are not junk plans. That is just another lie the White House is telling, and the media are letting them get away with it. 
The media know the White House is lying about this junk plan nonsense because the ObamaCare guidelines for what isn’t a “junk plan” only includes 2% of the policies currently in existence. 
According to HealthPocket, a health-insurance consulting firm, fewer than 2 percent of individual plans on offer today meet all ACA requirements. The most frequent reason for noncompliance was not a failure to cover hospitalization, as the administration has suggested, but not providing pediatric care, including vision and dental care for children. A worthwhile benefit, perhaps, but if you are childless, it’s hard to see how lacking such a benefit makes your policy subpar.
This is why other serious think tanks believe that before this nightmare is over, up to 93 million people could lose the insurance Obama promised they could keep. 
In order to buy time, Obama, Democrats, and the media are trying to con the American people into believing that the rolling ObamaCare catastrophe is compartmentalized to just 5% of the population. This conspiracy of silence is all about trying to contain through a lie of omission what is a legitimate reason for the public to panic as soon as they realize that … they are next. 
Obama is not sorry for lying. And the media are not sorry for covering up that lie for three years. 
The phase we are in now is nothing more than a 2.0 version of that exact same lie.

More and more Americans are beginning to realize that they were sold Obamacare on false pretenses. What they are getting in the mail isn’t what they ordered. 
Those responsible for saddling the country with this law, including the law’s chief salesman, President Obama, are scrambling to dodge the hammer of growing public resentment over the bill of goods that they have sold the American people. They are coming up with “fixes”, but I caution the buyer, beware. 
The president, along with members of his party who are facing elections soon, are busy campaigning for proposals they say do what these architects of the law promised in the first place. But folks should think carefully about relying on the same people who repeatedly promised one thing and delivered something far different. Consumers who liked their health care plans are being forced to give them up. People who were told they would pay less for health care will be paying more. Even fans of Obamacare are upset with an archaic, ready-fire-aim website that took years and millions of dollars to develop, but, to put it mildly, is failing miserably. Will Americans again put their faith in the leaders who said the law had to be passed before it was understood? They shouldn’t.
In 2010 on the Senate floor, I warned that rules published in the Federal Register would guarantee that people who liked their health care would lose it. I warned that health care costs would go up. I warned that employers would be forced to cut back worker hours and jobs. I did more than warn this would happen, I offered senators a chance to prevent these calamities. Proponents of Obamacare rejected and ridiculed my legislation. 
These same folks now, fighting for their political lives, are offering patches for their program and excuses for why it isn’t working. However, these folks are the same people who created the problems in the first place. They simply don’t want you to be able to choose the health insurance you want unless it’s health insurance they think you should have. They never did. Their plan was and is for policy makers in Washington to make what the experts believe are the best choices for you. 
The Washington Post reported recently that the president said his administration could not in good faith allow people with inferior insurance plans to keep them. That’s not what he said dozens of times before the law passed and it doesn’t sound like a person ready to fix a problem. This isn’t about a fumbled roll-out or a computer glitch. This law’s problems are inherent within it. The way to get our country out of this bad situation is with the earnest help of people who recognize the benefit of individuals being able to make their own choices. 
I’m a cosponsor of Senator Ron Johnson’s (R-Wis.) “If You Like Your Health Plan, You Can Keep it Act”. The House passed a bill that would allow insurers to continue offering policies that don’t meet the expensive Obamacare mandates. So far we haven’t received much positive feedback from the president or majority in the Senate. Instead, the president announced another exception to a law that is already riddled with them, while the Senate majority proposes more federal mandates to “fix” the mandates they already have imposed on America. But as the Wall Street Journal has pointed out, there is a real difference between letting people keep their plans by unshackling them from federal rules and working with state frameworks versus forcing insurers to comply with more new requirements.
My dad used to say that if you keep on doing what you’ve been doing you are going to end up with what you’ve got. I’ve heard the Senate majority leader say the definition of insanity is continuing to do the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Unless people demand a new approach to health care — bona-fide inclusion of ideas from those who want a new approach — then we’re going to end up with what we have now: broken promises. We can do better."

I love a defunding fight as much as anyone, but I really want to see ObamaCare get a stake through its heart via widespread civil disobedience. If people refuse to sign up for ObamaCare, the program collapses. Nothing would be more satisfying than to see ObamaCare go the way of Prohibition (without the violence): as something else that pushed the wonderfully unruly American people too far. 
Contrary to what the media are telling you, the shutdown is not helping ObamaCare. Again and again, conservatives have been taunted by the media with the cry of, “If you hadn’t shut down the government, we’d be covering the ObamaCare launch debacle.”
Huh? 
The media are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle, and the coverage is the Obama administration’s worst nightmare because the shutdown has made it impossible for the White House to come up with a plan that would instruct the media in how to mitigate the damage. 
You see, if there was no shutdown, the media coverage of the launch would not be anywhere as negative for the White House as it is now, and here is why…
1. The White House Can’t Do Damage Control – Right now the media and the White House are covering the ObamaCare launch debacle in stark, one-dimensional terms: It is an expensive, disappointing, big government  debacle. Both are too overwhelmed to figure out a way to make it look less worse, which we all know would happen if they had the time and resources. 
2. The White House Can’t Gameplan a Plan B – While the administration obviously bungled the launch, when it comes to cleaning up a mess, this White House can usually move pretty fast. This time the White House can’t. They and the media are too bogged down in the shutdown. With some breathing room, the White House might have been able to set up a massive call center staffed with volunteers — something, anything to get people signed up. But even if they do, there is just no media space available to spread the word. 
3. White House Can’t Reassure Anyone – If the shutdown wasn’t gobbling up White House resources and media space, the administration could fan out its supporters to reassure those interested in signing up for ObamaCare that things are going to get better and that the problems are aggressively being worked on. Instead, all potential enrollees are seeing is error messages and all they are hearing is bad news. 
4. White House Can’t Spin the Sticker Shock – If anything brings down ObamaCare, it will be sticker shock. For four years, Obama, Democrats, and the media have been lying to the American people about the cost of ObamaCare. On top of adding $2.6 trillion to our deficit, individuals are facing shockingly high premiums and premium increases. This, after being lied to again and again about cheaper premiums. I’m not sure how the White House and its media would spin their way out of this, but heaven knows if they had the time and resources, they would find a way. After all, this is the same media that turned Obama’s Libya debacle into a campaign problem for Mitt Romney. 
—
The bottom line to ObamaCare’s success or failure is the number of enrollees paying into the system. In its first year, ObamaCare needs seven million enrollees, three million of them healthy and under age 35. 
If those numbers aren’t met, the program is a failure, the disapproval ratings increase, and the chances of ObamaCare slowly being killed increase. 
ObamaCare is the president’s baby, his only significant accomplishment, his only hope for a legacy — it is burning down before his eyes and he is helpless to do anything to shape the all-important first impression. 
Throughout Obama’s time in the spotlight, this is the only time I have ever witnessed anything he has bungled receiving only harshly negative coverage. It’s a bloodbath because the shutdown is taking up all the space that would normally be used for spin and lies.

The Obama administration decided that Obamacare Navigators, tasked with helping Americans enroll in a health insurance plan, would not undergo mandatory background checks. Now, in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov, the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk. 
Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report, titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers, concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators. 
The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges, violated HHS rules and procedures, and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover, this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.
On November 21, the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen, the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and Mandy Cohen, Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.
The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information, such as one’s social security number, yearly income, and other sensitive tax information,” the report found.
The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course, and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant, violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.” 
For instance, the Committee found:
The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures, but rather from news reports. 
Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators, but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.
The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse, notes from an October 11, 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”
The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks, since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name, social security number, the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household, and income for every member of the household.”
The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen, the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators, previously stated, “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator,” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income. 
Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future,” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise. 
Navigators, the report also found, “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”
And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators, which, as of mid-November, numbered 2,500 individuals,” the list is private, which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator,” the committee found.

Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment, a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program. 
Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium,” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat, whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer, Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for. 
The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted, not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally, they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700,000 to one million. 
Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.” 
Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”
“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica. 
Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance, including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance, analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers, especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.
Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March. 
According to the latest CNN poll, support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%. 
Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years."
53,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/20/Obamacare-Individual-Mandate-Fix-is-Illegal-Again,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Obama Illegaly Delays Obamacare Individual Mandate for Some,"

President Barack Obama has illegally suspended the single most important provision of Obamacare, the infamous Individual Mandate, for some Americans. 
On Dec. 19, the president declared a change to the Individual Mandate, a provision that led to the first lawsuit in American history where a majority of the states in this nation (26 out of 50) sued the federal government over the constitutionality of a federal law, resulting in a historic Supreme Court decision that conservative lawyers and scholars roundly condemn insofar as it upheld the Individual Mandate as a massive tax by a 5-4 vote.
The Obama administration’s disastrous rollout of Obamacare has been a textbook illustration of the manifest incompetence of government to run the American healthcare system, from the humiliating website difficulties to the eye-popping costs of skyrocketing monthly insurance premiums and deductibles. The White House explains that it would be unfair under these circumstances to penalize Americans who attempt to obtain insurance through the Obamacare exchanges but are unable to do so.
Therefore the president has declared a “hardship exemption” for Americans encountering those difficulties. There will be a grace period for at least part of 2014. The White House has not specified a firm date of when this exemption will definitely end, or how they will be able to distinguish with certainty people who earnestly tried to obtain insurance versus those who are gaming the system.
But this exemption, like those that came before it, is illegal. The language of ACA’s Section 1501 is to impose a truly-mandatory Individual Mandate. Conservatives insist that even if all the provisions in the ACA are applied, the system will not work financially. But even liberals admit that if the Individual Mandate is not in force, then you do not bring in enough revenue from young, healthy adults to pay for the staggering cost of the massive new entitlements and programs that the ACA creates. Without the Individual Mandate, you get a “death spiral” of growing deficits that will render health insurance companies insolvent and deprive healthcare providers of payment for their life-saving treatments.

In Section 1513 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Employer Mandate (the requirement for companies employing 50+ people) specifies that this requirement for employers to offer insurance goes into effect Jan. 1, 2014. When Obama announced over the summer that he was suspending that requirement until 2015, he said he has the power to “tweak” a law so long as that tweaking “doesn’t go to the essence of the law.”
That’s dead wrong under the U.S. Constitution. Ironically, it would not apply here anyway, since some of these provisions like the Individual Mandate and the Employer Mandate are two of the most important provisions of the entire ACA and are essential to the ACA’s core operations. However, even if they were insignificant provisions, the Constitution does not permit a president to change a single semicolon of a federal law by himself. 
Under Article I of the Constitution, every law must either pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the president, or if the president vetoes the bill instead of signing it, then it must pass the House and Senate a second time, by a two-thirds super-majority vote in each chamber. That is the only process by which federal law can be made. Everything else is illegal. 
Many laws authorize top administrative officials to develop regulations carrying the force of law to implement some provision in the law. Other laws contain provisions that empower executive-branch officials to suspend or modify certain legal requirements, usually for a fixed period of time and only after certain conditions are met, such as completing a study that discovers facts that are relevant to the law’s operations. This power is delegated by the terms of the statute, where the federal law-making body–Congress–votes to include such an option in a law. 
That is not the case with these parts of Obamacare. The changes in the law that President Obama has announced, such as telling insurers in Nov. 2013 that they could continue offering canceled policies, have been unilateral changes to mandatory terms in the federal law passed by Congress. These are provisions where Congress did not allow Obama or any of his Cabinet secretaries any discretion or options. They are requirements that bind the government and the private sector.
So not only is Obamacare bad policy, but now another aspect of this program is illegal.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama said of his health care law: “Despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it’s supposed to,” there are critics out there. He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House. 
Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23, 2010, the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented, because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it. 
Over the past three years, the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees, because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements, and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful, because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.) 
A year ago, the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states, making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care. 
Also a year ago, the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact, 34 states have refused to set up exchanges, and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.) 
Then two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014), the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees), and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above, this too is illegal.) 
And just this week, HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1, 2013, and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must. 
Yet with all that, Obama says that the ACA is working great, and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)
It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5, and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things, the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it, they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC, you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)
If any private citizen said such things, we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead, we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math,” or some other such softer statement. 
So using such a word would be disrespectful, and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House, there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.

55,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/12/Mike-Lee-on-GAI-Findings-Inexcusable-Unpardonable,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Mike Lee: Lack of Meetings Between Obama and Sebelius 'Inexcusable',"

On Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said it was “inexcusable” and “unpardonable” that President Barack Obama did not meet one-on-one with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare passed over three years ago. 
On Fox News’s Hannity, host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings. 
“Not to my knowledge,” Lee answered, before saying, “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.” 
Lee, who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul, continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”
At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings. 
The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly,” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday, which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record. 
When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday, though, he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.
The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”
According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”
Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.
“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday, with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.
Along the way, Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely, that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor, to those with pre-existing conditions, to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:
BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout, even though they had a couple years to plan for it? 
CUMMINGS: Yes, a bit surprised. But Wolf, what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue, but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option….
Keep in mind, Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times, trying to defund it, trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with, Wolf, on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care….
I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher. 
Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the IRS scandal. In every case, Cummings has tried to prevent oversight, not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration, and expresses some minimal outrage, but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare."

We're all now quite familiar with the reported claims by hundreds of people that they've received letters from their health insurance company that their plans have been ""Cancelled Due to ObamaCare"". We all know that this wasn't supposed to happen, that the President promised it wouldn't happen and even though many of these plans are only cancelled because they're essentially useless due to their exorbitant co-pays and deductibles that argument hasn't yet been entirely convincing. As I've previously diaried GOP Reps like Marsha Blackburn have gone ballistic arguing that ObamaCare has taken away people's ""freedom"" to buy the plan they want, even if it's cheap (and defective). Presidential Loser Mitt Romney was on Meet the Press this weekend haughtily proclaiming that the President Obama's Failure to the Tell The American People the Truth about the ACA is now rotting his Second Term. However, Talking Points Memo has a story up today that all of us need to see, bookmark and start forwarding to each and every media outlet that continues to claim that the ACA has ""Cancelled"" anyones Insurance Plan. Because it hasn't, that is A LIE - Obamacare didn't Cancel their plan. Plans that were in place since March of 2010 (prior to the Affordable Care Act)  were ""Grandfathered"" and excluded from many of the laws requirements so that they wouldn't be cancelled. ObamaCare doesn't FORCE those plans to remain, but it doesn't FORCE them to be cancelled either. TPM reports now that the Insurance Companies themselves have deliberately sent out these cancellation notices, along with automatic renewals into higher rate plans before Oct 1st as a means of preventing people from Shopping on the Exchange and finding better, cheaper plans. In short, this is all an Insurance Industry Scam to gouge their customers, blame Obamacare for it, and prevent them from taking advantage of improved coverage and savings that the ACA actually provides.


And so far, you have to admit, this Scam has worked beautifully. The White House has been rocked back on their heels not just by the rollout problems of HealthCare.gov (which is now actually working), but also by these Scammy ""Cancellation Letters"". But now the charlatans behind the curtain are finally being revealed.
Donna received the letter canceling her insurance plan on Sept. 16. Her insurance company, LifeWise of Washington, told her that they'd identified a new plan for her. If she did nothing, she'd be covered. A 56-year-old Seattle resident with a 57-year-old husband and 15-year-old daughter, Donna had been looking forward to the savings that the Affordable Care Act had to offer. But that's not what she found. Instead, she'd be paying an additional $300 a month for coverage. The letter made no mention of the health insurance marketplace that would soon open in Washington, where she could shop for competitive plans, and only an oblique reference to financial help that she might qualify for, if she made the effort to call and find out. Otherwise, she'd be automatically rolled over to a new plan -- and, as the letter said, ""If you're happy with this plan, do nothing."" If Donna had done nothing, she would have ended up spending about $1,000 more a month for insurance than she will now that she went to the marketplace, picked the best plan for her family and accessed tax credits at the heart of the health care reform law. ""The info that we were sent by LifeWise was totally bogus. Why the heck did they try to screw us?"" Donna said. ""People who are afraid of the ACA should be much more afraid of the insurance companies who will exploit their fear and end up overcharging them."" Donna is not alone.
No, she's not alone. It's not clear how widespread this practice has been, but some State insurance commissioners are starting to notice. In Kentucky, Insurance Provider Humana was fined $65,000 for sending out misleading letters.
The Kentucky Department of Insurance has fined Humana $65,430 because it offered policyholders an unapproved opportunity to amend their insurance as part of a letter that regulators have called “misleading.” The department investigated letters sent in August to 6,543 individual plan policyholders in Kentucky. The letters said they needed to renew their plans for 2014 within 30 days or choose a more expensive option that complies with the Affordable Care Act. But regulators last month called the letters misleading, arguing they did not make sufficiently clear that policyholders could compare and choose competing plans on the state’s health insurance exchanges, which open on Oct. 1, and for which they could be eligible for federal subsidies.
Let's follow this logically, if the letters were sent in August and required a response within 30 days - it essentially forced the policy holders to choose the worse possible option before the Oct 1st launch of their State Exchange. That is a classic ""High Pressure"" sales tactic. ""Buy NOW or you'll miss out. SALE ENDING SOON"" - when in fact, there was no legitimate reason to push people make a decision in that 30 day window other than to prevent them from shopping on the Exchange. Read the Human Letter. 2,200 people actually did respond within that 30 period, but Kentucy regulators after finding they had been deceived by Humana released them from that agreement and allowed them to go ahead and shop for a better plan on the marketplace. Then they fined Humana for their attempted Scam.
[Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon] Clark gave the example of a single mother with children who was urged to sign up for a Humana plan with a monthly premium of $719.86. That price is higher than any comparable plan for sale on the state's insurance marketplace, Clark said -- not to mention that the mother might have qualified for tax subsidies to help pay for it if she went through the marketplace, as Donna did.
So the next time you hear or read about how ObamaCare has caused someone to lose their inexpensive plan only to be forced to choose a much more expensive one. Don't Believe It. As Adm. Akbar would say: It's. A. Trap! Vyan

8:42 AM PT: To be fair, as VcLib pointed out in the comments not every plan was automatically Grandfathered.  There were these restrictions via https://www.healthcare.gov/....

All health plans must:
.End lifetime limits on coverage
.End arbitrary cancellations of health coverage
.Cover adult children up to age 26
.Provide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC), a short, easy-to-understand summary of what a plan covers and costs
.Hold insurance companies accountable to spend your premiums on health care, not administrative costs and bonuses
Grandfathered plans DON'T have to:
.Cover preventive care for free
.Guarantee your right to appeal
.Protect your choice of doctors and access to emergency care
.Be held accountable through Rate Review for excessive premium increases
In addition to the above, grandfathered individual health insurance plans (the kind you buy yourself, not the kind you get from an employer) don't have to:
.End yearly limits on coverage
.Cover you if you have a pre-existing health condition

So if you had a plan that had a lifetime cap, didn't cover your children until they were 26, could be arbitrarily cancelled and didn't spend 80-85% of your premiums on your care - that plan would have to be updated or replaced. If you had a plan like that, and for some reason liked it then you were always going to have to make an adjustment to a plan that doesn't suck anymore. The question is, would you be able to shop for the best possible option or would you stay with the options given by your current provider? These letters show that some providers tried to corral their clients into staying and accepting a much higher rate - blaming the ACA for it - and therefore scaring them away from the Exchange Marketplace. We've been hearing that the reason these plans were more expensive is because they had to cover preventive care (Limbaugh had a field-day with that one last week), but as shown above the Grandfathered Plans Didn't. It's a scam, it's all a scam.
10:13 AM PT: One more issue on Grandfathered Plans via the Comments
Plans could acquire grandfathered status by adding those features to the existing ones, they did not have to already have them in place.  Some of the elements, like the ""no lifetime cap"" one, were phased in over time, and therefore explicitly allowed adjustment of benefits in an existing plan.  Coverage of children under 26 is not likely to be a feature that many plans had in early 2010, yet clearly insurance plans have added this feature.  My current coverage has grandfathered status.  It had some of these features, like no lifetime cap, other benefits have been added or modified to comply with the grandfathering requirements.
So, you got that?  Grandfathered Plans are not written in unbendable, unbreakable Adamantium, they can and have been amended since 2010.   They don't have to meet all the requirements of the ACA, just a few of them and have to have existed since before the law was passed and signed - That's All.
So let's go back and revisit ""If you like your plan, you can keep it"" as being flawed or wrong.  It's NOT.  Instead of amending the plans to meet minimum grandfather requirements they are being Shutdown By the Insurance Industries Choice, not by ObamaCare.
1:34 PM PT: One final point that puts the LIE to the claim that these plans couldn't meet the Grandfathered requirements is the fact that There's Nothing New Required of Grandfathered Plans This Year.
The Lifting of the Lifetime Spending Cap has been phased in since 2010.
 The law restricts and phases out the annual dollar limits that all job-related plans, and individual health insurance plans issued after March 23, 2010, can put on most covered health benefits. Specifically, the law says that none of these plans can set an annual dollar limit lower than:
        $750,000: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2010 but before September 23, 2011.
        $1.25 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2011 but before September 23, 2012.
        $2 million: for a plan year or policy year starting on or after September 23, 2012 but before January 1, 2014.

No annual dollar limits are allowed on most covered benefits beginning January 1, 2014.
It's not like the ACA suddenly requires old insurance plans to do something this year, that they weren't essentially required to do last year - other than PAY peoples claims.
Similarly the ability to keep your children on your family plan isn't new, that was established in 2010.
ffective for Plan or Policy Years Beginning On or After September 23, 2010. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called on leading insurance companies to begin covering young adults voluntarily before the implementation date required by the Affordable Care Act (which is plan or policy years beginning on or after September 23rd). Early implementation would avoid gaps in coverage for new college graduates and other young adults and save on insurance company administrative costs of dis-enrolling and re-enrolling them between May 2010 and September 23, 2010. Over 65 companies have responded to this call saying they will voluntarily continue coverage for young adults who graduate or age off their parents' insurance before the implementation deadline.
Lastly the requirement to spend at least 80% of your premiums on care and not administrative costs has already been in effect, that's why people have been getting rebate checks.
A new provision of the Affordable Care Act — called the Medical Loss Ratio, or the “80/20″ provision — could mean some Americans will see a rebate from their health insurance companies tomorrow.
The provision is aimed at holding health insurance companies accountable for how they spend the money collected through premiums. It compares the dollars they spend on health care costs vs. other overhead costs — like marketing, salaries and administrative expenses.

Grandfathered plans don't have to cover pre-existing conditions.  Grandfathered plans don't have to provide free preventive care services. (High Co-Pays and Deductibles can remain)  Grandfathered plans can still limit yearly coverage (in the individual market).
In short, there is no New Special Expensive OBAMACARE Requirement on existing Grandfathered plans other the fact that the lifetime cap has gone from $2 Million to Infinite and they can't arbitrarily CANCEL your insurance between renewal periods. They can only do it at the end of you plan year, which is exactly what they're doing - simply because they can, not because Obamacare put some onerous expensive requirement on them.
Just about everything they were required by the ACA to do this year, they had to do LAST YEAR, and the year before that.  Even more than when I first wrote this diary now believe these ""ObamaCare Cancellations"" are a SCAM.

Apparently the media is growing tired of the White House selectively releasing ObamaCare data that gets to the heart of nothing but makes the program look like it is much more popular than it likely is. For instance, today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday, Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits. 
We have also been told  that the site’s error rate was .077 percent, the response time averaged under a second, and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy. 
As The Hill points out, though, that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose, or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose, just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:
The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.
Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.
But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout, such as the enrollment site’s back end.
The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled, but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%. 
Up until now, though, the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end. 
The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:
Since late October, federal health officials have touted traffic to the site, error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.
Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly, and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools, such as applicants’ ages, goes undiscussed.
The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.
The metrics released are difficult to independently verify, but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act, including congressional Democrats.
Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday, Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently, but provided no details. 
While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful, The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words, those who have actually paid for a premium.
The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing, but never the data that matters, has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now, that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle, the media has apparently had enough.

During Thursday’s congressional hearing, Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) tore into the ObamaCare contractors for a hidden line of source code that secretly surrenders the ObamaCare applicant’s right to privacy. It was yet another damning revelation about the snoopiest White House ever, and by Friday, CNN’s Carol Costello was in full attack mode using misinformation to push back for the Administration.  
Costello invited Barton on her Friday morning show, and after Barton reiterated his concern over ObamaCare’s secret and deceptive disclaimer, Costello dug in:
Well, I’ve been wondering about that. The only health-related question the website asks of you is whether you smoke. It doesn’t ask any other question. So what specifically are you talking about? What specific information would you share on this website that you wouldn’t normally share?
Before we get to Barton’s very specific answer, I have to interrupt to point out how stunningly ignorant Costello’s question is. First off, even if she was correct about the smoking question being the only health-related question, it is still a health-related question, and therefore a violation of HIPAA. Secondly, my understanding of HIPAA is that it not only protects your medical information, but also your personal information. And as someone who actually has gone through the ObamaCare application process, I can testify (and did here in detail) that the site asks a number of personal questions I “wouldn’t normally share.” 
Regardless, why is this secret disclaimer not a big deal to a supposed journalist? We are talking about the federal government slipping in a line of code that will sucker millions into surrendering their privacy rights altogether, not just what qualifies under HIPAA.
But Costello is stuck on her White House talking points that claim HIPAA only covers medical information and the smoking question is no big deal. 
Well, watch what happens next: Barton lists three more medical-related questions the ObamaCare website asks: your current insurance plan and its policy number, your mental and physical condition, and whether or not you are pregnant. 
And what is Costello’s response? Does she say, “Oh, I didn’t know that. If you are correct, that is a problem.” 
Nope. She just babbles on with her talking points as though she didn’t hear Barton answer her question with damning specifics:

The Obama administration decided that Obamacare Navigators, tasked with helping Americans enroll in a health insurance plan, would not undergo mandatory background checks. Now, in the ten weeks since the launch of Healthcare.gov, the ill-trained Navigators have put Americans’ sensitive health and tax information at risk. 
Breitbart News has obtained a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee report on the Obamacare Navigators that will be released Monday. It has found that Obamacare Navigators have been giving Americans misinformation and, in some cases, actively encouraging enrollees to commit fraud in order to raise their subsidies. To complicate matters further, there is no way for Americans to find out whether their Navigators are properly certified.
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said at a Congressional hearing that it was “possible” for convicted felons to become Navigators. The report, titled Risks of Fraud and Misinformation with ObamaCare Outreach Campaign: How Navigator and Assister Program Mismanagement Endangers Consumers, concludes that is only one of many worries Americans should have about Navigators. 
The Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), and HHS actually learned that “poorly-trained Navigators gave consumers incorrect information about the health care exchanges, violated HHS rules and procedures, and even encouraged applicants to commit tax fraud in some instances.” Moreover, this was learned from various news reports due to the complete lack of any internal oversight.
On November 21, the Obama administration briefed the Committee. Those in attendance included Gary Cohen, the Deputy Administrator and Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), and Mandy Cohen, Director of the Consumer Support Group at CCIIO.
The Committee report concluded that “documents call into question the effectiveness of the Navigator program and the Obama administration’s ability to safeguard consumer information.” HHS’s mismanagement of the Navigator and Assister programs “induces fraudulent behavior and poses real threats to the safety of consumers’ personally identifiable information, such as one’s social security number, yearly income, and other sensitive tax information,” the report found.
The report also discovered that Obamacare Navigators have “encouraged consumers to commit tax fraud by underreporting income in order to qualify for ObamaCare’s health insurance subsidies.” Some have “assisted applicants before completing their 5 to 20 hour online training course, and others took custody of paper applications and mailed them for the applicant, violating the rule that applicants must mail in the application themselves.” 
For instance, the Committee found:
The report found that HHS officials responsible for the Navigator program did not learn of the aforementioned incidents from internal oversight procedures, but rather from news reports. 
Yet the Obama administration still does not plan to implement a “secret shopper” program to monitor Navigators. HHS officials have put together “webinars” for Navigators, but they are voluntary and do not cover specific details.
The report also found that because the Obama administration did not warn Navigators that there could be problems with the HealthCare.Gov website, “Navigators were essentially useless” when the website crashed and had problems. To make matters worse, notes from an October 11, 2013 meeting state that the Navigators were encouraging potential enrollees to use paper applications they knew may not bring applicants quicker results “to protect their reputations as people in the communities who can help.”
The Committee found that this “push towards the use of paper applications further increases security risks, since health insurance exchange applications contain personally identifiable information such as the applicant’s full name, social security number, the names and social security numbers of everyone in the applicant’s household, and income for every member of the household.”
The report also concluded that Navigators were also unprepared to handle situations in which consumers mentioned unreported income because the Obama administration did not even anticipate such situations. Gary Cohen, the director of the agency overseeing the Navigators, previously stated, “this could be one of the areas where it is a little beyond the ability of your average Navigator,” when asked whether Navigators knew how to deal with Americans who may be engaging in tax fraud or intending to under-report income. 
Though Cohen “admitted there is a need for better training on the issue through the ongoing education process” and did not rule out “requiring Navigators to report tax fraud in the future,” the Obama administration “has not taken the necessary steps to prevent this type of tax fraud.” The report found that Navigators have not even been provided with a document on how to handle potential tax fraud issues that may arise. 
Navigators, the report also found, “lack guidance about how to comply with the Voting Rights Act, which requires that federal government applications provide the opportunity for applicants to indicate their interest in registering to vote.”
And though Cohen told the Committee staff that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services “[keep] a list of certified Navigators, which, as of mid-November, numbered 2,500 individuals,” the list is private, which means Americans do not have a way to know if their Navigators are actually even certified. That also allows Navigator organizations to “misrepresent the qualifications of an individual who is associated with that organization but is not a certified Navigator,” the committee found.

62,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/13/Top-10-Senate-Dems-Who-Should-Apologize,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,10 Senate Dems Who Should Apologize for ObamaCare,"

Last week, President Obama apologized for misleading the American public with his false claim that “if you like your insurance, you can keep it.” Without this assurance, it is unlikely ObamaCare would have passed. Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized, they should as well, as they are equally culpable. 
Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance. 
If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress, so be it. 
10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have, you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball, 12/16/09)
Mary Landrieu, like all Senate Democrats, provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years, it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu, who is up for reelection next year, lied on TV. She should apologize. 
9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired,” National Journal’s Congress Daily, 6/18/09)
160,000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder, since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September,  Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize. 
8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now, you got a medical professional you want, you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas, make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”
Begich won his Senate seat in 2008, after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska, without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize. 
7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it. If you have your doctor, and you like him or her, you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”
Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC, the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.  
6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again, if you like what you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by the President, you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray, Congressional Record, S.6400, 6/10/09)
Let me say this again, as a senior member, and now Chair of the Budget Committee, Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290,000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize. 
5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus, the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin, Congressional Record, S.7675-6, 9/29/10)
Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate, Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin, who is retiring, should absolutely apologize. 
4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance, you keep it.” (U.S. Senate, Finance Committee, Bill Mark-Up, 9/24/09)
Schumer, who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology, though, is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still, he should apologize. 
3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like, you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with, you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin, Teleconference, 12/4/09)
Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate, amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event, he should apologize. 
2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact, one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid, Congressional Record, S.8642, 8/3/09)
Core principles, apparently, aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader, he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House, at the time, was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely, Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.
And, the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize… 
1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus, Congressional Record, S.7676, 9/29/10)
Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know, and had to know, that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.
He should apologize, but unfortunately, he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night.

Speaking in Ireland this week, President Obama stated that Catholic schools were divisive: “If towns remain divided–if Catholics have their schools and buildings and Protestants have theirs, if we can’t see ourselves in one another and fear or resentment are allowed to harden–that too encourages division and discourages cooperation.” On Thursday, the American Catholics for Religious Freedom fired back on President Obama’s words to 2,000 young people at the G8 Summit, stating, “President Obama’s anti-faith, secular agenda was shamefully on full display yesterday when he told the young people of Northern Ireland that Catholic education and other faith-based schools were divisive and an obstacle to peace.  All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”
American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story, and adds, “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution.  He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”
And, they note, this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom, for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life,” the group concludes.

The alleged use of deadly chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians and opponents on the anniversary of President Barack Obama’s “red line” statement might have marked the collapse of Obama’s foreign policy–if such policy actually existed. In fact, however, the Obama administration has no foreign policy other than its continued opposition to the perceived postures of George W. Bush, more than four years gone.
Obama’s policy in Syria had been to rehabilitate the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad. Well before he won the presidency, Democrats–including current Secretary of State John Kerry–made a point of visiting Assad to show their approach to foreign relations was different from, and more effective than, the allegedly confrontational approach of the Bush administration. Syria’s nuclear weapons program, exposed when Israel destroyed it in 2007, did not prompt any change in Democrats’ approach to the regime.
Therefore Obama renewed diplomatic relations and re-opened the U.S. embassy in Damascus, elevating the status of the regime. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton even referred to Assad as a “reformer.” The hope was that doing so would convince him to side with the U.S. over Iran, and to win goodwill in the Arab world more generally.
In Egypt, the Obama administration adopted a similar approach, i.e. appeasing a tyrant with the intention of establishing a clear break with Bush’s pressure for democratic reforms and encourage a new perception of the U.S. as more open to the Arab and Muslim worlds. In the midst of an orgy of federal spending, Obama cut funding for pro-democracy groups in Egypt and prioritized relations with Hosni Mubarak’s regime.
At the same time, however, Obama began trying to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood, not because he wished to encourage a democratic process in Egypt that might include their participation, but because he wished to appease Islamist sentiment in general. His administration refused, for example, to identify radical Islam as the source of terrorism, and even redefined the term “war on terror” itself as “overseas contingency operations.”
Therefore when the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, the Obama administration initially tried to argue that he was not a “dictator.” Then, as media criticism began to mount, Obama switched sides and backed Mubarak’s ouster, all the while claiming that he had not, in fact, changed his policy. His previous efforts to rehabilitate the Muslim Brotherhood as a legitimate organization gave some amount–though not much–of legitimacy to that claim. 
Today, in the aftermath of the Egyptian coup, Obama’s foreign policy has lost even the pretense of principle. He is showing outrage at the Egyptian military’s treatment of the Muslim Brotherhood protestors, cutting some aid and canceling joint military exercises (none of which he did in response to the Brotherhood’s own excesses when in power). Yet he refuses to call the coup itself a “coup,” or to cut all aid to the Egyptian military.
Meanwhile, in Syria, Obama is still refusing to do anything that might actually deter the regime from using banned weapons–such as imposing a no-fly zone, for instance–while accelerating aid to the Syrian rebels, who are dominated by anti-American jihadists. His policies are all half-measures and contradictions. Faced with the fact that his academic anti-colonialism has little real-world relevance, he is just avoiding any real commitments.
In fact, the only real foreign policy priority of the Obama administration is to avoid being blamed for anything that could possibly go wrong. He concluded his remarks on Egypt last week by insisting: “We don’t take sides with any particular party or political figure. I know it’s tempting inside of Egypt to blame the United States or the West or some other outside actor for what’s gone wrong.” The buck stops…with Egypt, he said. Not with me.
That is not to say that the Middle East’s current problems are easy to resolve. Republicans and conservatives have had a tough time coming to a consensus about what should be done. The Arab world presents only bad options and worse options: a genocidal regime in Syria versus brutal jihadist groups; a military tyranny in Egypt versus radical Islamists with hegemonic ambitions. The dangerous temptation to withdraw is strong.
The one point of agreement among conservatives–even the likes of Patrick Buchanan, these days–is that the U.S. should primarily be concerned with shoring up Israel against common enemies such as Al Qaeda and Iran. In other words, the best path might be to focus on the sole U.S. ally in the region. But the Obama administration has done the opposite, pressuring Israel and giving Iran leeway, despite continued frustration.
It is arguable that the Bush administration had a similarly rudderless foreign policy when it took office in 2001, driven only by the desire to do the opposite of its predecessor. Yet it pulled together a new strategy–however flawed–after 9/11, when circumstances had changed. Obama has failed to learn from crisis–whether the Green Revolution in Iran in 2009, or the Arab Spring and its aftermath. “Not Bush” is a non-policy, but a real failure."

Um ... oops?



Um ... oops?

Let's all just savor this, shall we? The House Republicans release a scathing report blaming Hillary Clinton for something-something-Benghazi, because something-something-Benghazi is the newest Fox News conspiracy theory and there's really just nothing, and I mean nothing, that the Congress of the United States of America needs to spend their time on more than Fox News conspiracy theories. That's a given. Darrell Issa exists to investibate those theories. The entire House Oversight Committee has been turned into an episode of Scooby Doo where Obama or Hillary Clinton are behind literally every bad thing that happens in America, from solar companies going bust to children getting cavities.
The smoking gun in the new Republican report? That Hillary Clinton ""signed"" memos rejecting stepped-up security at the compound, thus proving that everything was all her fault, period, exclamation point, Ronald Reagan smiley face. There's only one little problem with that: Clinton did not ""sign"" the letter. Darrell Issa and the rest of the Crack House Investigative Team of Superheroes got confused on a basic fact of how the State Department works, and not one of them bothered to actually freaking check, just once, with the State Department as to their top-notch theory of things:
[By tradition], every cable from an embassy bears the “signature” of the ambassador — and every cable from Washington bears the “signature” of the secretary of state. The protocol is explained in the State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual: […]
Because of this protocol, “Secretary Clinton ‘signed’ hundreds of thousands of cables during her tenure as secretary,” said State Department spokesman Patrick H. Ventrell. “As then-Secretary Clinton testified, the security cables related to Benghazi did not come to her attention. These cables were reviewed at the assistant secretary level.”

Yep. The entire House Republican ""investigative"" team didn't know that, and they didn't check, and/or they didn't listen to Every Damn State Department Employee Who Could Tell Them That. Or, as Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings puts it:
“The allegations in your staff report are false, extremely irresponsible, and lack even a rudimentary understanding of how State Department cables are processed,” Cummings wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). […]
“Although a telephone call could have clarified this issue in a matter of moments, you chose not to check with the Department before making these highly inflammatory and erroneous accusations in a public forum.”

Has there ever been a Congress more incompetent than this one? I don't mean partisan, or mean, or ineffective—I mean stone-cold incompetent. This is the sort of thing that really should require a public pie in the face for all involved, and the House Republican caucus is just goddamn stupid enough that we could probably get that required public pie-ing passed as actual bill, providing we bury it in some language about continued oil subsidies or free guns to American toddlers.

Seven hundred retired Military Special Operations professionals from the organization “Special Operations Speaks” sent a letter to the House of Representatives urging members to support H.Res 36, which will create a House Select Committee to investigate last September’s deadly terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.  

Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA), a sub-committee chairman on the House Appropriations Committee, issued a resolution for a House Select Committee to investigate issues surrounding the Benghazi Attack last November in the 112th Congress. He re-issued his resolution for the select committee when the 113th Congress began. The resolution currently has over 60 co-sponsors.
Only Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) can appoint a Select Committee and Boehner appears to mainly rely on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate the Benghazi attack. However, any information that may be garnered from that committee will, as always, remain classified.
“As a retired Special Operations officer who spent most of my thirty-six years preparing for and executing rescue missions to save fellow Americans, I am deeply troubled by the events in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. The men and women who I served with lived by an ethos that pledged to never leave a fallen comrade and to make every effort to respond when a fellow American was threatened. I have seen men take great risks to save a fellow warrior. I have even seen men die trying to do so,” wrote General William G. ‘Jerry’ Boykin in a statement to Breitbart News. 
Boykin added, “The lack of accountability regarding the Benghazi event disturbs me greatly and bears the earmarks of a cover up. America is entitled to a full accounting of this egregious attack on our people with some explanation as to why there was no effort to save the Americans in the US Embassy annex and the CIA station, or at least to recover their bodies before they fell into Libyan hands. Our Congress has yet to fulfill its responsibility to provide a complete analysis of the attack or to provide answers as to what exactly happened. A  bi-partisan Special Committee is needed to determine the truth about Benghazi.”
Last month, Rep. Wolf, along with Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA), a House Ways and Means Committee member, sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more information on State Department employees who survived the Benghazi attack. In his letter to Kerry, Wolf noted that sources say that as many as 30 survivors of the Benghazi attack were allegedly wounded. Seven of those thirty were said to be critical injuries.  Sec. Kerry confirmed he visited an injured Benghazi survivor at Walter Reed. 
Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, pointed to Kerry’s admission as a reason why he expects to speak with Benghazi survivors. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a Senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees,” Issa told Breitbart News. 
Since Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) first told Breitbart News in December that the Obama administration had not been allowing him or any other member of Congress to see Benghazi survivors, more Republican members, including Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John McCain (R-AZ) are calling for survivors to be allowed to testify at hearings on Capitol Hill without fear of legal or career repercussions.
Signers of the letter believe the House Select Committee should look into a number of issues, including the lack of military response to the events in Benghazi, if any non-military assistance was provided during the attack; the number U.S. personnel who were injured in Benghazi; the current locations of survivors; the names of the individuals in the White House Situation Room (WHSR) during the entire 8-hour period of the attacks and was a senior US military officer present.
“As veterans from all aspects of Special Operations, we have no doubt that there’s a lot more to what happened in Benghazi than President Obama and his Administration are letting on. From the very beginning, he has attempted to mislead and outright lied to the American people about why the attack on September 11th, 2012 happened, how it happened, and what our government did or did not do to save the lives of our patriots abroad,” former Navy SEAL Captain Larry Bailey wrote in a statement to Breitbart News.
The representatives from the retired military community want “a full accounting of the events of September 11, 2012,” adding that the,  “American public be fully informed regarding this egregious terrorist attack on US diplomatic personnel and facilities. We owe that truth to the American people and the families of the fallen.”

Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) said Friday that the resignation of President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is not enough. He said Attorney General Eric Holder should step down too.
“One down and one to go,” Gosar said in a statement. “While Secretary Napolitano may be gone she will not be forgotten. Her inaction and incompetence on border security will continue to plague our nation for years to come.”
“‘See no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil’ is no way to govern and yet it is exactly how she and this administration operates,” he continued. “The American public deserve better.”
Gosar added that it is time for Holder to resign as well.
“What the American people need now is for Attorney General Eric Holder to follow her lead and resign,” Gosar said. “The American people have no confidence in him or his ability to do his job. My message to him would be: Better late than never. Today is a good day to go.”
Gosar has a resolution in the House calling for Holder’s resignation that a number of members of Congress have signed onto. During the previous session, 130 House members, eight U.S. Senators, and several governors from around the country called for Holder to resign over Operation Fast and Furious. 
In Fast and Furious, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed 2,000 weapons bought through straw purchases to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. Holder remains in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for his failure to cooperate with the congressional investigation into the scandal, which left hundreds of Mexican citizens and U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry dead. 
President Obama has asserted executive privilege to continue concealing thousands of pages of documents related to the scandal from Congress.
Fast and Furious is hardly Holder’s only problem moving forward, especially as House Republicans draw closer to obtaining the documents uncovered via a federal court lawsuit. The Attorney General faces multiple scandals, particularly his decision to approve secret investigations into members of the news media. Holder reportedly met with President Obama on a forthcoming report on the DOJ’s activities in regards to that issue on Friday.
The Associated Press noted how Gosar’s harsh words for Napolitano contrast sharply with those of his fellow Arizona Republican, Sen. John McCain. McCain rushed to praise Napolitano for her work, saying she “served our nation with honor.”
Napolitano’s DHS released hundreds of illegal aliens from prisons earlier this year, citing the sequester as the reason."

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) will honor former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with this year’s Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. The award will be presented to Clinton on September 10th, the eve of the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the United States mission in Benghazi that killed four Americans.
The Christian Science Monitor reports that Bush, a potential GOP contender in the 2016 presidential race, is chairman of the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center located in Philadelphia.  
“Former Secretary Clinton has dedicated her life to serving and engaging people across the world in democracy,” Bush said in a statement. “These efforts as a citizen, an activist, and a leader have earned Secretary Clinton this year’s Liberty Medal.” 
Bush’s decision to honor Clinton, who is considered by some to be a likely Democrat candidate for president in 2016, was condemned by the Independence Hall Tea Party Association of Philadelphia. According to the Christian Science Monitor, the organization released its own statement Monday, referring to the event as “extremely distressing,” and offering, instead, an opportunity for another Liberty Medal recipient. 
According to the statement: 
As all of you undoubtedly know, much of the blame for the Obama Administration’s failure to contain the Benghazi attack and the scandalous handling of its aftermath, can be traced directly to Ms. Clinton. 
Indeed, a Congressional investigation regarding Ms. Clinton’s role in the cover-up of the Administration’s failure is still ongoing. 
A newly formed organization, the Independence Hall Foundation, will hold a “What Difference Does It Make” press conference on Independence Mall, September 10, 4 PM, to denounce the selection of Ms. Clinton as the 2013 Liberty Medal recipient and to offer an alternative award (details below). 
During the conference, the Foundation will name its choice of recipient(s) for the 2013 Defender of Liberty Medal. 
Dom Giordano will headline the presser and we certainly hope you will consider joining us. 
A 5 PM Prayer Vigil for the victims of the Benghazi attack will immediately follow the press conference.  
The National Constitution Center’s announcement, dated June 27th, about the award of the Liberty Medal to Clinton, states: 
As Secretary of State, Clinton advocated for “smart power” in foreign policy, elevating diplomacy and development and repositioning them for the 21st century – with new tools, technologies, and partners, including the private sector and civil society around the world. 
National Constitution Center president and CEO Jeffrey Rosen said, “Hillary Clinton has devoted her life to expanding opportunities for ‘We the People’ not just in this country but around the globe.”  
Upon the announcement of Clinton’s award in June, Gateway Pundit’s Jim Hoft wrote, “Really Jeb, no one else came to mind?”"

Raw Story
A law is advancing through the Wisconsin state legislature that would double the job-seeking requirements for people collecting unemployment and which would allow the government to peer into their bank accounts and freeze them if they believe the account holder has received overpayments in their benefits. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, the co-authors of the bill, which was introduced in the state Assembly and Senate on Friday, insist that the changes would be for workers’ own good.
“This is to protect the workers and lessen the burden on employers who are paying all the bills,” said state Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown).
-------
Democratic state Rep. Christine Sinicki (Milwaukee) said that the law is another salvo by Republicans against working people and the middle class. She also worried that Republicans would make the bill even more intrusive and draconian during the legislative mark-up process.

This is yet another outrageous assault on working people and the unemployed.
I was working last week. I got my layoff/separation notice Friday. I am unemployed Monday. It's the 6th time I have been laid off in 20 years and the 4 time since I bought my home and the 3rd time since I got married.
Republicans have elevated blaming the victims of capitalism to a high art. And the Unemployed are VICTIMS of GOP economic policies.
It would force job applicants to apply for twice as many jobs to remain eligible for benefits. Currently employment seekers must apply for two jobs per week to keep unemployment benefits flowing. The new law raises that number to four.
There are no jobs. Republicans worked to kill jobs the Obama administration had set up - killed rail projects as a 2-fer: no rail for efficient transport (aids big oil and big auto and big credit) and killed jobs.
Wall Street and the 1% are off-shoring TRILLIONS of dollars, APPLE wants laws changed so it can bring billions of untaxed dollars into the US and republicans want to spy on back accounts of the POOR?
It's wholly mean-spirited, part of the GOP agenda to be as mean and awful to the poor as possible.
It is unacceptable.

This morning, CNN had only released some of the results of their poll.  Now, they've released the second part, and boy, it's a doozy for the GOP.
In a sign of the political hangover congressional Republicans are suffering in the wake of the government shutdown, three-quarters of Americans in a new national poll say that most GOP members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected.
A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there's plenty of time for these numbers to change.
....
More than seven in 10 questioned in the survey said that most members of Congress don't deserve to be re-elected, with nearly four in 10 saying even their own representative doesn't deserve a return ticket to Washington next year. Both figures are hovering around all-time highs in CNN polling.
""Although incumbent members of Congress of both parties are not very popular, the shutdown seems to have only affected views of GOP incumbents,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.
Three-fourths of people questioned in the survey said that most congressional Republicans don't deserved to be re-elected, 21 percentage points higher than the 54% who say most Democrats don't deserve another term in office. Only one in five say most Republicans deserve to be re-elected; 42% say the same thing about Democrats on Capitol Hill.

Now, this question was asked of all Americans, and NOT of registered voters (and obviously not of likely voters).  The CNN poll did ask it of registered voters as well, and from the smaller sample, registered voters were slightly more angry at both parties.  Here, I've put it in chart form.
Deserve re-election?

      Yes    No
Dem   40%   56%
GOP   20%   76%

Of note, that 40% for Democrats among registered voters is actually not the worst we've seen in recent history.  The August 2010 numbers had only 36% of registered voters saying Democrats deserved re-election to Congress.  However, that 20% for the GOP is the lowest in the poll's history by far, surpassing the previous low of just 31%, taken back in August 2011 during the last debt ceiling fight.
This is now spilling over into the generic ballot question as well.
Fifty percent of registered voters questioned said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, with 42% backing the Republican. The 8-point Democratic margin in the CNN poll is the same as in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey and close to the 9-point advantage for the Democrats in the generic ballot in a recent Quinnipiac University poll.
""We're a long way away from saying that the Democrats have a chance to regain control of the House,"" Holland cautioned. ""There is more than a year to go before any votes are actually cast and the 'generic ballot' question is not necessarily a good predictor of the actual outcome of 435 separate elections. A year before the 2010 midterms, for example, the Democrats held a 6-point lead on the generic ballot.""
The Republicans eventually won back control of the House in 2010, thanks to a historic 63-seat pickup.

So again, while the signs look good now, they looked good for Democrats as well in 2010, and we all know the misery that followed.  The generic ballot question almost always overestimates how well Democrats will do an entire year out from the actual election.  Notice in 2006, a good year for Democrats, it only overestimated by a tiny bit.  But in the midterm years good for the GOP, like 2002 and 2010, anyone thinking we were going to do OK because of the generic ballot question was in for a rude awakening.  So recent history tells us that even if 2014 turns out to be a good year for Democrats, the generic ballot question STILL overestimates how well we're going to do a year ahead, but only by a little.
Notice in the 2010 average of the polls, on October 21, 2009 (exactly 4 years ago), Democrats held a 45%-39.5% advantage on the generic ballot question.  And then a year later, a massive 63-seat loss in the House, with Republicans actually getting 51.6% of the vote, and Democrats only getting 44.8% of the vote.
So, while this poll is good news, don't you dare take anything for granted just yet.

The headline reads, “McAuliffe avoids position on EPA rules, Cuccinelli dodges on House spending vote,” because just like Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe, the left-wing Washington Post wants to have it both ways. In an article published Friday, the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over, bizarrely, DC’s ongoing budget battles. 
But as hard as the Post might try, there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.
At the bottom of its article, the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:
“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government, he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same,” Cullen said, referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down, period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress, he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”
Fast Terry, however, has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country, and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another, the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:
Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists, economists, and military leaders, who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia,” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost, low-carbon energy, he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”
Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:
“The administration renewed its war on coal today,” Cuccinelli said, adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.
It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls, however, directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs. 
Instead of choosing a position, McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen, the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.

In a classic tale illustrating the “law of unintended consequences,” a new report concludes that President Barack Obama’s $3 billion “Cash for Clunkers” taxpayer-funded boondoggle artificially drove car prices up, not down, and unleashed an “environmental nightmare” through shredding, not recycling, many of the 690,000 cars people traded in for an up to $4,500 car credit.
In 2009, Mr. Obama proudly declared that his Cash for Clunkers program, officially known as the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS), was a stunning success.  “There were skeptics who weren’t sure that this ‘Cash for Clunkers’ program would work,” said Mr. Obama. “But I’m happy to report that it has succeeded well beyond our expectations and all expectations, and we’re already seeing a dramatic increase in showroom traffic at local car dealers…So I’m very pleased with the progress that’s been made in the House today on the “Cash for Clunkers” program.” 
But as Yahoo News notes, the program’s decision to shred, not recycle, many of the trade-in vehicles unleashed an “environmental nightmare”: 
Shredding vehicles results in its own environmental nightmare. For each ton of metal produced by a shredding facility, roughly 500 pounds of “shredding residue” is also produced, which includes polyurethane foams, metal oxides, glass and dirt. All totaled, about 4.5 million tons of that residue is already produced on average every year. Where does it go? Right into a landfill.
E Magazine states recycling just the plastic and metal alone from the CARS scraps would have saved 24 million barrels of oil. While some of the “Clunkers” were truly old, many of the almost 700,000 cars were still in perfectly good condition. In fact, many that qualified for the program were relatively “young,” with fuel efficiencies that rivaled newer cars.
A study conducted by Resources for the Future further underscored the program’s failure economically and environmentally:
Approximately 45 percent of the spending went to consumers who would have purchased a new vehicle anyway. Our results suggest no gain in sales beyond 2009 and hence no meaningful stimulus to the economy. In addition, the program will reduce CO2 emissions by only 9 to 28.4 million tons, implying a cost per ton ranging from $91 to $288 even after accounting for reduced criteria pollutants.   
And E–The Environmental Magazine says the Department of Transportation’s declaration that Cash for Clunkers was a success is simply a case of smoke and mirrors:
The Department of Transportation reported that Cash for Clunkers was an environmental success…In general, drivers traded in inefficient SUVs and trucks for more efficient passenger cars. However, it’s quite easy to negate this small difference in gas mileage purely by the fact that people will be more likely to drive a vehicle that takes less money to fill up with gas. It’s an efficiency paradox: as we get more efficient at using energy, the overall cost of energy goes down, but we respond by using more of it. Auto emissions of carbon dioxide are directly proportional to gasoline consumed. With only 690,000 fuel-efficient vehicles purchased and over 250 million cars registered in the U.S., that is a negligible difference in overall greenhouse gas emissions.
As the Washington Post even conceded, Mr. Obama’s Cash for Clunkers scheme was an economic and environmental failure: “So were the naysayers right?” asked the Post.  “It seems so.”

Better-informed people on the right seem, finally, to be facing up to a horrible truth: Health care reform, President Obama’s signature policy achievement, is probably going to work.
  Which of course is why Republicans are desperately trying to block it from going into effect.  Because,
Successful health reform wouldn’t just be a victory for a president conservatives loathe, it would be an object demonstration of the falseness of right-wing ideology. So Republicans are being driven into a last, desperate effort to head this thing off at the pass.
That is the main idea Paul Krugman explores in his New York Times column today.   It is an idea he has broached before, in his blog, as I wrote about here 9 days ago.  But the blog post was a brief exploration of the topic that Krugman more thoroughly explores this morning.
Please keep reading.


Krugman reminds us of the three simple ideas upon which the Affordable Care Act is based:
1.  All Americans, even those with pre-existing conditions, should have access to affordable health insurance
2.  All Americans, even those currently healthy, should be required  (or induced) to buy insurance to spread the risks as broadly as possible to keep the costs reasonable
3.  There should be subsidiess to prevent the ""mandate"" from becoming too onerous, so that the cost of premiums as a share of income can be held down.
As to whether this approach can work, despite the Republican predictions that it will fail, we of course have the example of Romneycare in Massachusetts (based, I remind people, largely on a proposal from the Right-leaning Heritage Foundation).  Krugman then explores whether larger starters with significant numbers of uninsured can duplicate what happened in the Bay State.  
The answer to this question depends, in the first place, on whether insurance companies are willing to offer coverage at reasonable rates. And the answer, so far, is a clear “yes.” In California, insurers came in with bids running significantly below expectations; in New York, it appears that premiums will be cut roughly in half.
apologies, but the latter link counts against your monthly quota from the NYTimes, so you might not be able to see it.
Krugman offers two paragraphs that frame the issue succinctly.  In the first he writes
Over all, then, health reform will help millions of Americans who were previously either too sick or too poor to get the coverage they needed, and also offer a great deal of reassurance to millions more who currently have insurance but fear losing it; it will provide these benefits at the expense of a much smaller number of other Americans, mostly the very well off. It is, if you like, a plan to comfort the afflicted while (slightly) afflicting the comfortable.
 So far the American people do not yet fully grasp that the vast majority of them will be better off with respect to medical insurance without being hit directly financially by the cost of premiums.  A small number of better off Americans will wind up paying somewhat more.   If the American people understand this, attempting to sabotage Obamacare will have serious political implications for Republicans.
There is also another problem for the GOP:
And the prospect that such a plan might succeed is anathema to a party whose whole philosophy is built around doing just the opposite, of taking from the “takers” and giving to the “job creators,” known to the rest of us as the “rich.” Hence the brinkmanship.
Krugman is very blunt about that philosophy, but then, we can remember a certain presidential candidate who complained about he 47% who are takers.  
brinkmanship - the willingness of the Republicans, particularly among their tea party caucus members in the House, to risk shutting down the government and crashing the economy in order to prevent the success of Obamacare,
when their own leaders have admitted that confrontations over the budget inflict substantial harm on the economy.
It will not be because of fear of what is now a rapidly falling budget deficit.
Nor, Krugman opines, will it be because they true believe that the slashing of federal spending will actually lead to increased prosperity.  
No, Republicans may be willing to risk economic and financial crisis solely in order to deny essential health care and financial security to millions of their fellow Americans. Let’s hear it for their noble cause!
Let me if I may explain just a bit what that noble cause is, paraphrasing well-known words of the first (and greatest) Republican President:
Government of the wealthy, by the Republicans, for the corporations
Anything that might threaten that paradigm is to be fought fiercely
- that includes suppressing the votes of those who might vote for a different paradigm
- that means fomenting fear and hatred on issues like guns in order to gin up an angry mob to vote against their own economic interests
- that includes gerrymandering to minimize the impact of votes of the masses of people who either do not agree with their paradigm or who may not be able to be misled by the promotion of fear and hatred
It is the mentality of the American Colonel who said in Vietnam that in order to save the village we had to destroy it.
It is the petulance of the child who if he can't have his way wants to take the ball and go home, even if someone else brought the ball.
If you wonder why the House Republicans have now voted almost 40 times to try to kill Obamacare, it is because if it succeeds, not only will they not be able to roll it back, but it also undercuts any arguments about the other social programs that for half a century or more they have tried to kill - Medicare, Medicaid and most of all Social Security.
Panic is the right words to describe Republican actions towards Obamacare.
Petulance is another appropriate description.
 Which is why the White House and the Democrats have to hold firm
- for the health (physical and economic) of the American people
- for the future (economic and political) of the United States.

Our Johnny-on-the-spot media elite are all over the devilish details of ObamaCare this week. The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow, and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it? 
In the media’s defense, some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010, but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government? 
As we all know, skeptical, forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media. 
Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral,” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.” 
In the meantime, out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true, insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums, and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover, contrary to Obama’s biggest promise, people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands. 
And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily, not from the ObamaMedia, naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.  
But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never, Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October, when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)
Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:
Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits, which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages. 
Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit? 
You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that, it’s really not simple at all.
And Wednesday’s New York Times:
‘Our revenues are about $8 million, but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108,000 out of our profits, which are just over $200,000, is a big deal,’ said Ms. Shein, who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.
You get my point. But if you don’t, Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here. 
Over at Investors Business Daily, they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years. 
A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.” 
Regardless, “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs, losing your employer-based insurance, having your hours cut back, and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class. 
The damage Obama, Democrats, the media, and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system?

Before the dust settled on the news that the Obama Administration was delaying the intrusive employer mandate until 2015, a new 606-page regulation was issued on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services stating it would now rely on self-reported income and employment verification in the state-run exchanges under ObamaCare. In other words, a welcome mat for fraud.
This is another startling development which is becoming part of a larger theme as ObamaCare is rolled out to the public. It is clear that the Affordable Care Act is unworkable. For those like myself who opposed it from the start, we saw the writing on the wall early on as President Obama’s signature health care legislation was rammed through the halls of Congress. If only then-Speaker Pelosi had insisted that her party read the legislation before passing it, maybe some of this would have come to light earlier on. While the eventual passage of the legislation was certain under Democrat control of Congress, maybe some Democrats now sounding the alarm about the devastating impact of the legislation would have done so sooner if they had read it while it was still a bill, not only after it became law.
As of now, ObamaCare is $1 trillion over budget; I say “as of now” because it’s almost certain that with the elimination of the anti-fraud measures the cost will further skyrocket, and there are examples to back up this theory.
In January, the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services began an effort to remove ineligible people from the state’s Medicaid rolls. The initial audit concluded that of the first 20,500 recipients screened, it was recommended 13,709 be removed from eligibility. The Chicago Tribune reports that “since 2000, Illinois Medicaid rolls have doubled, from fewer than 1.4 million people to nearly 2.8 million, or more than 1 in 5 Illinoisans.” In part because of the rising Medicaid rolls, the state’s backlog of unpaid bills is expected to grow to $21 billion by fiscal year 2018.
States are fascinating laboratories of democracy that can provide brilliant blueprints for other states and the federal government to follow. However, states can also serve as flashing red lights when plans go wrong. Illinois is a great example of how a lack of anti-fraud measures can drain a state’s coffers. As President Obama’s home state, he would be wise to take notice.
President Reagan famously said “trust but verify.” In light of the notion that the U.S. health care system makes up one-eighth of the economy, it’s my hope that this administration will grasp hold of this sensible advice."

This is the biggest fear of every Republican that should not have been if they had simply been party to the solution. Instead they lied, misinformed, and ultimately made what would be a great law, a law that will need improvement.
Kentucky is geared up with their health exchanges. They are now informing residents of how to get access to health insurance. They market their Obamacare state exchange under the Kynect name. The following reported encounter with a Kentuckian shows the dangers of being misinformed.

A middle-aged man in a red golf shirt shuffles up to a small folding table with gold trim, in a booth adorned with a flotilla of helium balloons, where government workers at the Kentucky State Fair are hawking the virtues of Kynect, the state’s health benefit exchange established by Obamacare.
The man is impressed. ""This beats Obamacare I hope,"" he mutters to one of the workers.
“Do I burst his bubble?” wonders Reina Diaz-Dempsey, overseeing the operation. She doesn't. If he signs up, it's a win-win, whether he knows he's been ensnared by Obamacare or not.

More on Obamacare—or Kynect—below the fold.



Right Wing Republicans have so maligned the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that they actually began to believe their own lying and misinforming rhetoric. Fortunately all the data suggest that Obamacare is actually working. Americans will now have brochures with actual plans and options to choose from. They can now compare reality with the lies they heard.
Anyone wondering why Right Wing Republicans are in overdrive to shut the government down lest Obamacare is defunded realizes the eyes of many Americans are about to be opened. The millions that will see not a giveaway but help in getting access to affordable health insurance, screenings, and health care for the first time in years are also voters. They are voters that will wonder how a politician could be so convincingly evil to have wanted them denied something many needed for their health care or financial survival.
Kentucky Republican Senator Mitch McConnell is adamant that Obamacare be defunded. But Kentucky citizens are yearning for health insurance.

The crush of people don't greet Diaz-Dempsey with tea party dogma or amateur constitutional scholarship. No one is there to complain about the individual mandate or heckle about death panels. They have questions.
They wonder if they could get coverage despite having a pre-existing medical condition, how much it will cost them. They ask if Indiana has a similar program, or if this was only for Kentucky. Could they just enroll their child? They talk about their sons and daughters, neighbors going without health care, and ask about the subsidies.
The vast majority are relieved to learn about the health exchange. Linda Parrish, 47, showed up at the table and gushed to Diaz-Dempsey: ""This is what I've been waiting on."" Parrish has health insurance, but her best friend doesn't.

It is not all roses in Kentucky. The tea party has been calling people telling them not to sign up because they falsely claim there are no real health insurance exchanges. Many low income workers are against it because they were lied to about what the costs would be.

Christopher McClure hobbles through the doors, his inner thigh hurting from what he suspects are a pair of spider bites. He is not employed and does not have health insurance. His wife Michelle, 29, works as an assistant manager at a pizza chain making $12,000 a year. She also has no insurance and would qualify for the Medicaid expansion. But she's against Obamacare, convinced that it will wipe out her meager earnings. “Next enrollment season,"" she says, ""they’re going to sock it to me.”

The McClures under Obamacare would be fully subsidized. They are so misinformed that they have no clue that Obamacare is that one leg on the stool that removes a financial burden that is materially affecting their access to real financial independence. It makes sense to remove the health care anchor from people’s neck giving them the wherewithal to go seek a job or make their own job.
The reelection of President Obama which makes it impossible to kill Obamacare before implementation is the best thing that has happened to the uninsured, the poor, and the working middle class. The pilfering of the last disposable dollar by insurance companies will eventually end. Medical bankruptcy will cease and families’ economic stabilization will begin.

The sequester brings a lot of big, damaging cuts to government programs and services. The problem is, if Republicans get anything close to their way—and remember, it's Democrats they're bargaining with, so there's a good chance Republicans do get much of what they want—the solution could be as bad as the problem of sequestration. Social Security and Medicaid aren't sequestered. But cutting those programs has been on the Republican wish list for a long time, and will be one of their demands.
The question is how hard Democrats will fight to protect the programs that seniors rely on and that give non-seniors the promise of being able to retire without living in abject poverty.
""The president has made one of his bottom lines that significant revenues have to be on the table,"" said Chuck Loveless, the director of legislation for AFSCME, a major public services employees union. ""If he sticks to his guns on that I'm not worried, but chained CPI is on his shortlist. We oppose that, and it is a significant cut to social security.""
It should go without saying that if Democrats agree to cut Social Security benefits, even at the insistence of Republicans, come 2014 and 2016, Republicans will wage campaign attacks against Democrats for having cut Social Security. But with Republicans so insistent, and a few Democrats wobbly on the issue, New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler says that ""If you go in and decide to fix sequestration, how much longer can you exempt entitlements. It's difficult to do if you want to get bipartisan agreement.""
This is the fight. Can Republicans protect tax subsidies for oil companies by cutting Social Security benefits for seniors? Are Democrats going to make that deal? If Americans don't want Social Security cut—and they don't, even if politicians are calling it ""chained CPI"" and pretending it's not really a cut—that needs to be crystal clear to Congress and the president.
Tell Congress it's time to end tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy.

If health insurance prices triple, do we still have to call Obamacare the “Affordable Care Act”? 
A report released yesterday by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reveals the devastating reality many Americans will face when Obamacare is in full force next year. While the majority of Americans will likely see their healthcare premiums increase, no one will swallow the cost burden more than young Americans.
Previous studies have reported that youth healthcare premiums could increase as much as 45 percent, but the the House Committee report concluded that young Americans could see an increase as much as 203 percent.
“Recent college graduates with entry-level jobs who are struggling to pay off student loan debt could see their premiums increase on average between 145 and 189 percent,” the report said. “Some studies estimate young adults could experience premium increases as high as 203 percent. Any increase, let alone tripling current costs, could break the bank for young adults who have just started out on their own.”
The current average payment for health care premiums among young Americans is $648, but will increase to $1,872 under the Obamacare legislation. The graph below breaks down the average increases in healthcare premiums for young Americans in major cities:
 
According to the report, young Americans are disproportionately affected by Obamacare for three reasons:
Families will also see a significant increase in their healthcare premiums. One of the studies in the report found that a family could see the costs of their premiums rise to $7,186 in the next decade. 
With a stagnant economy, unprecedented levels of unemployment (youth unemployment currently 17.6 percent), and average household expenses on the rise (gas, food, energy, etc), there are very few people that can afford $800-$4,000 more to pay for the rise in healthcare premiums. 
Remember when President Obama said, “if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan”? Or that Obamacare would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family.” Me too.

In a poll released Tuesday, one day after President Obama slammed Republicans for what he dishonestly described as a “government shutdown,” Rasmussen has found that when it comes to cutting health care costs, a majority of 51% favor “having a partial government shutdown until Democrats and Republicans agree on what spending for the health care law to cut.”
An even higher number of 53% favor a partial government shutdown until “Democrats and Republicans can agree on what [general] spending to cut.” Only 37% oppose. 
For obvious reasons, the media refuse to make clear that it is not the GOP proposing any kind of government shutdown, partial or otherwise. The GOP’s plan is to kill the ObamaCare debacle with a bill that funds everything but the president’s job-killing health care plan. It is up to the president and Democrat-led Senate, then, to decide if this wildly unpopular drag on our economy is worth shutting down the government. 
Both the media and the president are eager for this showdown; both relish the idea of replaying the 1990s when the media and the Clinton White House worked together to bludgeon then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich over a similar gambit. 
This poll, though, shows that this tactic might not work as well this time. Just for starters, people are much more concerned about the deficit today than they were in the mid-nineties; and there was no boondoggle like ObamaCare hanging out there as a prize in a shutdown showdown. 
Make no mistake, the media will ignore this poll. The results do not fit the media’s pro-ObamaCare Narrative, and only interferes with the reality they are attempting to manufacture that says a shutdown can only mean disaster for the GOP.
But to those interested in reality, this poll should be food for thought.

Doctor Walker is ready for you.



Doctor Walker is ready for you.

Scott Walkers #1, #2, and #3 top concerns have always been the same:  Scott Walker.
In elected office nearly his entire adult life, he has used each office he's held exclusively as a stepping stone to his next elected office.  Well known for rewarding donors and continually inflicting as much damage as possible as possible on those he identifies as  enemies, Walker has amassed a zealous following among the most ideological Republican voters by resorting to the most petty politics imaginable.
Sitting in the Wisconsin State Legislature, he leapt on the opportunity to become Milwaukee County Executive in a recall election (yes, you read that right) when residents of Milwaukee County became angry at a pension deal that mainly benefitted the County Exec and several long-serving members of the Board of Supervisors.  RW hate radio and the Republican-loving Milwaukee corporate media fanned the flames and paved the way for Walker.  The rest is history.  Walker won the recall.
As Milwaukee County Executive, Walker began to travel the state (at county taxpayer expense, of course) to increase his name recognition.  His next office, naturally, would be state-wide since he was already at the top of the heap in the Milwaukee area.  He cut taxes for business, pummeled Milwaukee County labor unions, squeezed public services to near extinction, shifted money out of building maintenance, privatized as many jobs as he could (ultimately costing the county millions in lawsuits), was relentless in reducing social programs, and made use of his Milwaukee County staff and facilities for political purposes including the installation and use of a secret router and private email accounts to circumvent public records laws.
In short, he didn't manage his public duties as much as use elected office for politicking for his next job.   Poor bashing, union bashing, and dog whistle blowing are very attractive to Republican voters and tossing in a blind hatred of taxes appeals to far too many independents and low information voters.
The governors seat was hardly even warm from the heat of his butt when he unveiled the most horrific legislation possible.  Taking nearly a billion dollars out of public schools, slashing state shared revenue to local governments, virtually abolishing unions for every public employee in the entire state whose union didn't endorse him in the election, slashing programs for the disabled, extreme reductions in state public assistance and health programs along with, of course, massive tax reductions (to business) led tens of thousands of normally politically sleepy Wisconsinites to surround the State Capitol for weeks.
He knew something would happen so he made sure to activate the Wisconsin National Guard.  His attempt to use them as his palace guard or goon squad fell flat due to the good leadership of the Guard.  I doubt he imagined the full extent of public pushback at his extremism.  No doubt he and his staff had to order super sized containers of Poop-B-Gone to get the stains out of their underwear that first week, but Walker just loved the attention of the media as could be seen at his 2-3 pressers he held every day.
He became a national Republican Super Star and loved every minute of it.  I'm surprised he could control the drool of anticipation at his next political office.  Forget running for Herb Kohls Senate seat;  he was becoming popular enough to run for President!  He knew exactly how to lure extremist Republican primary voters and doubled down on the crazy laws he signed into office no matter how many times the courts smacked down those laws as Unconstitutional.  
Campaign donors loved him and funneled plenty of payola into his coffers to enable him to put out tons of ads during the protests to promote his ""concerns for the taxpayer"" and bash protesters.  A hundred million dollars flowed into his hands through the end of the recall election and that doesn't even count the ads run by Koch-funded groups like Americans for (the Koch Brothers) Prosperity and similar astroturfs.
Republicans love Scott Walker.


But the RWNJs are a fickle lot.  They demand continual demonstrations of ideological purity and Walker is more than happy to oblige them.  Mandatory vaginal ultrasounds, concealed weapons carry, opening state forests and parks to hunting (hikers and picnickers beware!  Blam, blam, blam - you looked like Bambi), more welfare cuts, expansion of taxpayer funds for private and home school, more union bashing - the list goes on and on.  
And, of course, ObamaCare.  Every good Republican has to hate the Affordable Care Act.
Walker has doubled down on his public displays of ObamaCare hatred.  
Despite the requests of his benefactors and lobbyists for the health care and health insurance industries, Walker has refused to expand Medicaid or establish state exchanges for the Affordable Care Act even though some of his fellow extremist Republican Governors like Rick Snyder, Rick Scott and John Kasich have reluctantly accepted the hundreds of millions of federal aid.  NOT Scott Walker (he's running for President, you know) whose current state budget has tossed thousands off Medicaid.
Why? “To sabotage the Affordable Care Act and get political credit for that from the far right and parlay that into his run for president,” said Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin.
Kraig said Walker doesn’t want Democrats getting credit for something that represents “a huge step forward in the history of economic security in the United States, because there’s going to be – for the first time – a backup system where everyone can buy health care.”
So to build up his far-right cred and national profile as he prepares to run for his party’s 2016 presidential nomination, Walker has broken with other governors in his party and will turn his back on some $12 billion in funding through the ACA that would have all but eliminated the waiting list for insurance for the poor and working families who have their Medicaid payments delivered through the BadgerCare program.
To ensure that the poor people of Wisconsin will suffer when the ACA begins enrollment, Walker’s biennial budget made major changes to BadgerCare. Counting on public ignorance, he’ll attempt to position the problem as a consequence of the ACA.

(bolding is mine)
To placate his donors for the losses they'll incur as less patients are insured, Walker and his GOP band of Not So Merry Men are giving hospitals more than $73 million in taxpayer money.  
Yes, you read that right.  Refuse those federal funds and just use state taxpayer money instead.  After all, hatred of the ACA is what this is all about and common sense, basic math, citizen health, and job creation don't factor in.  He's running for President, you know.
Despite Walkers plans, non-profit organizations are stepping in to help Wisconsinites (particularly those losing Medicaid, which now, in Walkers latest budget, requires incomes at or below the poverty level, called BadgerCare in Wisconsin) navigate the federal health insurance exchanges that, despite Walkers very serious obstacles, are coming online October 1.
The most sickening tactics are in full use:
Besides making it difficult for people to acquire coverage under the ACA, Walker and other Republican leaders have been criticized for promoting false statistics to scare people into avoiding the ACA. The Cap Times reported last month that anonymous emails were being circulated claiming that if medical tests prove to be flawed, the ACA will not pay for retesting; that the only pain medication covered under Obamacare is aspirin and that people on Medicare will lose the right to choose their own doctors.
Republicans have focused a lot of their efforts to sabotage the ACA on young people, who are being hit with pleas not to sign up for health care coverage, as required under the “individual mandate” provision in the law. GOP leaders believe that by keeping young, healthy people from joining the system, they can make it fail by limiting the risk pool only to the sick and elderly.
At the beginning of September, Walker’s administration was condemned for releasing a phony analysis that tried to terrify consumers with the specter of dramatic premium rate increases under the ACA. But the analysis didn’t take into account federal tax subsidies, which are expected to lower premium costs as much as 77 percent. It also failed to show the comparative costs related to the benefits or co-pays under different policies.
When asked by media to provide the premium costs on which the projected percentage increases were based, the administration refused to release the numbers and then later admitted that the increases were not based on actual numbers.

(bolding is mine)
Walkers big political gamble is going to lose.  Yes, he's all over the country fundraising and pressing the flesh with supporters, but his future ambitions are well out of his reach.  As the exchanges come online, people access health coverage (some for the first time), and the new insurance policies activate on January 1, people are going to LOVE ObamaCare.  
And Republicans who blocked, obstructed, lied, and scared people are going to lose.  Big time.

Following the report that Insurer Humana was fined $65,000 in Kentucky for sending out 6,500 misleading cancellation letters for low-premiums plans only to be automatic re-enrollment in high cost plans before these customers were given a chance to shop on the open exchange for a better and cheaper plan - we now have a new report that Anthem Blue Cross is being sued for tricking people into dropping their ""grandfathered"" plans.
Think that's bad, well this is even worse.
http://thinkprogress.org/...
“Blue Cross successfully enticed tens of thousands of its individual policyholders to switch out of their grandfathered health plans and forever lose their protected grandfathered status,” states the lawsuit. “Blue Cross concealed information about the consequences of switching plans and intentionally misled its policyholders to encourage the replacement of grandfathered policies.”
And more... http://www.ibtimes.com/...
The lawsuits, filed Monday in Superior Court, may signal an emerging customer pushback against the approximately 900,000 cancellations in California alone of individual health insurance policies that will take effect Dec. 31.
900,00 Cancellations.  False Cancellations of plans that, which under the Affordable Care Act are ""Grandfathered"" and Don't Need to be Cancelled.  The Insurance Companies are doing it to Scam their Customers into higher cost plans and away from the ACA Exchanges in a practice that violates State Law known as ""Twisting"".



The plaintiffs, Paul Simon, 39, and Catherine Corker, 63, of California say that they are among the customers that Anthem Blue Cross pressured to drop their grandfathered policies in 2011 without giving them all the facts about new Obamacare requirements that could raise the price of their plans in an effort to cut its own costs. Simon and Corker would have preferred to remain on the grandfathered plans permitted by the law, and are now asking the courts to block Anthem from canceling any more policies unless the company allows consumers to switch back into their grandfathered plans.
“This is about an insurance company manipulating the situation and concealing the facts,” said William Shernoff, an attorney for both the plaintiffs, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “We are asking the court to give our clients and everybody else in the same situation the option of going back to their grandfathered policies.”

These lawsuits may take some time to work their way through the court system, but what can work even more quickly is the CA State Insurance Commission and also the Court of public opinion.  Just like in Kentucky the CA Commission has the ability and power to Restore These Improperly Cancelled Plans and get customers back the ""Plan they Prefer"" if that's what they truly want.
Perhaps if a few (thousand) of the customers who received letters claiming their ""grandfathered"" plan was cancelled were to contact that commissioners office, there might be some action on this faster rather than later.

Throughout the Obama administration, our dangerously incurious, acquiescent media have been collectively caught off guard by every White House scandal, from Benghazi to the IRS to “you can keep your insurance.” Each and every time, the media ignored conservatives who warned in advance of what was happening. But the next unexploded scandal — a nuclear bomb in ObamaCare — is an opportunity for the media to redeem itself.
Thursday, Forbes reported that the Obama administration knew in 2010 that by the time the dust settles, 93 million Americans will lose their insurance due to ObamaCare. This time, instead of being caught off guard and surprised by something that is an open secret, maybe the media can get ahead of this story before it is too late — if it isn’t already:
Section 1251 of the Affordable Care Act contains what’s called a “grandfather” provision that, in theory, allows people to keep their existing plans if they like them. But subsequent regulations from the Obama administration interpreted that provision so narrowly as to prevent most plans from gaining this protection.
“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small employer plans and 45 percent of large employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” wrote the administration on page 34,552 of the Register. All in all, more than half of employer-sponsored plans will lose their “grandfather status” and get canceled. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 156 million Americans–more than half the population–was covered by employer-sponsored insurance in 2013.
Another 25 million people, according to the CBO, have “nongroup and other” forms of insurance; that is to say, they participate in the market for individually-purchased insurance. In this market, the administration projected that “40 to 67 percent” of individually-purchased plans would lose their Obamacare-sanctioned “grandfather status” and get canceled, solely due to the fact that there is a high turnover of participants and insurance arrangements in this market. (Plans purchased after March 23, 2010 do not benefit from the “grandfather” clause.) The real turnover rate would be higher, because plans can lose their grandfather status for a number of other reasons.
How many people are exposed to these problems? 60 percent of Americans have private-sector health insurance–precisely the number that Jay Carney dismissed. As to the number of people facing cancellations, 51 percent of the employer-based market plus 53.5 percent of the non-group market (the middle of the administration’s range) amounts to 93 million Americans.
Dear Media: This is science, math, and law. How about digging in a little bit on this one? Because it is coming and we all know it.

The brilliant Charles Pierce perfectly punctures the MSM's fluffery of the opening of Dubya's Museum:
The elite press is dedicating an entire day of coverage to the perpetuation of a monstrous public lie. Electing George W. Bush twice was a monumental act of democratic self-destruction from which the country has yet to recover. Celebrating him celebrating himself is simply to pour battery acid into the still-open wounds.
In order to take in the ginormous magnitude of Dubya's project to destroy the American Dream, ponder this simple question -- what if he'd done nothing? Follow me below the fold for this speculation...


WHAT IF...Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld had done nothing, and allowed Richard Clarke & Company to continue their pursuit of Osama bin Laden? What if Bush had paid attention to those warnings (as Clinton did)? 9-11 might well have been averted.
WHAT IF...Bush had valued what he inherited -- a balanced budget -- and DONE NOTHING. No massive tax cuts benefiting the top 1/10th of 1 percent. No massive deficits. 8 years -- budget still balanced, instead of trillions in new debt and a tax code designed to make the government untenable without savaging the social safety net.
WHAT IF...Bush had treated FEMA as a serious agency with a vital role to play in national emergencies? What if he'd appointed a serious administrator, instead of an incompetent crony bent on looting the agency and wrecking its ability to function properly? Katrina might have turned out quite differently.
WHAT IF...Bush had hadn't worked overtime to destroy the regulation of financial markets? What if he'd DONE NOTHING, and let regulatory agencies do their proper work? The financial crash of 2007-8 might never have happened.
WHAT IF...most importantly...Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld hadn't conjured stove-piped ""intel"" to stampede us into war after 9-11? No trillion dollar wars, shoveled onto the spiraling national debt...no thousands of American soldiers killed...no hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed...no Abu Ghraib...no disillusionment of the American public in our ability to fight and win wars...
What always struck me about Bush and his incompetent cronies is the activist nature of their ""wreck everything quickly"" administration. All Bush had to do was NOTHING to have a successful presidency. Everything he touched turned (immediately) to shit...and yet he couldn't wait to destroy more. Thank goodness the American people turned on him during the post 2004 ""Wind At My Back"" ""Hand Social Security Over To Wall Street"" debacle.
I'm convinced that someday, 50 years from now when historians are analyzing the moment that ""broke the back"" of the American dream, they'll focus on the Bush Administration -- specifically the catastrophic response to 9/11. Karl Rove's goal was always to repeal the New Deal, monkey-wrench the government to make it untenable, and hand the burning wreckage over to his billionaire pals who are greatly inconvenienced by all those middle class ""entitlements"", environmental protections and Union rights.
All he had to do was nothing. Instead, he almost wrecked everything

And you know, what — and that can be on the plus side where furloughs may take place a little later or on the minus side, where things may be more immediate.
Watch the video to see how heated it got. More proof Henry is a great reporter. 
Though they are more than capable of going overboard at times, the media-at-large does a very good job of vetting and holding Republicans accountable. What Ed Henry just did used to happen practically every day to the White House press secretary between the years of 2001 and 2009. Moreover, there were frequent gang tackles where members of the White House press corps would coordinate to ensure a question got answered. 
I didn’t hear anyone jumping in to help Henry, did you?
And these lapdogs wonder why Obama treats them like one-night stands.

The brilliant Charles Pierce perfectly punctures the MSM's fluffery of the opening of Dubya's Museum:
The elite press is dedicating an entire day of coverage to the perpetuation of a monstrous public lie. Electing George W. Bush twice was a monumental act of democratic self-destruction from which the country has yet to recover. Celebrating him celebrating himself is simply to pour battery acid into the still-open wounds.
In order to take in the ginormous magnitude of Dubya's project to destroy the American Dream, ponder this simple question -- what if he'd done nothing? Follow me below the fold for this speculation...


WHAT IF...Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld had done nothing, and allowed Richard Clarke & Company to continue their pursuit of Osama bin Laden? What if Bush had paid attention to those warnings (as Clinton did)? 9-11 might well have been averted.
WHAT IF...Bush had valued what he inherited -- a balanced budget -- and DONE NOTHING. No massive tax cuts benefiting the top 1/10th of 1 percent. No massive deficits. 8 years -- budget still balanced, instead of trillions in new debt and a tax code designed to make the government untenable without savaging the social safety net.
WHAT IF...Bush had treated FEMA as a serious agency with a vital role to play in national emergencies? What if he'd appointed a serious administrator, instead of an incompetent crony bent on looting the agency and wrecking its ability to function properly? Katrina might have turned out quite differently.
WHAT IF...Bush had hadn't worked overtime to destroy the regulation of financial markets? What if he'd DONE NOTHING, and let regulatory agencies do their proper work? The financial crash of 2007-8 might never have happened.
WHAT IF...most importantly...Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld hadn't conjured stove-piped ""intel"" to stampede us into war after 9-11? No trillion dollar wars, shoveled onto the spiraling national debt...no thousands of American soldiers killed...no hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed...no Abu Ghraib...no disillusionment of the American public in our ability to fight and win wars...
What always struck me about Bush and his incompetent cronies is the activist nature of their ""wreck everything quickly"" administration. All Bush had to do was NOTHING to have a successful presidency. Everything he touched turned (immediately) to shit...and yet he couldn't wait to destroy more. Thank goodness the American people turned on him during the post 2004 ""Wind At My Back"" ""Hand Social Security Over To Wall Street"" debacle.
I'm convinced that someday, 50 years from now when historians are analyzing the moment that ""broke the back"" of the American dream, they'll focus on the Bush Administration -- specifically the catastrophic response to 9/11. Karl Rove's goal was always to repeal the New Deal, monkey-wrench the government to make it untenable, and hand the burning wreckage over to his billionaire pals who are greatly inconvenienced by all those middle class ""entitlements"", environmental protections and Union rights.
All he had to do was nothing. Instead, he almost wrecked everything

The Obama Administration has decided to block access to public memorials on the National Mall as a result of the government shutdown. Like its decision to end White House tours when the sequester cuts took effect, there is no rational reason for this. The Park Police, nominally in charge of monitoring these spaces, isn’t even affected by the shutdown. Shutting off access to these sites is gratuitous and petulant. 
On Monday, the first day of the government shutdown, a number of WWII veterans showed up at a memorial to their service to find that access had been blocked. The memorial is in a public space and is open 24/7, with almost no oversight from Park Police personnel. (Who, by the way, are exempt from the government shutdown.) The White House was, according to reports, informed of the veterans’ visit and chose to block access.
Having lived in DC for 18 years, I can tell you, the WWII Memorial is simply an architectural structure in an open public space. There is no official “access” to it. There are no guards. It’s a building in a park. Yet, the Obama Administration tried to block veterans from viewing the public memorial, even after hearing about the planned visit. 
Fortunately, the “greatest generation” was having nothing of this and easily overcame the government barricades. (Do we yet again have to rely on this generation to show the promise of America?) 
On Wednesday, the veterans’ group is planning to visit the Lincoln Memorial, which the Obama Administration has also vowed to close to visitors. I have regularly visited this memorial at one or two in the morning. At those hours, it is a peaceful and reflective place. It is an open space. There is no access that needs to be blocked. It is only by a conscious decision, and a great deal of work, that access would be blocked. 
This is nothing more than a petulant response by the Obama Administration to the government shutdown. Over the next week, more than 500 WWII veterans are expected in DC to visit the memorial dedicated to their sacrifice. If the Park Police again try to erect barricades to this public space, it will be another sign that the Obama Administration has made an affirmative decision to separate itself from the American public. 
Obama chose this pass. He ought to be made to own it.  "
90,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/22/GOP-suspends-constitution-in-debt-fight,News,Breitbart,Democrat,GOP 'Suspends' Constitution in Debt Fight,"

In legislation filed yesterday, the House GOP Leadership made an important twist in their plan to pass a short-term increase in the debt ceiling. Rather than increase the debt ceiling by a few hundred billion dollars, buying them time for further talks on the budget, they have opted to “suspend” the debt ceiling. Its a blatant abdication of their constitutional authority. It’s an ominous sign of the talks to come. 
Article 1 of the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to borrow money to fund the government. Up until World War I, Congress would approve every bond issuance. The borrowing demands of the war made this impractical, so Congress authorized a “debt ceiling,” where the government could freely borrow up to a statutory limit and then go back to Congress to approve additional borrowing. Think of it as giving your teenager a pre-paid debit card. 
With this measure, the government had more flexibility to manage its affairs while preserving the Constitutional principle that Congress controlled the purse strings. 
“Suspending” the debt ceiling until May upends this principle. Upon enactment, the government’s borrowing authority would be unlimited until May. Presumably, the government could borrow trillions in this window, providing either the markets or the Fed would meet the new supply of debt. 
Worse, however, is that the GOP move establishes a very slippery precedent. The left has been agitating to simply eliminate the idea of a debt ceiling entirely. For all its flaws, the ceiling at least guarantees we will have some debate about government spending. The left finds this annoying. Unfortunately, the GOP plan to “suspend” the ceiling provides at least partial support to this argument. If we can “suspend” it for three months, why not a year? Once you’ve surrendered the constitutional principle behind the ceiling where and how can you draw a line? 
Despite their past history of punting on difficult fiscal issues, I was willing to give the House GOP a skeptical benefit of the doubt on their plan for a short-term lift in the ceiling. The deficit debate has three components, ie. debt ceiling, sequestration, and budget expiration, which happen close to each other, but not simultaneously. It made some strategic sense to weave them together into a single debate. 
I assumed, however, that this would entail an increase in the debt ceiling of a few hundred billion dollars, to provide the time to negotiate a longer-term deal. I did not anticipate it would feature the House GOP surrendering its constitutional obligations. 
When the GOP took control of the House, they vowed that every piece of legislation would contain specific language citing the constitutional authority for the proposed law. It would be interesting to see their interpretation of the constitutional authority to suspend the document.

Rep. Randy Neugebauer, today's Worst Congressman in America (NBC News)



Rep. Randy Neugebauer, today's Worst Congressman in America (NBC News)


Is there some damn law that says congressional Republicans have to be assholes? Is ""not being a gigantic prick to anyone you meet"" one of the now-countless things that will get you kicked out of the party? Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-TX, because of course he is), come on down. Show the little people how being a grandstanding self-important ass is done.
In an astounding confrontation that took place yesterday at the World War II Memorial in DC, a Tea Party congressman from Texas appeared to blame the Park Service for denying veterans access to the facility — and then made a Park Ranger apologize for the shutdown. ""How do you look at them and ... deny them access?"" Rep. Randy Neugebauer asked the unidentified Ranger in an incredible exchange that was caught on camera by NBC Washington.
Are you… are you stupid? Do you honestly think that the problem with shutting down all the quote-nonessential-unquote functions of the entire United States government is that the first Park Ranger you meet was probably in on it? She wasn't in on it! You were in the meetings where it was decided who would be in on it! You, Mr. Neugebaur, raised your stubby little hand and declared you were in on it!
""It's difficult,"" the Ranger replied. ""Well, it should be difficult,"" scorned the congressman. ""It is difficult,"" the Ranger repeated. ""I'm sorry, sir.""
""The Park Service should be ashamed of themselves,"" said Neugebauer. ""I'm not ashamed,"" the Ranger retorted.
""You should be,"" sneered Neugebauer.

More on Rep. Neugebaur below the fold.



Are you even paying the Park Ranger you're sneering at, while demanding she personally and for free keep a monument open that you yourself closed? What is this, an asshole boss competition? Do you realize that they in fact let the veterans in even though you closed the monument, even though they do not get to set up a little podium and hold a press conference in which they publicly masturbate over their great patriotism in doing so? Do you realize how many citizens witnessing this event were contemplating whether it would be worth jail time to just punch you?
The good news is that the ordinary citizens nearby, who are not the press and who are not obligated to treat Randy Neugebauer Being An Asshole as quite literally just another day at the park, came to the Ranger's defense.
At that point, a crowd of onlookers got involved. ""Ask those questions of the people who aren't passing the budget,"" shouted a voice from the crowd. ""That's who you need to ask these questions to.""
""This woman is doing her job, just like me,"" shouted another. ""I'm a 30-year federal veteran -- I'm out of work.""

Rep. Neugebauer protested a bit, then quickly ran off to buy himself an even bigger flag for his pocket. Good God, man, just get out. Get out of the memorial, get out of the government, get out anything that does not involve you walling yourself up in a hillside bunker. The entire Texas Republican caucus needs to throw themselves in the Potomac—the Park Service will fish each of you out again when they are good and goddamn ready.

The evidence could not be stronger. Over 30 years have passed since Reagan laid out the Republican economic agenda. It was simple and people wanted to believe. Keep government out of peoples lives and let them keep what they earn. Government is the problem. Make things easy for business to flourish by loosening regulations and lowering their taxes because if business can flourish all will benefit as their profits will ""trickle down"" to bring prosperity to all.

Fast forward to the present; after more than 30 years of Republican political dominance, the results of Republican/conservative policies are all too apparent. The free market supply side forces have been responsible for creating the greatest income disparity since the gilded age. The United States has lost ground internationally in most demonstrable criteria including: median income, access to health care, infant mortality and economic dominance. And the Republican era of power culminated in an economic free fall which cost the American economy $12.8 trillion dollars and 8 million jobs. The failure of the republican/conservative economic agenda is stunning in its totality.
But there is nowhere the Republican failure is more devastating than in the global response to climate change.
Continue below the fold to read more about the cost of this conservative obstruction.


At the end of World War II the United States emerged as the world leader economically and politically. The advantages and responsibilities of world leadership was in our hands. We built on the New Deal to strengthen the middle class with Social Security and Medicare and then focused on human rights with the Civil Rights Act. Then in 1981 came the Reagan revolution. And in a symbolic act President Reagan took down the solar panels which had been installed on the Carter White House. This act symbolized that new guys were in town and it also meant that government was being pushed out of the way for business to take its place as the rightful representative of the American people.
That was about the same time that understanding about our species' contribution to climate warming was being discussed in the global scientific community. It was already recognized that our industrial consumption based on fossil fuels was the leading cause of our atmospheric pollution. It was also recognized that global warming would require a global response, with nations working together to advance and implement solutions. Our global economic and political leadership placed us in a position of responsibility to the global challenge of climate change; but here is where we abdicated our global leadership responsibility and the Republican ideology of laissez faire collided with the needed response to our changing climate.

In the over 30 years of Republican political dominance, the evidence of anthropogenic climate change has only strengthened to the point that 97 percent of credible climate scientists support the overwhelming evidence of human caused climate change. Yet over that time the Republican/conservative response has been to use its power to misinform and to obstruct any progress to mitigate. The Republican political leaders have taken the side of their business buddies—the fossil fuel industry, who have rewarded them with obnoxious sums of money for their support which has assured them of unrivaled control of the energy market. In the 112th GOP-controlled congress alone there have been 317 votes taken against the environment.
The cost of this obstruction and misinformation? It increasingly looks like the cost the world will be paying for this idiotic political malfeasance is a safe future for our children and grandchildren. We have lost too much time in implementing solutions and already many in the world especially the most vulnerable are on the road to mass suffering and hunger.
Republicans: The blood is on your hands.

Pew polling on issues



Pew polling on issues

Pew:

Move in a more conservative or moderate direction on policy? By 54% to 40%, Republican and Republican-leaning voters want the party’s leaders to move further to the right. Not surprisingly, conservatives and those who agree with the Tea Party overwhelmingly favor moving in a more conservative direction, while moderates and liberals would like to see the party take more centrist positions. Yet the more moderate wing of the party is a minority generally, and makes up an even smaller share of the likely primary electorate.
So long as moderates don't vote in GOP primaries, we're stuck with the nut cases. (And I love the chart on compromise. Definitive, eh?)
Nate Cohn:
The composition of the Republican primary electorate makes the challenge even greater. In the Pew poll, 49 percent of Republicans who participate in every primary support the tea party—just 22 percent consider themselves moderate. In last year’s primaries, evangelical Christians represented more than 40 percent of the electorate in just about every major contest, including relatively moderate Romney states like Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Florida.
More politics and policy below the fold.



Dana Milbank:
House Republicans, in their final days at work before taking a five-week vacation, have come out with a new agenda: “Stop Government Abuse.”
A more candid slogan might be: “Stop Government.”

Brian Beutler:
Republicans have dealt with some embarrassing moments on the House floor over the past year, but none so revealing or damning as today’s snafu, when they yanked a bill to fund the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. Even the recent farm bill fiasco wasn’t as damning an indictment of the GOP’s governing potential.
It may seem like a minor hiccup, or a symbolic failure. But it spells doom for the party’s near-term budget strategy and underscores just how bogus the party’s broader agenda really is and has been for the last four years.

Ron Fournier claims that the only measurement of leadership is success. GOP obstructionism is irrelevant:
[Ezra] Klein is right about this: No president is a superhero. First, as Klein suggests, the U.S. political system faces enormous structural problems that make leadership challenging for any president. Chief among them is sophisticated redistricting that has helped create a polarized Congress packed with lawmakers with no incentive to compromise. Second, government austerity reduces the president's ability to bargain with Congress. Third, the democratization of politics—and of big money in particular—has weakened the party structures. That has weakened a president's powers that stem from his role as the titular party chief. Finally, the modern GOP is less willing than Democrats to compromise. There is something to Obama's complaint that virtually any policy he supports will be met by resistance.
But none of these are excuses for failure. Presidential leadership (or the lack of it) still makes an enormous difference.

@ThePlumLineGS @ron_fournier I think Ron errs in not singling out the House, Senate's a different story where compromise is possible.

Greg Sargent demurs:
If anything, it’s punditry such as Fournier’s that constitutes a surrender of sorts. It’s not enough to claim Obama’s legacy will inevitably seen as a failure  to overcome GOP intransigence (should that happen), because history isn’t fair. The question is, should that be the case, and would blaming Obama for failing to overcome it be a reasonable and accurate assessment? Fournier, in effect, is giving up on the pundit’s ability to engage this question forthrightly and directly, and by extension, on his ability to influence public and elite perceptions of what’s happening. Fournier regularly derides “partisans” on both sides of this argument. But the refusal to apportion blame accurately — when the facts plainly merit assigning it overwhelmingly to one side, and not the other — is itself a form of partisanship and bias that impairs judgment and, in the end, misleads readers.

And after this $1.3 trillion boondoggle fueled skyrocketing inequality and blasted a gaping hole in the budget we would be left with a once-in-a-half-century financial crisis that would leave America borrowing more than a trillion dollars a year?

...and I thought to myself, ""No way! Not even Mitt Romney could say something that dumb."" But David Corn is the guy who broke the whole 47 percent thing in the first place, so I clicked. And sure enough:
[Washington Post Reporter Dan] Balz tried to point this out: ""But when you said there are 47 percent who won't take personal responsibility—."" Romney interrupted: ""Actually, I didn’t say that... That's how it began to be perceived, and so I had to ultimately respond to the perception, because perception is reality.""
Gee, Mitt, where could that perception possibly have come from? Perhaps the simple fact that it's exactly what you said?
There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what… These are people who pay no income tax. [...] My job is is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.
It'd be one thing if Mitt Romney apologized for his comments—or if he defended them. But pretending that he never even said them in the first place? That's like saying that not only does he believe 47 percent of Americans are lazy freeloaders who refuse to take personal responsibility for themselves, they—along with the rest of Americans—are stupid idiots who would trust Romney's revisionism over their lying eyes. Well, in this case eyes and ears.

The demographic winter of white America is at hand, even as it began years ago for the native-born of old Europe.
Today, we look at their community response, below the fold.



""White Numbers Shrink,"" was the headline on the lead story in USA Today. ""More Whites Dying Than Being Born,"" blared The Wall Street Journal. What does this mean?
I'm guessing that it means white people don't have children unless they can afford to raise them...just a guess!

Brown people are so irresponsible! Then again, maybe voting for a party that is trying to expand economic opportunity, rather than restrict it to the top one percent, could help in that regard. Just a guess!
I have never seen a good answer to the following question: Why were the immigration laws changed in 1965 to favor Third World citizens, Asians and New world latinos while penalizing the ""old tribes"" from Europe, especially considering that this country's heritage is Eurocentric? Was this Teddy Kennedy and his Irish mafia's way to get back at the Brits? The country club set's distaste for those of us with Slavic backgrounds? Just wondering.
The Irish are a ""new tribe"" from Asia?
Who is surprised? For many years we have provided welfare for baby mommas and increased the black numbers and allowed Mexicans that make it across the border and Cubans who make it across the beach the same welfare for reproducing and thus increasing brown numbers. There always were more people of color than those of us whites on a worldwide basis. We were blessed by the Judeo Christian belief system that hard work and good morals would always triumph. And if not we had all the guns. Politicians have long been aware of this. Last year the child was born that in 18 years will tip the scale to majority voters of color. Then white folk will come to understand the true meaning of living in a minority world.
The Judeo Christian belief system includes a militarized enforcement clause?
egardless of the demographics, if the GOP would simply try to do this: Stop our out-of-control, big government, Unconstitutional welfare/warfare/police state. That means:
1. No more Federal welfare or ""entitlements"". Phase them all out & let the States take them over or modify them, if they want.
2. Recall the troops from 800+ bases in 120+ nations around the world. No more wars not officially declared by Congress.
3. Repeal the Patriot Act & NDAA & eliminate Homeland Security. Stop the NSA information gathering on innocent Americans. Give us back our Bill of Rights.
4. Balance the budget asap, return to Constitutional money (gold/silver) & get rid of the Federal Reserve.
If only Republicans adopted Ron Paul's platform, they'd win, just like Ron Paul did!
It's unbelievably frustrating to hear the same, tired claim that demographics will doom the GOP. That's completely wrong. It's poor communication that's dooming the GOP.
The GOP is the only major party that supports free market policies. And free market policies are THE means to empowerment. Any other system inevitably leads to more poverty.
TEACH PEOPLE THIS FACT AND THEY WILL VOTE FOR YOU.
I started a Facebook page a few weeks ago called Unbiased America that is trying to do just that. I do my best to bring people from all sides of the political spectrum in to discuss ideas and policies the childish demagoguery and name-calling that usually happens when the left and right get together.

Seven percent of America's growth in 2012 came from white people. A total of 93 percent came from Asians, African Americans and Latinos. If I was a racist conservatives, I'd be frustrated too.
But speaking of ""poor communication that's dooming the GOP"":
I went to a top 20 university and have an advanced degree-- I GET your points.
But lower aptitude American blacks and Hispanics want free stuff. They have PERNICIOUS social pathologies-- they drop out of school and get pregnant at prodigious rates...hearing about how the educated and game can do well in a free market of competition means NOTHING to them.
Multiple theories of free republics say that they are doomed to fail because the Left will simply demagogue with promised freebies.

""If only they weren't so stupid compared to us whites"" sure is great communication! If only Republicans were able to discuss the issue so freely, they wouldn't be so doomed.
As usual, Mr. Buchanan has hit the nail on the head. 50 years from now, America as we know it will not exist. It will have been replaced by a polyglot of blacks, browns, yellows, and a few whites, who will be fortunate if they can survive, much less thrive, in the new environment. I grieve for my grand-son, who will have to cope with that situation.
Hmm, Scandinavia is out, all those socialists. Germany has too many brown-skinned Turks. France has too many Africans. And French things.
I'm thinking Russia is your grandchild's last hope.
White liberals think that by breeding out whites and continuing to bar them from immigrating to this country, they will remain as the great white lords of the land... LOL. Reality and history says different. With years of heavy third world legal immigration and millions of illegals with birthright citizenship, the balance may have tipped to the point of no return. The entire world should be fearful. No more will there be the once great USA to turn to in time of trouble. ""Diversity"" has increased the welfare state to the point of collapse. We knew the end was near when history was re-written and national pride was labeled ""offensive"" while foreign ""pride"" praised. No unity, no country.
100% of white growth in 2012 came from immigration. Actually, more than 100 percent, since more white people died in America than were born. So yeah, white liberals need to be better at keeping those European immigrants out. STAT!
Diversity didn't work for the Balkan nations and it isn't working here. It's a deliberate way to bring down this country to the level of the third world.
You know who else was into white supremacism? Yeah, that guy. Did that work?
That ""diversity is strength"" is just a gimmick schtick con job of the Left...deep down, those who love guvment KNOW that some ethnic groups will inexorably flock to guvment dependence, and the Left THRIVES on cultivating same. ILLEGAL aliens ARE undocumented democrats!
Asians almost never resort to welfare services, but Hispanics and blacks FLOCK to them. Factor in I.Q./aptitude and social pathology problems (proclivities to crimes, gangs, dropouts, teen and illegitimate pregnancies, neighborhood/barrio blight), and you see substantial correlations by ethnicity.
Europe is REELING WITH REGRET for having imported Islamists 'just to do our work for us."" Very soon, the imported populations will predominate. They are not lower aptitude, BUT their culture and religion are noxious and pernicious.

Asians vote more Democratic than Latinos. But the stereotypes say they're good at math, so all's good with those guys!
Guess it could be worse but I don't see how.
I always thought the election and re-election of Obama would bring nothing good and everything bad for America. But it was actually something much more tragic.
It was the beginning of the end of a once great country.

Everything was white but now there are more brown people. Somehow, I suspect you'll find a way to soldier on.
And more not easy answers include to stop feeding them [Latinos] literally. We need to stop giving them so much money in social welfare benefits. If they can survive on their own then fine. If they starve to death, then it will reduce the surplus population as Scrooge would say and i do not have a problem with that at all. When you keep feeding stray animals they reproduce a lot more and become totally dependent and bring their friends. That is what we have been doing in this country and it needs to stop. That will help take care of this issue.
I'm old enough to remember when conservatives actually tried to win elections.
And this has been the plan all along. No other coutries/continents besides Europe and America have been shamed and criticized into committing national suicide by letting in people from third world countries and of all different races in the name of multiculturalism and diversity. These are perverted Western ideas. Japan is for the Japanese, China for the Chinese, Korea for the Koreans, Africa for the Africans and so on. Only the US and Europe are for any third world vermin that wants to come here.
Interesting theory. So ... you're Native American?

Florida Republican Boy Wonder Marco Rubio is very upset about sequestration. His reason, as conveyed in an op-ed, seems to boil down to two words: Blue Angels.
For President Obama to continue the charade of making things like the Blue Angels the culprits of our debt and, therefore, the first thing on the chopping block when government must slim down is an insult to the American people.
The Blue Angels are relatively cheap! The savings could have been found elsewhere to preserve Americans' right to see military planes flying demonstrations! Why, why, why?
Oh, Rubio has room for a passing mention of some of sequestration's other inconveniences:
President Obama’s administration should be ashamed for trying to convince the American people that our only choices when it comes to dealing with the debt are either to leave government as big and bloated as it is, or accept a new reality where our people have to endure longer lines at the airport, endless flight delays, the loss of safety net medical assistance, the denial of education services, and many other inconveniences and negative effects to people’s day-to-day lives.
Umm, whut? As Rubio points out, he did vote against the Budget Control Act that produced the sequester. His reasoning was basically this: Slash Medicare, not the military budget, and OMG, what if this leads to tax increases? Well, we got sequestration rather than tax increases on the wealthy and corporations because Rubio's party wanted it that way. And now he's whining that President Obama is posing some kind of false choice between big government and flight delays, as if magical budget fairies are going to sneeze out the services people expect, want, and need from the government without it costing anything or requiring revenue.
Sequester effects that Rubio doesn't have room to mention: cuts to unemployment insurance checks, domestic violence programs, Meals on Wheels, national parks. Rubio doesn't spare a word for all the federal workers who are losing big chunks of their pay to furloughs. He spends more words on flight delays that Congress already acted to prevent than he does on Head Start cuts (if that's even one of the things he means by ""education services"") that are leaving low-income kids without preschool, teachers without jobs, and parents having to scramble to find child care if they're going to be able to keep their jobs or look for work. ""The loss of safety net medical assistance,"" meanwhile, is a nicely bloodless way to describe cuts to cancer treatment for Medicare patients.
The Blue Angels, though? Rubio has room for six full paragraphs about them.

(Reuters) – Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker proposed a nearly $70 billion biennial budget on Wednesday that combines income tax cuts with increased spending on transportation infrastructure and private education.
Walker, a first-term Republican facing re-election next year, said he would offset the tax cuts and spending increases contained in his 2013-2015 budget by redirecting some funds away from public schools and healthcare, freezing aid to local governments and selling off state assets such as power plants.
Democrats said the proposal would weaken the economic security of the state’s most vulnerable residents.
Walker, who touched off massive protests two years ago when he curbed the collective bargaining rights of public workers, said his proposed income tax cut would save residents $343 million.
“More money in the hands of taxpayers will likely drive greater demand for goods and services, which will likely lead to greater production and eventually more hiring of employees,” he said.
The proposed budget, unveiled in an address to both houses of the Legislature in Madison, included expanded state aid to private schools through voucher programs and the tightening of income eligibility requirements for recipients of publicly funded health programs.
Walker said he also wanted “able-bodied, non-elderly” people receiving food stamps in Wisconsin to be enrolled in mandatory employment training.
“I’m all for providing a temporary hand up,” he told lawmakers. “But … it should not be a permanent handout.
Democrats, who tried unsuccessfully last year to recall Walker, were critical of the proposed budget.
State Senator Kathleen Vinehout, who was a candidate for governor in the Democratic primary ahead of last year’s recall election, said, “Roads and bridges are being paid for by borrowing and raiding money that would otherwise go to schools and universities.
“These are political choices, not the choices voters in Wisconsin would make.”
Walker’s proposed budget will now go to the state Legislature, which is controlled by Walker’s fellow Republicans.
Debate on the measure is expected to continue for months.

President Barack Obama rarely makes himself available to the mainstream media. They adore him anyway. At rare press conferences, such as the one scheduled for noon Friday at the White House, they lob softball questions or accept his evasive, meandering answers, rarely pressing him for clarity, much less truth. But there are many questions that the president ought to answer, yet which he is unlikely to face at all.
10. In 2008 you promised not to “do an end-run around Congress” with signing statements. Yet you have used signing statements and you have taken executive actions to circumvent Congress on immigration and other issues. Recently, you decided the employer mandate will not be enforced on October 1. Yet that date is stipulated by law. Doesn’t the Obamacare delay violate your powers under the Constitution?
9. Last week we learned that dozens of CIA personnel were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, and that there may be ongoing efforts to suppress information about what actually happened. In October 2012, you said that you issued three directives when you learned of the attack, yet these have never been seen. What did you actually do during the Benghazi attack, and why weren’t you more actively involved?
8. Last month, IRS officials testified to Congress that IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins, whom you appointed, was directly involved in reviewing applications for non-profit status by Tea Party groups. He also met with you in April 2012, prior to issuing new “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) criteria for evaluating such applications. What was your personal knowledge of the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups?
7. Recently your administration launched a new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders. Israel had repeatedly said that it would negotiate without preconditions, but Palestinian leaders would not. Your administration, through Secretary of State John Kerry, pressed Israel to release 104 terrorists from Israeli jails. Was there a single new concession you demanded from Palestinians?
6. You have publicly dressed down the U.S. military on the issue of sexual assault. In the 2012 campaign, you were very involved in specific controversies, even calling Sandra Fluke, for example. Yet you have refused to say anything about the conduct of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego, who refuses to resign. Aren’t you setting a bad example on sexual assault, as commander-in-chief, in the Filner case?
5. Edward Snowden has continued to reveal new information about the National Security Agency’s abilities to gather information about Americans’ private communications. Leaving aside the question of whether the government should have that power, or whether you have broken past promises on civil liberties, the fact that these leaks happened at all is striking. Why is Gen. Keith Alexander still the head of the NSA?
4. Recently you announced that you were canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Snowden issue and gay rights. Yet last month, even after Putin indicated he might offer Snowden asylum, you were still offering drastic cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal. It looks like the “reset” with Russia is a failure, after so many concessions. Isn’t it time to stop offering new cuts to U.S. nuclear weapons?
3. You are backing the Senate immigration bill, which passed because Democrats agreed to include border security measures. Regardless of whether those measures are sufficient, they depend on a commitment to enforce the law as written. Yet you have refused to enforce existing immigration laws, even imposing a so-called “Dream Act” by fiat. Why should Americans trust you to enforce a new immigration law?
2. You campaigned on the promise to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet you have helped the Taliban open a new office in Qatar, complicating relations with President Hamid Karzai, and recently suggested that there could be a “zero option” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, as the U.S. withdraws, Al Qaeda is on the offensive across the region, and might return. Are we not repeating the mistakes of the past in Afghanistan?
1. You are about to head into a new round of budget negotiations. Some Republicans leaders have suggested that they are willing to offer concessions on the budget sequester if you commit to entitlement reform. You have spoken in theory about making some cuts but have never presented a plan, on paper, and have rejected all suggestions, even the Simpson-Bowles commission. Where is your plan to reform entitlements?
Bonus question: Last month, you spoke at length about how the African-American community views the death of Trayvon Martin case. You also asked people to respect the decision of the jury. Yet your Department of Justice is still aggressively investigating George Zimmerman, who is living in hiding, though all previous investigations showed no racial bias. Aren’t you violating Zimmerman’s civil rights?
UPDATE – Additional bonus question (from the comments): When you signed the Affordable Care Act, it included the Grassley amendment, subjecting members of Congress and their staff to the same rules as everyone else. Yet this week you signed off on special subsidies for members of Congress and their staff. Given your focus on inequality, how do you justify giving Congress Obamacare subsidies?
UPDATE 2 – Another bonus question (via Twitter): There is no longer any doubt that Nidal Hasan was motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In May, you actually acknowledged for the first time that the Ft. Hood attack was an act of “Islamic jihad.” Yet your administration still considers is “workplace violence,” which denies victims certain benefits. Isn’t it time to declare the Ft. Hood shootings a terrorist act?"

The ongoing scandal involving Internal Revenue Service targeting of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status took a step closer to the White House last week when testimony from retiring IRS tax law specialist Carter Hull before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee pointed investigators directly to the agency’s Office of Chief Counsel. 
Though Hull did not specifically name IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins as the person who ordered him to send Tea Party group applications to his office “for further review,” Hull’s testimony brought the Obama political appointee to the forefront in the ever expanding scandal.
On July 18, Hull testified that in March 2011 Judy Kindell, a senior technical advisor to Lois Lerner, then the head of the IRS tax exempt division, “told me to forward my recommendations [concerning the approval of Tea Party group applications for tax exempt status] to the Office of Chief Counsel for their review.”
Hull was asked if Ms. Kindell agreed with his earlier recommendations that the IRS had sufficient information at that time to make a determination on the Tea Party groups applications for tax-exempt status.
“She did not say whether she agreed or not. She said it should go to chief counsel,” Hull told the committee. 
On Tuesday the connection between Wilkins and the White House was strengthened when several media outlets reported that Wilkins met with the President at the White House on April 23, 2012, just two days before the IRS issued a revised set of BOLO (“Be on the lookout”) instructions to IRS agents reviewing tax-exempt applications that appear to target Tea Party groups for more stringent review standards.
Also on Tuesday, True the Vote, a Tea Party group that focuses on preventing voter fraud and was one of the groups subjected to IRS targeting, announced that it is suing Mr. Wilkins, adding him to the list of defendants in the lawsuit it filed against the IRS in May of this year.
Wilkins, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, has been a partner with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale, and Door (also known as WilmerHale), the prestigious Washington, D.C. law firm, since 1988. According to Federal Election Commission records, Mr. Wilkins has donated generously to political candidates over the years, most of them affiliated with the Democratic Party. In 2008 he represented Reverend Jeremiah Wright’s Chicago church, the one which President Obama attended for twenty years, on a pro bono basis before the IRS. President Obama named him Chief Counsel at the IRS in April, 2009.

When the trifecta of scandals first broke over the White House a few weeks ago, the media (who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the IRS and Benghazi) were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts. Over Memorial Day weekend that all changed. 
It is fairly obvious that the media used the three-day weekend to gather themselves, talk to the White House, and coordinate talking points with one another. The result of this coordination has been apparent in the words “overreach,” “McCarthyism,” “disarray,” and “no GOP agenda” — all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete, not coordinate, with one another. 
The idea is for the media to revert to form. Rather than seek the truth, the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth. Obama’s approval rating is going down, his left-wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy, and the bleeding must be stopped. 
Another piece of coordination between media and Democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places: Politico. No one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support Obama than Obama’s bullying thugs at Politico. 
During Tuesday’s testimony, Congressional Democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories. The witnesses were Tea Party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an IRS that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs. 
Democrats, however, did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted, and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the IRS scrutiny due to their political activity.  
Well, that is not the point and everyone knows it. Had the IRS put the same number of left-leaning groups through the same hyper-scrutiny as they did right-leaning groups, none of this would be happening. There would be no scandal.
But the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the IRS singled out Obama’s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run-up to Obama’s re-election campaign, to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups.  
The thinking goes that if Democrats can make the Tea Party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of Obama and further damage his opponents. 
Well, right on cue, Politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest (but expected) piece of reporting that falls right in line with what Congressional Democrats did yesterday. It is as pure a piece of coordination and left-wing propaganda as you will ever read. 
And this is the only kind of investigative reporting Politico ever does. Imagine if Politico poured these same resources into investigating the IRS’s connections to the White House or the shaping of the IRS talking points by the State Department. 
But today’s Politico piece is all about changing the subject. All it looks at is the political activity of yesterday’s Tea Party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the IRS. 
The Politico piece, however, intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal. The point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government. 
The Politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax-exempt left-leaning groups (like Obama’s Organizing for America) — groups approved by the IRS, that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and  threats of perjury-those who had their information leaked to the media. 
Working directly with the Democrats, Politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the IRS. 
The actual crime is no longer the story, according to Politico. No, the story is that the victims had it coming.

President Barack Obama talking about race? Uh oh, lots of heads exploding in conservative America.  

As you'll see below the fold, wingnutopia didn't take this very well, proving once again that the notion of ""rebranding"" for the GOP is DOA. They are the racist white American party. Not all Republicans are racist, but all racists are Republican.



As you read these, just a random sample out of 1,600 when I last looked (almost all expressing similar sentiments), remember the popular conservative claim that it's Obama who is the racist one...
He just can't keep his emotions in check or mouth shut... Obama's racist tendency is shining bright today....
Coming from a half white man... Barry, STFU.
barry's preferred target is the Constitution, and the Constitution is incapable of self-defense. At least Trayvon attacked something capable of fighting back. That puts Trayvon one step above barry in my book.
Seriously? A more ""perfect"" union? This country is getting more divided by the day thanks to BO.
All I see now are blacks running rampant looking for an excuse to loot and terrorize. GG BO for setting blacks back a couple more decades.

He isn't going to be happy until we have a full-blown race war.
What an idiot.
Congratulations Amerika. You elected this clown TWICE!

He wants a race war, and when Whitey finally fights back that's when DHS gets to use their shiny new toys.
Darn right he is divisive!
But a majority of the Black population is too.
Tell you what Mr. President, if you don't like our legal system, why not move to another country, and take your Racist supporters with you!
Whites aren't racist, they are tired of African Americans being slothful, violent, criminal, and milking the system because they squandered their free public education, and refused to learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and speak English.
Blacks are their own worst enemy!
John Derbyshire was fired when He warned Whites to stay away from Blacks.For those too stupid to follow his advice will find out what it is like to try and carry a cat home by his tail.
Aw what'sa matter, Obama? You didn't get all the mobs and deaths you wanted out of this verdict? Not enough looting and plundering and blood for you?
It was bad enough when you tacitly called on the black community to take revenge on Zimmerman by declaring that he had murdered 'your son'. Now you're saying that Zimmerman murdered YOU - and you're silently calling on all your political lovers to go out and get even on everyone else because of your 'unjust death'.
Obama - you really are a cad. I would say shame on you, but you've proven already with your greedy and wicked life that you have no shame. The sooner you are cast out of office, the better.

Repeatedly, in his own words in his own books and speeches, Obama (and most of the 96% of blacks who are Democrats) are irrational, racist, socialists who commit the majority of all crime in America in and out of government.
What do you get when a Community Organizer raised in Indonesian madrassas, tutored by Frank Marshall Davis, and mentored by Jeremiah Wright for 20 years gets reelected President?
CIVIL RACE WARS 2013

Well it’s a Fact Obama is a racist no more hiding it Barry, to
all you guilt feeling libs and to all the Hispanics that voted for him enjoy
your President you are now consider White Hispanic so you get to bend over and hold your ankles like the white folks, hope and change more like racist and violence, only in a America a violent thug is honored like a hero, but only if you’re a black thug White /
Hispanics have to answer for their crimes, Race War coming soon thanks to Obama,
and the libs are so happy but the truth is you will be the first ones taken out,
Blacks don’t really like you and hardworking Whites and Hispanics hate you also Vote Racist Vote Black.
MORE LIKELY...LIAR N' CHIEF...YOU COULD HAVE BEEN HIM...HAD NOT THE NWO BILDERBERG PICKED YOU OUT OF OBSCURITY...TO PROMOTE YOU TO THE HIGHEST POSITION IN OUR LAND...THROUGH LIES AND DECEPTIONS!
You have been bred to be where you are...you are a puppet of the NWO...working to take America down...and we know who you are...and what you are...a traitor to America...NOT a uniter of men...but a divider of men!
The descriptive names that I have given you throughout the last (5) years denote your intent and who you are.
YOU ARE...the Liar N' Chief...the Chameleon N' Chief...the FlimFlam Obamaman...the NWO Bilderberg..Obama the Bush and now just known as the 'massa' in the big house!
Yessir...we have your number and it is up in 2016!

Trayvon got what he deserved. More thugs need the get the same. Obama, you're full of $hit as a Christmas turkey.
You need to resign and go back to Indonesia and, while you're at it, take that chimpanzee of a wife with you.
IMPEACH Obama...REMOVE and IMPRISON the entire cabinet and all political appointees

I'm so sick of this jacka** inserting race and himself into every situation that involves an african American-yet he's silent, you can even hear crickets chirping, if the incident involves a Caucasian.
His very statement about the outcome and aftermath being different had it been a white male is a moot point.
Had it been a white male it would have never even been covered by the national media and that's because there are no white counterparts to the tag team duo of obama and sharpton to bring up the race issue which they are so masterfully skilled at.
Like Clint Eastwood said to Spike Lee-""HE NEEDS TO SHUT HIS FACE.""
How long did it take Obama to speak out ON BEHALF of the four American heroes killed in Benghazi? What did he do to impact their deaths? Dis he have holder change nay of our laws? Did he support any protests? Short Answer: NO!
Is this country going to survive the race and socioeconomic wars this administration seems intent upon bringing on all of us? The President has clearly drawn lines in the sand with these comments, setting us up for a black against white race war. How can we have a ""more perfect union"" when the President has done this kind of race-baiting?
Let me count the times I threw up a little in my mouth when I watched that SOB give that speech. Nothing like watching a dictator try to humble himself knowing that his little plan for Zimmerman didn't work out.
Obama should have edumacated the black masses instead of blowing smoke up their bungholios... trayvon profiled Zimmerman... assaulted him... because he thought he was gay... that is testimony from Jeantel on the witness stand and in interviews on CNN and msnbs...
No surprise the black community has to ignore the facts to justify their childish and uneducated reaction to the truth.
YOU WONDER WHY THIS SCREWBALL COMES OUT WITH THIS, TILL YOU SEE THAT CONGRESS IS LOOKING INTO THE ADMINISTRATION GETTING THE BENGHAZI SURVIVORS TO SIGN A NON DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT............
MORE SMOKE FROM THIS DICKHEAD!
In your freakin' rewritten dreams! Dumb-Ø is a white African-American brought up in privilege with white Marxist grandparents who spoiled him rotten. Where does he identify with Martin? Martin's mother may be looking to profit on her son's death but she wasn't a ho like Dumb-Ø's was.
fanning the flames!!!
giving the 'black boys' the go ahead to crack some cr@ckers!!!
better watch yourselves and your families... I know I will be!
Yesterday I was saying to myself, this weekend probably wouldn't be that bad,
now I am very concerned about the animals that will be running around trying to vindicate POtuS' statements!!!!
REALLY!?!?!? You just can't let this go can you?! You've got to stir the racial pot because your presidency has been a complete and utter FAILURE!!!!!
Obamacare and the auto bailout are imploding and we have to listen to this CRAP!
What a POS ideologue!! What an absolute embarrassment! Undeserving of the office of the presidency, posturing to representing not the country but his particular race (or at least the one he identifies with)!!
If I had a petty dictator of a president he would be Barrack Obama.

This is only a diversion so you won't think about the real problems such as the IRS and Benghazi. As long as we are bickering about Trayvon, we tend to forget about the important things
Sigh...

102,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2013/05/29/king-katzenberg-crowned-obama,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Report: Hollywood Mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg Gave $30 Million to Re-Elect Obama,"
When the subject of Hollywood and President Barack Obama comes up, most people think of the celebrities who cut videos supporting the leader’s two runs for the White House.
Others might name check movie producer Harvey Weinstein, one of Obama’s most vocal backers.
They all pale in comparison to studio mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks fame, who Mother Jones dubs the Kingmaker of the Democrat party. That hardly describes Katzenberg’s impact on two presidential elections, particularly the 2012 contest.
Katzenberg gave $3.15 million to Democratic super-PACs during the 2012 cycle–almost 30 times more than his total reported giving in 2008. (There’s no telling how much he might have given to other groups that don’t disclose their donors.) He steered millions more to Priorities–his friend and business partner, Steven Spielberg, gave $1 million, for instance. He hosted numerous fundraisers for Obama and raised more for the president than anyone else in California. All told, Katzenberg gave or raised more than $30 million to reelect Obama, helping Hollywood make up for Wall Street’s plummeting financial support of the president.
Of course, all that money means Katzenberg can get a few favors done when the need arises. And when his movie studio wanted to branch out into China, all those donations came in handy.
Obama officials say they respect Katzenberg not only for his fundraising, but also because he has no specific “ask”–no ambassadorship to Switzerland, no regulatory tweak, no nights in the Lincoln Bedroom. Even so, being Hollywood’s liaison to Washington has its perks: Obama takes Katzenberg’s calls, and he and his political adviser, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times between them during Obama’s first term. (Not all of Spahn’s visits had to do with Katzenberg.) It has also left him well positioned to advocate for his industry’s and his company’s interests in China’s booming film market.
Hollywood stars like Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis deplore the impact of unfettered cash on the political process. They even made a movie about it–The Campaign.
Will they consider a sequel targeting King Katzenberg? Don’t count on it. Money is only evil when it props up the wrong (read: right) politicians."

Not photoshopped, apparently.



Not photoshopped, apparently.

I think we're getting perilously close to the time when we can all write off Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn as a gibbering idiot.
Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn said Wednesday that President Obama was getting “getting perilously close” to the Constitutional standard for impeachment. Coburn was speaking at the Muskogee, Oklahoma Civic Center.
If you think Coburn is going to provide any coherent argument to support that statement whatsoever, you are going to be sorely disappointed.
“What you have to do is you have to establish the criteria that would qualify for proceedings against the president and that’s called impeachment” Coburn said, responding to a question about holding President Obama accountable. “That’s not something you take lightly and you have to use a historical precedent of what that means. I think there’s some intended violation of the law in this administration, but I also think there’s a ton of incompetence of people who are making decisions.”
Well yes, yes you do. To the apparent irritation of the entire Republican caucus, you are still nominally supposed to establish some criteria that might justify impeaching the president before you start contemplating whether or not to impeach the president. Something. Anything. While apparently we are in a time when some Republican congressmen summon legal teams in order to assign them the task of coming up with some plausible reason to impeach the president, I think you are generally supposed to have some particular outrage in mind before you get, er, outraged about it.
More on Sen. Coburn below the fold.


That was the original theory, anyway. In practice you can also go the Ken Starr route; that had been discredited for a while due to that whole being-a-stain-on-the-nation-and-an-embarassment-to-all-concerned bit, but enough of it seems to have finally been forcibly clubbed down the memory hole, now, and the newcomers seem to have a fondness for the thing.
This isn't some Rep. NoName Bumblefuck, though, this is Sen. Tom Coburn, who we all recognize as a very important person because other important people will not stop rattling on about it, and also because Tom Coburn has considerably more than his fair share when it comes to making sure world's greatest deliberative body cannot so much as sneeze without three hearings, two secret holds and five sniffling letters to other government officials about how this or that is the greatest outrage everz, probably, maybe, if you squint just right and look at it sideways. All right, Mr. Coburn, knock us out. Tell us what the intended violation of the law might be. Tell us what level of ""incompetence"" compares to the military fiascos, anti-terrorism ball-dropping and economic catastrophe visited upon us by the last president, the one who will not be named.
No? Nothing much? Throw us a bone here, give us something to work with. Surely you didn't plan on piping up on how very close to impeachable the president's actions have been only to shrug your shoulders and say that you can't be bothered to think about it too hard or to explain why.
“My little wiggle out of that when I get that written to me is I believe that needs to be evaluated and determined but thank goodness it doesn’t have to happen in the Senate until they’ve brought charges in the House. Those are serious things but we’re in a serious time. I don’t have the legal background to know if that rises to high crimes and misdemeanor but I think they’re getting perilously close.”
Oh, you poor dumb jackass. Yes, thank goodness you don't have to worry your gargantuan head over whether or not any of what you are saying is utter bullshit, since other people will have to come up with the precise wording of the bullshit first. Thank goodness we can all just agree among our Republican selves that, shit, son, there's got to be something in there worth impeaching a sitting president for, but we don't really have to worry about it until Darrell Issa finally comes up with a crayon drawing that the rest of us can put on the Senate fridge with a straight face.
And for the record, I see absolutely nothing to indicate that we are in a serious time. All evidence suggests we are in a decidedly un-serious time. We bleat on about fake scandals, not even having the decency anymore to drop them after they have been roundly disproven. We have a Congress that ties itself in knots even over its most basic, primitive tasks, primarily because it is too preoccupied with drawing up various Obamacair is bad dumhead scribbles and launching them, giggling, over to the other branches of government. There are a very large number of very serious things happening in the world, to be sure, but to say we are in serious times implies that we might be doing jack-all about any of them, and that is the singular most prominent thing we are not doing. No matter what economic or legislative building might be on fire, we still get the same clown-driven firetruck circus act; lots of selzer, a few painful looking gimmicks with the ladder, and bucket after bucket of confetti hurled hither and tither and yon. If you are going to mutter about serious times, you need to at least take the brightly colored rubber nose off. If you are going to furrow your brow and look troubled about serious times, you ought to at least stop squeezing your rubber nose and yelling ""Honk honk, impeachment!"" at the audience.
Or not, whatever.
“Barack Obama is personal friend of mine. He became my friend in the Senate but that does not mean I agree in anyway with what he’s doing or how he’s doing it. And I quite frankly think he’s in a difficult position he’s put himself in and if it continues, I think we’re going to have another constitutional crisis in our country in terms of the presidency,” Coburn concluded.
If he continues what, precisely? Be specific. Hell, be unspecific. Is it the pursuing policies that the Republican Party does not like, is that the impeachable thing? Is it the wanting to put judges on benches, even if the other party has decided that they no longer want any judges, thank you? Is it Benghazi? Please tell me it is Benghazi. Please tell me that you are contemplating impeaching a president for allowing a terrorist attack on a foreign-based embassy, because by God, I have a list of people who need to have their names scrubbed from various buildings and freeways and aircraft carriers post haste, if that is the standard now. It can't be the IRS ""scandal,"" because even I give Tom Coburn more credit than that, and I am generally someone who suspects Tom Coburn would get his head stuck in a mailbox if he didn't have two staff members at all times keeping him from doing it. Crap, man, just write ACORN on your forehead and go with that, don't make your constituents strain their noggins on these things.
We might just write this up to pandering. Perhaps Sen. Tom Coburn is not, in fact, as addled as he comes across, and knows full well he doesn't have a shred of anything he can point to as the unforgivable crime of the current presidency, but he is just humoring a group of clearly touched-in-the-head constituents in order to make them feel good about themselves. That is, though, just as bad. We are in the position we are in precisely because Mr. Coburn's party has yet to find a constituent yet whose ideas are so ridiculous or so offensive that some thrice-elected boil will not eagerly agree with them. The president is not really an American? Run with it! The president is secretly Muslim, is secretly against America, is secretly possibly in league with Muslim terrorists? Hell, anything's possible! The president is ""packing the courts"" by nominating judges to open positions on courts? The fiend. The president used his partisan mind-waves to task the IRS with track down conservative and liberal political groups illegally masquerading as nonpartisan outlets and slightly annoy them? That is the most Nixonian thing ever, and not at all the ravings of the single most boring and least creative insane person ever born anywhere, at any time.
We have now reached the point where even conservative senators muttering about impeachment has become old hat. The level of ridiculousness has gotten so high that by God, it's actually gotten boring. It's to the point where you can look at any given video of any given speech by any given leader of the Republican tribe and just presume that it is going to be nothing more than a stream of drivel about one or 20 different conspiracy theories, a tired propping up of death panels or birth certificates or ammo hoarding or some new level of tyranny from the Bush administration that was only discovered to be tyranny now. What happens now? What happens when the clowns have been performing so long that nobody else thinks they're funny, or even interesting? Do the clowns just keep on going, keep on putting on that same show? Is there a bigger, better rubber nose in development, something that will really wow the crowds this time and save the whole bit?

Sen. Chuck Schumer: ""Leave Wall Street aloooone!""



Sen. Chuck Schumer: ""Leave Wall Street aloooone!""

Chuck Schumer, 2009, in his book Positively American:
We had the majority! It seemed somehow appropriate that as a new majority dawned for Senate Democrats, two candidates who had been propelled by the growing ""net roots"" (Democratic-leaning bloggers), had made the difference in the end.
Chuck Schumer, now:
IC: You don’t think Elizabeth Warren makes a villain out of Wall Street?
CS: I am just going to leave it at what I said.
IC: Forget Warren then. Is this a problem for your party?
CS: You don’t want to go after them for the sake of going after them. The left-wing blogs want you to be completely and always anti–Wall Street. It’s not the right way to be.
IC: So are the left-wing blogs as bad as the Tea Party ones in this case?
CS: Left-wing blogs are the mirror image. They just have less credibility and less clout.

Left-wing blogs had credibility when they were helping Schumer's DSCC win control of the Senate. Now that we're criticizing Wall Street? No credibility! And we're just like the Tea Party, having cost Democrats a half-dozen seats and the Senate majority in the last couple of years.
Oh, you mean we haven't pushed the Democratic Party outside of the national mainstream?Weird, then. On the other hand, it wasn't bloggers trying to save Sen. Scott Brown's hide in 2012, like good ol' Chuck:
There is a good little story. [Looks to aide] I can tell this. I went to Scott Brown and said, “If you give us the sixtieth vote for the Citizens United rollback, we won’t go after you.”  
If it was up to Schumer, he would've traded an entire Senate seat for one meaningless cloture vote on a bill that would've died a quick death in the House. God knows his Wall Street benefactors would've been thrilled at that!
From my perspective, intra-party relations have never been better. It seems odd that Schumer is trying to start an internecine war at this very moment, particularly with a tough 2014 up ahead. And as the number three Democrat in the Senate, his words carry outsized weight. But it's clear that the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party is feeling the heat from its resurgent populist wing: the Warrens, Baldwins, Browns and Merkleys.
Republicans are locked in their own bloody civil war. Schumer (and his Third Way allies) may have just signaled that we may be in for some bloodshed of our own. In fact, he appears eager to lead Wall Street's counter attack.

I’d like to congratulate the voters of Australia for doing what the voters of America should have done in 2012:
Australia’s conservative leader Tony Abbott swept into office in national elections on Saturday as voters punished the outgoing Labor government for six years of turbulent rule and for failing to maximize the benefits of a now fading mining boom.
Abbott, a former boxer, Rhodes scholar and trainee priest, promised to restore political stability, cut taxes and crack down on asylum seekers arriving by boat.
“From today I declare that Australia is under new management and Australia is once more open for business,” Abbott told jubilant supporters in Sydney.
America, on the other hand, will not be open for business until 2017 at the earliest.
It’s always a mistake to overstate the similarities between different national political environments – the differences are profound in even the most similar countries.  But there are some sharp parallels to be drawn here, particularly on the need for pro-growth tax cuts, and the squandering of a natural resources revolution.  Obama’s War On Energy has some similarities to the way Australians seem to feel their mining boom was wasted:
The election was been pitched as a choice on who is best to lead the A$1.5 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy as it adjusts to an end to a prolonged mining investment boom, fuelled by China’s demand for its abundant natural resources.
Abbott, 55, built up a strong opinion poll lead on the back of promises to rein in government spending, scrap an unpopular tax on carbon emissions, and stop the flow of refugee boats arriving in Australia’s northwest.
His campaign had support from media magnate Rupert Murdoch and his Australian newspapers, which have urged voters to reject Rudd’s Labor government. Australia’s other major newspaper group Fairfax also called for a change of government, saying
Rudd had painted Abbott’s planned spending cuts as dangerous European-style austerity and said his government was best placed to manage an economy that is slowing but remains the envy of much of the developed world.
This is really a golden moment for any aspiring capitalist economy to eat America’s lunch.  We’re years away from being remotely competitive.  The Obama Democrats are hell-bent to double down on his failed policies, not just due to ideological rigidity, but because Obama’s ego will never allow him to admit he’s been fundamentally wrong about everything for five years.  
And the American ruling class has become quite obsessed with using socialist policies to build invulnerable voting coalitions of government dependents.  They take Obama’s re-election as a sign that the American electorate is reasonably comfortable with the New Normal of double-digit real unemployment, expensive gas, a declining standard of living, out-of-control government spending, and all the rest of it.  The bar of economic leadership was lowered to accommodate President Obama; the ruling class doesn’t think it will be raised any time soon.
Now is your moment, aspiring capitalist tigers of the world.  The American workforce is buried under food stamps and long-term disability checks; employers are wrapped in chains of regulation, held tightly shut with the padlocks of ObamaCare.  No corporation in its right mind would relocate into the American quagmire of soaring corporate taxes (with class-warfare battle cries signaling even worse to come), high labor costs, and crushing regulatory burdens.  Every CEO in the world watched Democrats march Apple Inc. executives into a show trial and berate them for daring to keep their offshore revenue offshore, instead of bringing it home so Uncle Sam could cut himself a thick slice.  They all watched Obama and his party present irresponsible government deficits as an argument for tax increases, rather than government reform.  
A weakened America has turned away from its bedrock principles of economic liberty.  A huge void is waiting to be filled.

Inadvertently or not, John Boehner showed the way out of the shutdown on a Sunday talk show yesterday.
Listen to what he said on This Week with George Stephanopoulos:
STEPHANOPOULOS: He has not, perhaps, but I take it from your answer that you're not prepared to schedule a clean bill on government funding.
BOEHNER: There are not the votes in the House to pass a clean CR.

The 2 Word challenge that all Democrats must issue
 immediately :                          
PROVE IT
 



John Boehner has now made his own credibility an issue in the shutdown.
Americans want the government to re-open. Speaker Boehner is telling us that is not possible at this time and that our government must remain shuttered because the votes simply aren't there for a clean CR to pass.
I personally hate to believe that the Speaker of the House of Representatives is an actual liar and yet, I have to believe that he is. I understand that the votes are there.
Here's a Tally Of Which Republicans Are Ready To Fund the Government With No Strings Attached
The only way to resolve this issue - Is the Speaker of the House of Representatives Being Truthful to the American Public is for him to PROVE IT.
Offer up the clean CR with the same budget numbers you agreed to last month then count the votes.
The Speaker indicated that it's a waste of time. We do know that the Republicans don't really mind wasting time since they have pointlessly repealed the ACA 42 times, so that wouldn't be the real reason for not presenting it.
In fact, the only reason I can come up with for not presenting the clean CR is the obvious one:
Because it will pass and expose the Speaker of the House as the weak, unreliable, prevaricating  politician that he has been throughout these negotiations.
If Mr. Boehner does not want the American public to think these are the underlying reasons for not presenting the CR, he should act swiftly to counter this impression.
So Speaker Boehner, you say the votes aren't there -I ask again for you to
PROVE IT

The house that dumb built.



The house that dumb built.

I'm not sure that there's much nuance to be parsed out about the sequester and why we seem to be headed for it despite it being plainly and obviously the worst possible thing to do. The problem is that the one actually sensible solution—to just dump the whole idea, as Congress can do at any point during this entire ridiculous, posturing debacle—isn't politically palatable to any of the involved groups. Sure, the sequester will foul up the economy, hurt a hell of a lot of people and botch up important government functions all around the nation, but as of right now both parties see ""screw up the entire American economy, again"" as being preferable to any of the achievable political alternatives.
The Republicans know the partial shutdown of services is going to hurt—a lot. They also know they're going to be blamed for it, no matter what little Twitter hashtags they deploy to the contrary, and that once people with government jobs or government contracts actually start getting furloughed, costing them a hefty chunk of their paychecks, people are quickly going to become irate. Every small town in America is going to be awash with the news of what's been cut, and how many local residents are being furloughed, and how that's going to affect the rest of the local economy, and they'll all be duly noting that there was abso-effing-lutely no reason for it other than this stupid ""cut everything because governmenting is hard and stuff"" plan.
The problem for Republicans, however, is that they've premised nearly all of their obsessive anti-Obama rhetoric around the notions that (1) the government can't create jobs, (2) all government is bad, and (3) the scary deficit monster is going to kill us all. They can't stomach voting to lift the sequester when that means acknowledging (1) that government does indeed employ lots of people, (2) it does indeed do stuff that their constituents like, and need, and (3) the deficit is in fact not currently as important as the more immediate task of not screwing up the tenuous national economy, because Basic Economics. You can hear them already in the early stages of talking-point disarray on the topic, but Republicans are supposed to be for harsh, painful cuts to government. That's their brand. (True, they want different cuts, but the different cuts are just as deep and egregious, they were just supposed to be in things that Republicans, well, hated more. When you're cutting this deep during this economy, though, you're going to hit bone no matter where you put the knife.)
So for Republicans, the only way to dodge the sequester is to fess up that their entire debt ceiling freakout, and all of their demands afterwards, and all of the loudest premises of their electoral existence in these last few campaigns were all mere bluff. The only escape hatch that the White House is providing is the original plan that would mitigate the nastiness of the cuts by coming up with new revenues, i.e. new taxes; again, this requires Republicans not just going against campaign promises, but abandoning their entire supposed economic philosophy on the subject, period. Forget ideological integrity in these things: You have to acknowledge that even if the Republicans wanted to ditch every austerian, anti-legitimacy-of-government, anti-revenue principle they've been working themselves into a froth over during these last years, they're at least going to need a little more time to come up with a creative explanation for it. A new Twitter hashtag isn't going to cover that one.
The Republicans have invested themselves so heavily in these two brands of economic extremism that they are now ingrained into everything the Republican Party stands for. Whether those previous assertions mesh with plain reality or with the political needs of the moment (or, God help them, a phalanx of furious donors and lobbyists whose industries are about to be hit with that same axe) is irrelevant now. They're screwed. The sequester represents government as they advocated for it to be run: sharp, painful cuts done with an axe instead of a scalpel. They stood up and demanded it outright, during the debt ceiling fight. Then they all signed onto a law to do just that. If they're complaining, it's only because they only now realized that their demanded fantasy plan is about to be put into action, and that the results might not be the glowing American utopia that they've been promising. Follow me below the fold for more of the stupid.


The White House, on the other hand, is heavily invested in Grand Bargainism. They seem equally averse to suggesting the obvious plan, proposing Congress simply nix the ridiculously premised sequester and move on to smaller, more focused budget efforts like sensible people. In part that may be because they know the first side to suggest substantively weakening the sequester will then be the ""pro-deficit"" and ""big government"" side in the other party's pissy talking points for the next decade; in larger part, it seems to be because the administration itself is (yet again) so enamored with striking a Big Budget Deal that they are (yet again) pushing for the Big Budget Deal even when it's not necessary or wise. This was the same dynamic that led the White House into previous catastrophic ""negotiations"" with Congress as to whether or not the nation would shut down or default on its debts, negotiations which legitimized those same Republican threats in a rather stumbling attempt by the White House to reach some supposed ""larger"" agreement that would, in their minds, neutralize further budget fights for a while. The entire premise that any sufficiently ""large"" agreement would result in the other side not asking for more afterwards seems to be the height of political gullibility; nonetheless, that's what happened, and that's what kept happening in subsequent, related posturing, and all indications suggest that we're about to repeat the exact same thing.
So to the White House, accepting a bevy of damaging austerity-premised cuts is still considered a good bargain, if they can either (1) pry out tax concessions from the Republicans, which is at this point a goal unto itself, or (2) if the end result is ""big"" enough that the White House feels they won't have to do this crap again for a year or two. Not inspiring stuff, but again: There's no particular incentive on their parts to avoid the sequester outright. Sure, it'll hurt the economy, but Republicans will be blamed, a deal will be struck sooner or later or even later than that, then boom, victory.
As for House and Senate Democrats? They don't seem to even enter into things. They hold veto power over whatever the administration and Republicans decide to do, but as advocates for any other outcome, they're nonexistent. Again, because ""how about we not screw up the entire economy as political prank"" is right out, from a party messaging standpoint, leaving us only to debate how badly we'll be screwing it up and who will get what portion of the blame afterwards.
It's the precise dynamic of the debt ceiling fight, except this time, if possible, it's even worse because both sides have now fully embraced the rather strange notion that the economy isn't as important as enforcing a little austerity right now and damn the consequences. The fight is between the far right and the Simpson-Bowles right: all good, reasonable villagers agree that we need to screw retirees and others on the economic fringes, we're just haggling over who and how much. (Centrist ""victory"" in these matters will consist of getting Republicans to raise tax revenue after Republicans spent an entire eight-year administration lowering that same tax revenue to plainly unsustainable levels, which sounds like just asking those Republicans to exercise some common sense, and in fact is exactly that so good luck with it.)

So that's why we're at where we're at. The Republicans can't blink without looking like they're backing down on every one of their most cherished and loudly shouted supposed fiscal principles, principles that made their appearance in the debt ceiling fight and which caused this whole wreck of a thing in the first place. That's assuming, mind you, they have enough party unity left to even make a decision either way, which itself is far from a given. The White House thinks that no matter how bad things may be at this point or may get, they've at least finally got a good hand, and that they'll be able to bring Republicans back to the bargaining table after the very real bite of the sequester starts making for some very, very angry constituents back in Republican hometowns, thus finally leading the two sides to a lovely bipartisan agreement on some unknown (and, in all probability, disproportionately small) new amount of new tax revenues.
Sequester, here we come.
There's always the possibility that either side will blink. Even though the sequester is allegedly a Republican dream (Cutting the entire discretionary federal budget by an arbitrary percentage for no good reason? Be still my Norquistian heart!), the Republicans are unambiguously in the weaker position for the simple reasons that (1) the sequester is economically untenable for any period longer than a few days or weeks, and (2) the public is going to blame the jackasses who have been loudly cheering for government cuts when those cuts happen and start to hurt, because duh. Nonetheless, Republicans can't not shoot that hostage, because they said they would.
The White House might also cave for considerably less than their purported targets. Good money might even bet on that outcome, in fact, given the past (cough) history involved. And while I'm not a fan of the White House premise of using this same hostage to again attempt ""grand bargain"" revenue concessions, given that their role in avoiding the sequester is at this point merely advisory, there's not particularly any other path for them to take. True, they could beg House Republicans to simply call the whole thing off, but that argument is an obvious non-starter, so it won't happen. In any event, Grand Bargaining is in the air, God help us all.
So that's that. A very, very large number of Americans are about to be hurt for no particular reason other the Republican (and Officially Serious Villager, we must not forget) demand that we cut government and the deficit right the hell now, full stop, end of discussion. A very large number of Americans will be losing pay, they'll be losing needed services—they'll be losing things as basic as local airports that stay open. The desired outcome of this plan for both parties is to then establish a set of smaller or different cuts, possibly including the dramatic inclusion of slightly more tax revenue, and the prime long-term question is whether this entire process will merely stall the current, tenuous economic recovery or will, in some areas, kill it outright.
Make sense? Of course it doesn't. As an ideological belief, the current sudden-onset deficit fetishism was never meant to make sense in the first place. As with most things stubbornly ideological, however, merely knowing before the fact that it is a horrible, stupid, and clearly damaging idea is insufficient reason to not do it.

It's not every day that GOP defends itself by claiming to be two-faced



It's not every day that GOP defends itself by claiming to be two-faced

So far in 2013, House Speaker John Boehner has relied on Democratic votes to overcome overwhelming Republican opposition on back-to-back pieces of legislation: the Hurricane Sandy relief aid package on Tuesday night and the tax cliff deal from two weeks earlier. But if you think this proves that most Republicans have marginalized themselves and that Democrats are now an essential part of making the House function, House Majority Deputy Whip Tom Cole of Oklahoma says you're wrong. Why? Because, he says, secretly about half of Republicans who voted no actually wanted the legislation to pass:
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, part of the Republican whip team responsible for marshaling support for legislation, said the current makeup of House Republicans could be divided roughly into a third who voted in favor of the bill because they wanted it to pass, a third who voted against the bill because they wanted it to fail, and a third who voted against the bill but had their fingers crossed that it would pass and avert a fiscal and political calamity.
One lawmaker, Mr. Cole said, told him that while he did not want to vote in favor of the bill, he also did not want to amend it and send it back to the Senate where it might die and leave House Republicans blamed for tax increases. “So I said, ‘What you’re really telling me is that you want it to pass, but you don’t want to vote for it,'” recalled Mr. Cole, who voted yes.

And why would a Republican vote no while secretly hoping for yes?
Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and once the top spokesman for the former House speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican, described the phenomenon thusly: “These are people who are political realists, they’re political pragmatists who want to see progress made in Washington, but are politically constrained from making compromises because they will be challenged in the primary.”
In other words, about half of Republicans who vote with the hardline reactionary fringe aren't actually devoted wingnut true believers—they are actually just cowards, afraid of standing up to their political base. Whatever you think of the ethics of that, it's an invaluable insight for Democrats to remember as we move forward on issues like the debt limit. Take, for example, what the aforementioned Tom Cole said yesterday about the debt limit:
Congressman Cole is adamant that he will not accede to President Obama's unequivocal demand to raise it without any spending cuts tied to it.
“I couldn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that,"" Cole told me in a phone interview.
""We didn’t downgrade our credit [in 2011] because of the debt ceiling fight. We downgraded in my view because when we had the fight we didn’t cut enough,"" Cole said. ""Just raising the debt ceiling with no compromise sends the wrong message—that we think we can willy-nilly go on forever.""
""If there are not serious cuts, the Republican votes are not going to be there,"" Cole continued.

Tough talk, except this is the guy who just said half of Republicans who voted no on the tax cliff deal actually supported it. And given that Cole voted for the tax cliff deal and the  Hurricane Sandy package, it's not a shock that he might vote no on a clean debt deal, passing the responsibility to another one of his colleagues. But when you listen to a third interview with Cole, also from yesterday, it seems clear that he knows Republicans need to let the debt limit go up, no matter how he votes.
Even as Republican officials maintain the GOP majority is safe, several lawmakers and longtime activists warn of far-reaching political ramifications if voters perceive Republicans as botching consequential talks on the debt ceiling, sequestration and a possible government shutdown.
“Majorities are elected to do things, and if they become dysfunctional, the American people will change what the majority is,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a House deputy majority whip and a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, told The Hill.

So basically we're looking at a House Republican Conference in which members want to (a) develop a voting record that protects them from primary challenges while (b) not actually having that voting record influence the final outcome, because if it does, then they worry they will lose the majority in the general election. And if that's not a golden opportunity for Democrats to put House Republicans on defense throughout the 113th Congress, then nothing is.

The evidence could not be stronger. Over 30 years have passed since Reagan laid out the Republican economic agenda. It was simple and people wanted to believe. Keep government out of peoples lives and let them keep what they earn. Government is the problem. Make things easy for business to flourish by loosening regulations and lowering their taxes because if business can flourish all will benefit as their profits will ""trickle down"" to bring prosperity to all.

Fast forward to the present; after more than 30 years of Republican political dominance, the results of Republican/conservative policies are all too apparent. The free market supply side forces have been responsible for creating the greatest income disparity since the gilded age. The United States has lost ground internationally in most demonstrable criteria including: median income, access to health care, infant mortality and economic dominance. And the Republican era of power culminated in an economic free fall which cost the American economy $12.8 trillion dollars and 8 million jobs. The failure of the republican/conservative economic agenda is stunning in its totality.
But there is nowhere the Republican failure is more devastating than in the global response to climate change.
Continue below the fold to read more about the cost of this conservative obstruction.


At the end of World War II the United States emerged as the world leader economically and politically. The advantages and responsibilities of world leadership was in our hands. We built on the New Deal to strengthen the middle class with Social Security and Medicare and then focused on human rights with the Civil Rights Act. Then in 1981 came the Reagan revolution. And in a symbolic act President Reagan took down the solar panels which had been installed on the Carter White House. This act symbolized that new guys were in town and it also meant that government was being pushed out of the way for business to take its place as the rightful representative of the American people.
That was about the same time that understanding about our species' contribution to climate warming was being discussed in the global scientific community. It was already recognized that our industrial consumption based on fossil fuels was the leading cause of our atmospheric pollution. It was also recognized that global warming would require a global response, with nations working together to advance and implement solutions. Our global economic and political leadership placed us in a position of responsibility to the global challenge of climate change; but here is where we abdicated our global leadership responsibility and the Republican ideology of laissez faire collided with the needed response to our changing climate.

In the over 30 years of Republican political dominance, the evidence of anthropogenic climate change has only strengthened to the point that 97 percent of credible climate scientists support the overwhelming evidence of human caused climate change. Yet over that time the Republican/conservative response has been to use its power to misinform and to obstruct any progress to mitigate. The Republican political leaders have taken the side of their business buddies—the fossil fuel industry, who have rewarded them with obnoxious sums of money for their support which has assured them of unrivaled control of the energy market. In the 112th GOP-controlled congress alone there have been 317 votes taken against the environment.
The cost of this obstruction and misinformation? It increasingly looks like the cost the world will be paying for this idiotic political malfeasance is a safe future for our children and grandchildren. We have lost too much time in implementing solutions and already many in the world especially the most vulnerable are on the road to mass suffering and hunger.
Republicans: The blood is on your hands.

Moment of realization

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, you are a dumbass. Sorry, but there's really no other professional political way to put it. It looks once again like a group of austerity-obsessed Republicans have suddenly discovered a pressing new need for some of those parts of government they decided they didn't want to pay for. Specifically, the part they suddenly discover personally affects them:
With Tropical Storm Chantal headed for South Florida with landfall likely Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott is sounding alarm bells about the impact of National Guard furloughs on state storm preparations. “The problem is you’re losing training time, you’re losing preparation time,” Scott said during a radio interview in Jacksonville. “When will the National Guard make the decision that we stop the furloughs? Right after the hurricane hits?”
Mr. Scott, I have it on very good authority that the National Guard has been implementing furloughs because Republicans insisted they not be paid enough to avoid furloughs. It was called sequestration and it was in all the papers. You may have heard of it.
Scott joined with two other Southern Republican governors whose states are in the path of tropical storms to write a letter to President Obama urging him to call off the furloughs. In Florida, nearly 1,000 employees of the National Guard are furloughed once a week, saving the federal government money under the congressionally mandated sequester but costing the state in readiness.
One of those two other Southern Republican governors is of course Bobby Jindal, most famous for being pissed off at something called ""volcano monitoring"" because his state doesn't have volcanos, but a firm believer in ""hurricane monitoring"" because Bobby Jindal only believes in things he can see out his window. It isn't so much an ideological conviction for him as it is pure self-centeredness, self-centeredness above and beyond that of the usual Republican wag.
So that's great, you're sending a letter off to President Obama saying you're very very peeved about the congressionally mandated requirement that members of the National Guard be furloughed because Republicans have insisted not just on implementing what all parties agreed at the beginning was the Stupidest Possible Way to cut spending, but are now insisting that we not actually fix because Congress is literally simply too incompetent to pass any better idea. You know who would be a better person to complain to than President Obama? The damn Republicans who insist on the furloughs. The people who put the ""mandate"" in the ""congressional mandate"" part. You even have their numbers, it wouldn't be a hard call.
Unless, of course, this isn't actually about avoiding potentially dangerous cuts to government safety programs, but about moving money around (the executive branch can't do a whole lot of that either, by the way) so as to screw somebody else in order to reverse only the cuts to government safety that affect you, and your state, and the people who will have your head on a plastic cafeteria tray if you screw things up. Because that wouldn't just be stupid, that'd make you kind of a bastard.
My lingering suspicion has long been that the House, crippled by their own ideological schisms, incompetence and eff-it-all approach to government, will never be able to actually pass any legislation that removes the need for government-wide furloughs, program cancellations, and other drastic measures. They'll just go through the entire roster of government duties one-by-one, refunding each and every thing a week after the cut to that thing resulted in either a minor fiasco or an outright disaster, and only when the fiascos or outright disasters are things they can personally see out their office windows. That seems to be the case—though if we count recent House Republican reactions to natural disasters not in their own states but merely in other Republican-led states, even that might might be expecting too much of them.

Not for days, not for weeks, but for months, Joe Scarborough and his Morning Joe panel not only pushed, begged and berated Congress to pass new gun control laws — they threatened, shamed, mocked, and laughed in the faces of anyone who dared disagree. But Tuesday, voters in the bluer-than-red state-of Colorado told Scarborough and company to go get their shine box.  Here is their unforgettably awkward and red-faced reaction:
—

—
What we saw from Scarborough and company, in the months following the terrible murders at Sandy Hook Elementary, wasn’t even concern-trolling; it was The Sanctimony of Our Betters coming from those who had deluded themselves into believing the GOP and NRA were on the path to irrelevance unless they reversed course and restricted Americans’ Second Amendment civil rights with laws that would have done absolutely nothing to stop another Sandy Hook. 
To listen to Scarborough, it was NRA that was losing its political clout. To listen to Scarborough, it was the GOP ensuring they would lose seats. “Oh, no,” Joe screamed! “The ‘lying‘ GOP is doomed if they don’t listen to me and hand Obama a victory on guns!”
Even after Manchin-Toomey died in the Senate, Scarborough and his peanut-gallery practiced a scorched-earth policy to hammer the NRA and GOP as out-of-touch, suicidal nitwits for not caving to their relentless emotional blackmail and cherry-picked polls. 
Well, a funny thing happened on the way to Reality, a funny thing called democracy — something that would not have caught The Bubbled off-guard had they been adult enough to consider this poll, or perhaps this one. Tuesday in Colorado, although outspent by the opposition, everyday citizens, with some help from the NRA, booted out two Democrat State Senators for passing the same gun control laws Scarborough demanded the GOP pass in order to survive. 
In other words, Scarborough was 100% wrong — it is Democrats and Bloomberg’s anti-gun group that took a beating for taking Scarborough’s advice. 
So watch the video again… This what a boorish, unrelenting, shrill, dishonest, and holier-than-thou crusade looks like after it meets American Liberty.

Dana Bash of CNN reported Wednesday evening that all of the Democratic Senators facing re-election in 2014 would back a “new” proposal to delay the Obamacare enrollment deadline–not really “new,” since Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) already said he would propose legislation to delay the individual mandate, and House Republicans passed a bill in late September to avoid a government shutdown if the mandate were delayed.
new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline
— Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 23, 2013
The House proposal failed in the Senate, 54-46, on a party-line vote. Every single Democrat voted against the proposed delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, including those up for re-election in 2014, including red-state Democrats–all of them. If just five of them had shifted, the shutdown would have been avoided and the delay would have been passed–to face Obama’s veto, but the point would have been made.
Furthermore, there are sixteen Democrats facing re-election in the Senate, almost enough to override the president’s veto. If just a few more Democrats–perhaps the five planning to retire–had switched to back a delay that even the White House is said to be considering in one form or another, then Obama’s veto would not have been a threat. The disastrous Obamacare rollout, and the shutdown, would not have happened.
As I wrote on Sep. 23, that solution was “Win-win. Therefore unlikely.” But it should have happened, if the media had been more interested in the substance of the issue rather than whether Obama would win or lose. Instead, they helped Democrats and the media label the GOP as terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, “Gremlins” (my favorite) and suicide bombers–while some Republicans joined in the insults.
When the polls landed, Democrats became the “terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, and suicide bombers,” pressing their perceived advantage to demand the reversal of the budget sequester–at least until their allies in the media quietly warned them not to squander their victory. Now that some Democrats have embraced what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and–yes–John Boehner fought for, no one is calling them nasty names.
What’s done is done–and Republicans will have to find a way back from what was, in the end, a very real political loss. But let it be noted, along the way, that the very same Democrats who will now be lining up to support a delay in the enrollment deadline or individual mandate were proud that they “never folded” in the debate just a few weeks ago. They had their chance to protect Americans. They protected Obama instead."

That CNN poll that demonstrates that yes, Republicans really did shoot themselves in the foot with their government shutdown and debt ceiling brinksmanship, also demonstrated, again, that Obamcare isn't so unpopular these days.
Even though they lost this round, conservatives vow to continue their fight to dismantle Obamacare. And they point to major troubles with the rollout of the website where Americans without insurance can enroll in the new health care exchanges. [...]
According to the poll, just more than four in 10 say they favor the law, with 56% opposed to it.
But of those opposed, 38% say they are against the law because they think it's too liberal and 12% say it's not liberal enough. That means that 53% either support Obamacare, or say it's not liberal enough.

Huh, about the same percentage (54 percent) that say ""it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House."" Seriously, Republicans, we're done with this fight. The majority wasn't with you on repeal: In March, 2011, in May, 2011 (and that's a Rasmussen poll!), in July, 2012, in November, 2012 (as if the election weren't indication enough), and finally July of this year.
Seriously, enough.

It's back, now with even more pain.



It's back, now with even more pain.

Rep. Paul Ryan has once again resurrected his hugely unpopular Medicare voucher plan (they're calling it ""competitive bidding""), now with even more stuff to make it unpopular. Bowing to the reality that his numbers just don't add up to what he says will be a balanced budget in 10 years, Ryan has decided to break the promise Republicans made to protect people 55 and older from his cuts.
That's the promise he and Mitt Romney made on the 2012 campaign trail and the promise GOP Congress members ran on, and now some of them are ""furious"" with Ryan's reversal.
After agreeing to write a budget resolution that will balance the budget over the next decade, Ryan conceded that he might have to adjust the age to as high as 59.
The dwindling group of middle-of-the-road House Republican lawmakers decried the potential change in age because the party for the past two years has repeatedly cited 55 years and above as the untouched generation. Some of the members are also facing challenging reelection races next year.
“A lot of people had made commitments at 55. In other words, in the campaign [Republican vulnerable members] said it wouldn’t affect your Medicare for retirees or near retirees for those 55 and up ... and [if] this budget forces them to renege on that, that would be problematic for many,” said the GOP lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The handful of ""moderate"" Republicans (the ones who have to appear not quite as crazy as they really are because they're in tougher districts) aren't likely to be a big enough force in the party to convince Ryan to change his mind. He's got to make a stab at getting his numbers to finally work, and the only way he can do that, and get in all the tax cuts he wants, is by starving a few more grannies.
All of which could make 2014 just a little more profitable for Democrats, particularly if they can stave off any grand bargain that includes Medicare.

This, in Kentucky, sent shivers up the GOP's spine:
[35-year-old Ronald Hudson had] never had insurance before and said his hospital bills were up to $23,000 at this point.
“Good night,” Lively said, tapping in his information.
Kids: five. Salary: about $14,000 before taxes.
“You’re going to qualify for a medical card,” she told Hudson.
“Well, thank God,” Hudson said, laughing. “I believe I’m going to be a Democrat.”

This interview took place in Breathitt County, solid Red territory:

Odds are that Hudson, a male, was a Republican. Those odds increase given he lives in Breathitt County. The fact that he is white almost guarantees it (in 2008, just 34 percent of white Kentucky males voted for Obama, and Obama lost ground in the state in 2012). And his sentence formulation, ""I'm going to be"" clinches it.
Thus, we have the perfect illustration of why Republicans have fought Obamacare every step of the way, and are still working to sabotage it: A rural southern white male is openly talking about becoming a Democrat. Why? Because Democrats have now made his life a little better.
Republicans could've shared in the credit by working with Democrats to pass what was their Heritage-designed plan. Instead, they've staked their entire existence on its defeat. Thus, Hudson will have a stark choice in 2014: Vote for Mitch McConnell, who wants to take away his health security just as he finally gets it, or for Alison Lundergan Grimes, who won't (no matter how squishy she might currently be on the issue).
And if the GOP's last bastion of support starts liking the law, and as a result, Democrats, just imagine what might happen amongst more swingy demographics. What about married women, who lean GOP, but might suddenly see their families insured? What about Republican-leaning Gen-Xers hitting middle-age, were health issues become more prominent in their lives?
The fight for Obamacare has become an existentialist crisis for the GOP. And Ronald Hudson in Breathitt County, Kentucky, is turning that nightmare into reality.
Update: As pointed out in the comments, Breathitt County goes Democratic when there isn't an Obama on the ballot. Even in the 2010 GOP wave, Jack Conway won the county over Rand Paul. That doesn't change the gist of this post.

Lots of different topics on the agenda today. First up, The Washington Post on Russia's discriminatory acts towards the LGBT community:
While Russia and the Soviet Union before it have generally been hostile to gay people, the recent intensity of Mr. Putin’s war is part and parcel of his lapse into xenophobia, religious chauvinism and general intolerance as the urban middle class increasingly questions the legitimacy of his authoritarian rule. But if Mr. Putin believed that persecution of gay people would be a domestic issue of little interest to the world, he miscalculated. As Mr. Obama rightly highlighted, the dignity with which gays are treated has been recognized as a fundamental human rights concern in much of the world. No country, especially not one on the cusp of hosting the Olympic Games, should expect such bigotry to go unnoticed.
Meanwhile, Paul Krugman at The New York Times:
We live in a golden age of economic debunkery; fallacious doctrines have been dropping like flies. No, monetary expansion needn’t cause hyperinflation. No, budget deficits in a depressed economy don’t cause soaring interest rates. No, slashing spending doesn’t create jobs. No, economic growth doesn’t collapse when debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P.
And now the latest myth bites the dust: No, “economic policy uncertainty” — created, it goes without saying, by That Man in the White House — isn’t holding back the recovery.

Head below the fold for more on the day's top stories.


Michael McGough at The Los Angeles Times examines the GOP's media intimidation:
My guess is  that Priebus' real concern has nothing to do with pro-Hillary collusion between NBC News and NBC Entertainment. He just doesn't want Hillary Clinton, the presumptive favorite for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, to get extra air time, adulatory or otherwise, as the election season approaches.
But is that really a big concern in this multiplatform age? Surely we've progressed past the time when people worried that Arnold Schwarzenegger the politician would receive some unfair political advantage if ""Terminator"" were rerun on TV (as if susceptible voters couldn't watch it on a DVD). And isn't it patronizing to suggest that voters could be manipulated by a miniseries or a documentary?
The best answer to Preibus' complaint is that, whatever her political prospects, Hillary Rodham Clinton is a historical figure with a fascinating personal backstory. That she's also a potential candidate for president doesn't change those facts. So let the cameras roll. And rather than agonize about whether  the movies will mess with their brand, reporters at CNN and NBC should focus on covering the 2016 campaign fairly.

On the topic of the GOP's fit over upcoming Hillary Clinton documentaries, Andrew Rosenthal at The New York Times says the controversy is ridiculous:
Presidential debates have not been debates for a long time. In the primaries, they’re cattle shows where a half dozen or more would-be nominees recite talking points hoping for a sound bite that sticks for 24 hours. In the general election, they’re press conferences with two participants trying to avoid stepping on landmines. The most memorable moments have had less to do with substantive discussion than appearance, like President Obama sleepwalking through his first encounter with Mitt Romney in 2012.
But even from that low starting point, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, has dragged the idea of presidential debates farther down.  [...] On one level, Mr. Priebus is right. Debate moderators have not been people whose interest was promoting the Republicans or their nominees. They have been journalists whose interest was in asking questions dispassionately.
That’s how it is supposed to be. If the Mr. Priebus wants debate moderators to lob softballs designed to let the candidates look good and avoid areas that might hurt them, he should just give Fox News an exclusive.

Switching topics to immigration, Brad Bannon at U.S. News says the GOP's digging its own grave:
The Republican House caucus has probably stopped comprehensive immigration reform this year. If the GOP succeeds in blocking the path to citizenship for immigrants, the Republicans will fail at the polls next year. When Republicans aren't blocking reform legislation, they spend their time trying to kill reforms that are already law. House Republicans have now voted 40 times to kill the Affordable Care Act,  which Hispanic Americans support in large numbers.
The GOP's electoral problems extend far beyond Hispanic voters. A national poll that CBS conducted in July indicated that Americans are much more concerned about the economy (40 percent) than the budget deficit (16 percent), or anything else for that matter. By focusing like a laser beam on the deficit, the GOP is blissfully ignoring the problem that concerns large numbers of voters. Meanwhile President Obama has spent the last two weeks on the road, talking about the economy.

On the topic of education, Mark Edmunson says majoring in humanities has its benefits:
the humanities are not about success. They’re about questioning success — and every important social value. Socrates taught us this, and we shouldn’t forget it. Sure, someone who studies literature or philosophy is learning to think clearly and write well. But those skills are means to an end. That end, as Plato said, is learning how to live one’s life. “This discussion is not about any chance question,” Plato’s Socrates says in “The Republic,” “but about the way one should live.”
That’s what’s at the heart of the humanities — informed, thoughtful dialogue about the way we ought to conduct life. This dialogue honors no pieties: All positions are debatable; all values are up for discussion.

Finally, former teacher Elliot Haspel tied a thread between housing policy, poverty and education:
Teaching should be among the most respected professions. Teachers should be paid extremely well, and they should have tremendous amounts of support, resources and quality professional development. Teachers should bring out the creative spark in children. Teachers should help students gain high levels of rigorous knowledge and skills. And teachers should be held to high standards that look at how they and their students perform on a variety of measures, year after year. These “shoulds” build on one another; they do not tear one another down.
For low-income children and parents, there are many comprehensive services that can help level the playing field, and not just academically. Housing policy is education policy. Transportation policy is education policy. Health-care policy is education policy. Criminal justice policy is education policy. Food policy is education policy. And, yes, education policy is education policy. I do not know anyone involved in the education reform movement worth his salt who thinks that schools are the sole answer; I do not know anyone opposed to the education reform movement worth her salt who thinks schools don’t matter. [...]
There’s only one divide that matters: the one between those who believe all kids can succeed regardless of the circumstances of their birth and the color of their skin, and those who don’t.

The extremist tea party wing of the Republican Party—aka ""Teapublicans""—who are currently holding the government and citizens of the United States hostage with threats of economic terrorism are certainly equal opportunity haters.
Yes, I'm using the word ""hate"" to describe what seems to motivate much of what they have wrought. It's ironic coming from a group that is largely and ostensibly ""Christian,"" given that their actions are the antithesis of the love-based theology of Jesus. Even more ironic, since they claim to be patriots and do a lot of flag-waving and talking about how much they love America.  
My focus over the years has primarily been on their racism, their open visceral rejection of a black president, but that is too narrow a lens through which to view all of the people their hate is bringing harm to. Their actions go beyond mere Obama Derangement Syndrome.
Most of the folks in their cross-hairs are white, and contrary to the impression given by their propaganda many are Republicans. Anyone who does not share their warped and twisted views of “their America” will now be forced to suffer.
So take a good hard look at the people who were elected to serve in a government they have vowed to destroy and all of the groups who have fallen afoul of their vengeance, those who are going to be made to pay and pay, to suffer by the actions taken by this deranged minority group.
It's a long list—and I'm probably leaving some groups out—but follow me below the fold to view it:


Government workers
Women (unless they are supporting patriarchy)
Blacks (AfricanAmericans as well as African and Caribbean immigrants)
Latinos (especially those who are not Cuban-American anti-Fidelistias)
Asians and Asian-Pacific Islanders
Native Americans
LBGT’s (Log Cabin Republicans beware)
Union members
Immigrants (documented and undocumented, who are visibly non-white)
Jews
Muslims
Sikhs and Hindus (because from a hater's perspective they are no different from Muslims)
Atheists
The elderly
The disabled
Children in Head Start
Moms, infants and children on WIC
People with pre-existing health conditions
People who need food and food stamps (America's hungry)
People living from paycheck to paycheck
Farmers
Scientists
Active duty military, vets and their families
People who believe in climate change
People who believe in evolution
Environmentalists
People whose income depends on tourism to national parks
Teachers/educators
Librarians and students (book bannings are being called for)
The media (unless it is FAUX-news or hate radio personalities)
Democrats—liberal, centrist or conservative
The incarcerated (all two million of them) and correction officers
In other words—the vast majority of folks in the U.S seem to fall into some group Teapublicans are taking out their ire upon.
It’s amazing to me when I add up the numbers.

My first face-to-face encounter with Teapublicans was back in 2010, in my neighboring town of Kingston, New York, which I wrote about in a piece called ""Social Justice is Tyranny,"" the title taken from one of the many signs held up by people with hate-filled faces.
Trying to talk to them was futile. They were opposed to paying taxes, yet wanted the government to keep its dirty hands off their Medicare. They had been fed on a steady diet of anti-government sentiment and conspiracy theories from Faux News. Their heroes are the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs of the world.
I had a strong feeling then that we were going to be in trouble as a nation if these people, and people like them, were going to elect representatives who held their views. Yes, they didn't win the presidency (twice), but their elected cabal in Congress could care less. They don't recognize him as legitimate.
These people are not rich. They depend on government services. Yet their hate, deeply rooted in fear, keeps them from voting in their own interest.
Democracy Corps' ""Republican Party Project"" has recently issued a report from focus groups conducted with the three main factions that currently comprise a majority of the Republican Party, which helps to illuminate the forces behind the Teapublican shutdown:
Evangelicals. Social issues are central for Evangelicals and they feel a deep sense of cultural and political loss. They believe their towns, communities, and schools are suffering from a deep “culture rot” that has invaded from the outside. The central focus here is homosexuality, but also the decline of homogenous small towns. They like the Tea Party because they stand up to the Democrats.
Tea Party. Big government, Obama, the loss of liberty, and decline of responsibility are central to the Tea Party worldview. Obama’s America is an unmitigated evil based on big government, regulations, and dependency.  They are not focused on social issues at all. They like the Tea Party because it is getting “back to basics” and believe it has the potential to reshape the GOP.
Moderates. Moderates are deeply concerned with the direction of the country and believe Obama has taken it down the wrong path economically. They are centrally focused on market-based economics, small government, and eliminating waste and inefficiency. They are largely open to progressive social policies, including on gay marriage and immigration. They disdain the Tea Party and have a hard time taking Fox News seriously.

In the analysis of the focus group results (PDF) they point out:
And while few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, the base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities. Their party is losing to a Democratic Party of big government whose goal is to expand programs that mainly benefit minorities. Race remains very much alive in the politics of the Republican Party.
The first two groups are holding any elected moderate Republicans (a minority) hostage, just as they hold all of us hostage to their obsessions, paranoia, and hate.
The most important thing we each can do is fight this in every district currently controlled by Teapublicans.
MoveOn/PPP has identified seats that could be vulnerable:
Twenty-four new surveys in GOP-held House districts, commissioned by MoveOn.org and conducted in the wake of the government shutdown, make clear that Republicans could easily lose control of the House if the next election were held today. The surveys challenge conventional wisdom that gerrymandering has put the House out of reach for Democrats and indicate the shutdown has significant electoral implications.
Yes, 2014 elections are a year away.
We have to put in the footwork now, registering new voters, fighting voter disenfranchisement efforts and making plans to get voters to the polls.

Good going, dude!



Good going, dude!

Over two years ago, I penned a piece here calling for a direct challenge to the intentions of the Republican Party. It espoused the theory that the failures of conservative governance and policies were being masked by an existing narrative in the minds of voters that the Republican Party was that of patriotism, tradition, and small-town American values.
It's an image that the conservative movement had done an excellent job of cultivating since the September 11 terrorist attacks. In the narrative they promoted, they were the true American patriots who would preserve the country's values and keep it safe from harm, while the Democratic faction that opposed them was at best feckless, and at worst bent on surrendering and letting the terrorists win. And even as corruption, a failed occupation, incompetence and financial collapse swept Democrats back into power in 2006 and 2008, many Republicans still campaigned continuously on the narrative of putting America first, especially in contrast to supporters of Barack Hussein Obama.
That story, however, may now be at the end of its arc. More below.


If the tea party faction thought that they could lay claim to the idea of representing ""real America"" by dressing up in colonial clothes and calling President Obama some sort of foreigner, that idea is now out the window. After the Republican-controlled House of Representatives decided to shut down the government in a desperate attempt to take away the ability of the less fortunate to get health insurance, their polling took a major hit. Over half the country now thinks that it's a bad thing that the Republican Party controls the House; three quarters of Americans believe that Republican members of Congress don't deserve re-election.
All of those numbers would be bad in their own right, but there's one that's even worse, as Steve Benen at MSNBC reports:
The results cover quite a bit of ground, but there was one question in particular that stood out for me: respondents were asked whether they believe the various officials in Washington are more interested in doing what’s best for the country or what’s best for themselves politically. It’s an interesting question because it speaks to something that isn’t often polled: perceptions of motivations.
I put together the chart above to capture the results, which should terrify Republican officials. By a nearly four-to-one margin, Americans believe GOP lawmakers in Congress aren’t concerned with the nation’s best interests. That’s just astounding.

Given the revulsion that the American public feels toward Congress in general, it's unsurprising that Democrats on Capitol Hill are operating at a deficit in this regard as well, even if it isn't nearly as steep as that faced by their Republican counterparts. But what should scare Republicans even more than their own abysmal numbers? President Obama's. Despite every single thing that Republicans have said and done to delegitimize the President, ascribe evil intentions to him, and impute that he does not share American values, a majority of Americans think that he cares about what is best for the country more than being motivated by selfish intentions.
Yet despite these drastically horrible numbers, some in the tea party faction seem predisposed to favor yet another shutdown, yet another hostage fight with President Obama as the country's economic future hangs in the balance. If that is indeed what they choose to do, the message is very simple: this group of House Republicans simply does not care about this country and its people. It's a stark message, but the polling bears out its resonance. Even though the midterm elections are over a year away, Democrats have the best opportunity they have had in many years to permanently damage the opposing brand.
The specifics of policy positions are relevant to this opportunity, of course; but far more relevant is the simple fact that House Republicans have placed their political vendettas over the well-being of the country as a whole. The American public no longer trust that these Republicans are the type of people who want to do the right thing, and that is far bigger than any policy issue.

I noticed some folks here at DailyKos have taken an interest in DFA's new Purple to Blue program (particular thanks to lowkell for the great write-up), so I want to share a message I sent to DFA members earlier this week. I encourage everyone to get involved.
The right-wing's stranglehold on state houses across the country is a real problem progressives need to address -- Republicans don't need Congress to push their radical right-wing agenda. They're doing it right now, on the state level, in states across the country:
 -- Ending women's right to choose
 -- Busting unions
 -- Deregulating industries and pillaging the environment
 -- Giving away huge tax breaks to big corporations and the super rich
Needless to say, we need to stop their radical agendas before they go any farther.
That's why DFA is launching the Purple to Blue Project, a new multi-year effort dedicated to winning state House and Senate chambers across the country -- starting right now in Virginia.

You can pitch in. Help us raise $60,000 by March 31st to kick this program off right by chipping in $15 or more today.


Even as Democrats picked up wins nationally last year, conservatives continued to cement control of state legislatures -- and they're using states like Virginia to build momentum for radical, extreme agendas.
We're seeing the damage they can do. Virginia's newly-enacted restrictions on abortion have spawned a national assault on women's right to make decisions about her own life: BOLD: just last weekend, North Dakota's Republican-controlled legislature passed a ""personhood"" amendment, effectively banning all abortions in the state.
Whether it's stripping away labor rights in Wisconsin, restricting voting rights in Pennsylvania, or attacking a woman's right to choose in Virginia, conservatives are growing bolder and reaching further than ever before.
It's time to get back to basics. DFA is targeting five swing districts in Virginia to send a powerful message to Republicans: If you continue to wage war on our core values, progressives will defeat you at the ballot box.
This isn't a process that will happen overnight , but we have to start now. We're endorsing our first round of candidates -- now we need to raise $60,000 to begin recruiting staff to join them in the field.

Even a gift of $15 or more will help get us to that goal.

Wow! What a raging jagoff! So I'm sure you recall that the other day, Mark Sanford had the brilliant idea to run a full-page newspaper ad filled with an incredibly lengthy and self-serving series of b.s. explanations for why he trespassed at his ex-wife's home, followed by a whole lot of moaning about negative ads being run by Democrats, and capped off with a comparison of his situation to that of the men who defended the Alamo (who, of course, almost all died). In the middle, though, Sanford made this bizarre offer:

""Desperate"" and ""weird"" hardly begin to describe it, but one of the groups whose ads Sanford complained about, the House Majority PAC, decided to take him up on it. In a post-script to a fundraising email, they reprinted Sanford's cell phone number and suggested that their supporters ""[g]ive him a call and ask why he spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on luxury travel."" A number of them did just that, so guess what Sanford did in response?
He published the phone numbers of the people who called him. These are ordinary citizens—perhaps a little brasher than average—but I'm sure they had no expectation that their numbers would get printed on Mark Sanford's campaign website. I don't want to even link to the document Sanford originally posted, but here's a redacted version, and to be clear, every black box you see obscures a number that Sanford had no problem reproducing in full:

You'll notice that all the numbers are from out-of-state, so I'm guessing Sanford wanted to make some kind of point that no one from South Carolina cared to ring him up—though iPhone users can prune their call logs, so Sanford may have erased any Palmetto State callers. Of course, the more important point is that Mark Sanford is an absolute schmuckface for publicizing the personal information of average Americans who had the temerity to take him up on his offer to talk to him. Sadly, though, that's hardly a surprise. I guess the only real question is, did he ever even answer the phone?

In the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina, where a Republican nominee can lose some usual Republican voters and still get elected, if there's one clear message that can interpreted from the results from tonight's special election, it's that Republicans have fully embraced adultery and corruption.
Mark Sanford fits both the ""adulterer"" and ""crook"" label, yet Republicans in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives anyways.
He disappeared for nearly a week during his second term as Governor of South Carolina and, when he returned to the United States, revealed that he had been unfaithful to his then-wife Jenny Sanford. It was later revealed that he had flown to Argentina and had an affair with the woman that he is now engaged to.
Sanford settled 37 ethics charges that stemmed from his affair and he paid the largest ethics fine in South Carolina history after settling the charges.
Democrats, with the exceptions of Charlie Rangel, Alcee Hastings, and some others, tend to disown those who tarnish the Democratic brand...Jesse Jackson Jr., John Edwards, William Jefferson, Herman Talamadge, Rod Blagojevich, Dan Rostenkowski, Chuck Chvala, and others who have tarnished the Democratic brand for adultery and/or corruption are regarded as persona non grata in the Democratic Party these days, or, in the case of Talamadge, would be persona non grata in the Democratic Party if he were alive today.
Republicans, with some exceptions, tend to admire those who tarnish their brand...Newt Gingrich, David Vitter, Spencer Bachus, and now Mark Sanford, just to name a few. As a matter of fact, Howie Klein of Down With Tyranny is reporting that Mark Foley is considering a redemption run for public office of his own, although I'm not sure if that's merely a joke by Klein or if Foley is actually considering a return to politics.
For another observation I've made from tonight's special election in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina, look below the orange squiggle.


Another observation that I've been able to make from the results in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina is a key difference between how Democrats view the undue influence of money in politics and how Republicans view the undue influence of money in politics.
Democrats, for the most part, tend to support measures, up to and including efforts to amend the United States Constitution, to reduce the influence of money in American politics, particularly when it comes to the unlimited amounts of money that can be raised and spent by so-called ""SuperPACs"" as a result of the Citizens United vs. FEC Supreme Court case. While there are some Democrats who believe that Democratic front groups shouldn't raise unlimited amounts of money or not even run campaign ads at all, there are many Democrats, such as myself, who support changing the laws in order to reduce the influence of money in politics but are willing to allow Democratic outside groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on races until the rules are changed to prohibit that.
Republicans, for the most part, tend to embrace the concept of outside groups spending unlimited amounts of money unless, of course, it's used by Democrats against Republican candidates. Additionally, Republicans are unwilling to support measures to reduce the influence of money in American politics, but few Republicans are willing to openly admit that they support the concept of outside groups being able to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. The fact that Democratic front groups spent a large amount of money in an attempt to win the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina provoked a hostile reaction among Republican voters who were willing to either support Democratic candidate Elizabeth Colbert-Busch or not vote in protest of Sanford winning the Republican nomination but ultimately voted for Sanford.

Who would have figured that Republican efforts at minority outreach have not been entirely sincere?
There is not a single racial minority among the 20 most senior officials who run the Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee, and National Republican Senatorial Committee — the three wings of the GOP apparatus charged with promoting candidates and winning elections. […]
One former RNC field staffer, who is Hispanic, described a culture of cynicism among his predominantly white colleagues when it came to minority outreach. He said that in his office, whenever they were notified of a new Republican outreach effort, they would pass around a Beanie Baby — which they had dubbed the ""pander bear"" — and make fun of the ""tokenism.""

No, really!
He also recalled a Mitt Romney rally last year featuring Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, during which the staffer and his coworkers were tasked with finding Hispanics in the crowd who they could place on stage for the benefit of the TV cameras. It's a common, bipartisan practice in campaign politics — but one that his colleagues resented.
""My white peers were clearly not understanding what a powerful image a Hispanic senator standing in front of a sea of Hispanic Romney supporters would be,"" he said. ""They grumbled about it, treated it like a chore. Not racist or anything like that, just didn't understand why they were doing it.""

Anytime you have to explain to someone that your crowd is ""not racist,"" but, you may have a problem. Anytime you try to hold a panel discussion on how not to be a racist only to have it interrupted by racists, you may have a problem. Anytime your minority outreach efforts have been assigned their own mocking Beanie Baby mascot by the office staff, you might just have a problem. (Then again, asking staffers to go out and find Hispanic Mitt Romney supporters in the crowd does sound like a special kind of torture.)
This points to the rather awkward problem faced by the GOP in their new ""minority outreach"" efforts. They know they're insincere, and everyone else knows they're insincere, so the entire episode has the element of farce built into it from the get-go. While Reince Preibus touts his new $10 million plan to have actual Republicans go out and talk to actual black and brown people, $10 million is not much of an ad budget when the rest of your organization has gone all-out on mocking and despising the very concept of diversity for more decades than most of your target audience has been alive.
Also a core part of this story: The ongoing cat fight between ex-RNC chair Michael Steele and the suit-wearing pickled egg that took over that slot, Reince Preibus. Steele's obvious disgust at Preibus and, by extension, the entire party apparatus propping him up gets funnier the longer it goes on.

Short version: McCain says Hagel sucks because he was mean to Bush



Short version: McCain says Hagel sucks because he was mean to Bush

Yesterday, Senate Republicans blocked a vote on former Sen. Chuck Hagel's nomination to be secretary of defense, marking the first time in American history that any nominee for defense secretary has been filibustered. But don't worry, they had a very good reason to launch their historic act of destructive obstruction. Sen. John McCain, please take it away:
It goes back to there’s a lot of ill will towards Senator Hagel because when he was a Republican, he attacked President Bush mercilessly and said he was the worst President since Herbert Hoover and said the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War, which was nonsense. He was anti-his own party and people — people don’t forget that.
In other words, this is about Republicans defending their honor by standing up for George W. Bush and the Iraq War. It would be unbelievable, except these are the same guys who brought you George W. Bush and the Iraq War. And now, unlike Hagel who at least recognized his bad judgment for supporting W. and Iraq, virtually all Republicans are still committed to defending their incredibly damaging record.
But, as we'll see below the fold, there appears to be another reason McCain blocked Hagel: he didn't like being cc'd on a letter. He denies this, but take a look at the facts and decide for yourself.


As BuzzFeed's Rebecca Berg explains, on Thursday morning McCain denied having received a letter he had requested from the White House about Benghazi:
""I have not received the letter,"" McCain told CNN Thursday morning. ""They sent the letter to Sen. Levin. It was Sen Graham and I and Ayotte that asked for an answer. We haven't received an answer.""
In the interview, he said the letter's delay was a chief reason he was holding up a vote on Hagel's nomination.
""I have to receive a letter, I have to receive a letter, see whether I receive a letter or not, and there are other questions that other senators have raised which are not answered as well,"" McCain told CNN.

So McCain said he was upset that Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) had received a letter with answers to his questions, but that he hadn't received it. Fair enough, except the thing is, McCain actually had received the letter—the very same letter that had been sent to Sen. Levin. The only catch: McCain had been cc'd.
The White House responded to McCain's concern by sending the exact same letter it had already sent to him, but this time it put him on the ""To:"" line and cc'd Levin. Problem solved, right? Sure, except by Thursday afternoon McCain had decided the reason Republicans were filibustering Hagel is that they are bitter about him saying they were wrong to support George W. Bush and Iraq.
This is all a dark comedy, really. Actually, more like a tragedy, because all this nonsense could have been avoided if a handful of Democrats hadn't killed filibuster reform last month. That's a mistake they can fix, however. Please sign the petition to tell Harry Reid: Re-open filibuster reform in light of continued Republican obstructionism.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott

If this isn't crooked, it's only because we've defined crookedness down so much that it doesn't exist anymore:
Two months after contributing $110,000 to Gov. Rick Scott's re-election campaign, an upstart property insurance company is likely to reap a $52 million windfall, paid from the coffers of Citizens Property Insurance Corp.
Here's the deal. Citizens Property Insurance Corp. is a state-run Florida insurance company. Because Florida has hit a lucky streak over the last years and not had as much hurricane damage as they had feared, they're sitting on a cash surplus of $6.4 billion dollars. But that surplus could go away if a devastating hurricane season does hit, and (shudder) there's even the possibility that a future bad hurricane could force the state to raise taxes to pay for the damage, so the governing state Republicans have a great plan to deal with that: They'll pay private companies to take profitable policies off their hands. (The premise is that this will mitigate possible losses later, presumably because if any of these smaller, privatized insurance companies were to later fail the state would tell disaster victims that were clients of those smaller firms to piss off.)
In this particular case, that has led to that not-too-unique special business flower: A new company apparently formed specifically to go after a single government contract and reap the rewards, and whose bid for the free government money consists in large part of investing in politicians:
Sitting on a record cash surplus of $6.4 billion, Citizens is hoping to sign a special deal today with Heritage Property and Casualty Insurance Co., a St. Petersburg firm that opened nine months ago and has made significant political contributions.
Heritage has donated more than $140,000 to Scott and the Republican Party of Florida in recent months, and spent tens of thousands more lobbying the Legislature.

A nine-month-old company that's donated $140,000 to Rick Scott and the Republican Party, and which is now suddenly in line for $52 million in government money? Wow. That's not at all crooked-sounding. Note, especially, that Heritage donated its first $30,000 to the Florida GOP only two months after the company was founded—and the other $110,000 to Rick Scott just two months ago, while Heritage was in the midst of lobbying Scott and state legislators for the contract.
This isn't even a one-time thing:
It's the second time this year Citizens is looking to subsidize an upstart private insurer using its massive surplus, which has been built up over seven years as the state has dodged hurricanes. In February, Citizens' board approved a deal with Weston Insurance, agreeing to pay the young company $63 million to take out 30,000 policies. Weston has spent more than $250,000 on lobbying this year, and two of Citizens' seven board members abstained from voting because of conflicts of interest.
There's even more sketchiness to all this, including an apparent government-to-private-sector revolving door racket by one of the participants. If nobody ends up in jail because of this then it's Florida's own fault. You elect crooks to write your laws, they're going to write crooked laws.

My cousin, a solid Republican from an extremely right-wing Republican family (he's actually fine on social issues, and is very progressive on environmental/alternative energy issues) just posted a bombshell post on Facebook.
I posted his screed and my response to him a couple of days ago, and at the time I kept his name out of it since I wasn't sure how public it was; however, given that he's re-posted it to at least 3 other local Republican-oriented Facebook pages, and given that the comment section has broken out into a spirited debate, I'm reposting with the direct link this time.
As far as I can tell, the incident that pushed him into finally posting a public chastisement of the local GOP was the most-recent meeting of the county party, in which the party leadership decided to once again ignore the pleas of non-Christian members and insist on invoking only Jesus/Christ-our-Lord-and-Savior in the opening invocation. According to a fellow Jewish member of the OCRP, it sounds like they may have decided to ""appease"" the Jewish members by having a ""Rabbi"" speak...except that the ""Rabbi"" was actually a member of ""Jews for Jesus"" which is, if anything, even more offensive to Jewish people.
(I'm not 100% sure about this; the wording of her comment is a bit hard to follow, but that seems to be the gist of it).
Anyway, here's his post, which is causing quite a stir with the local GOP membership:


My Broken Republican Party
I write this note with sadness and optimism. My local Republican Party is broken. My comments may be harsh at times but are only meant to shine a light on some of our issues in order to make positive changes. I have been involved in Oakland Country Republican's for nearly 10 years. I have run in the past three elections. Two years ago, I made sure that no county commission seat went without someone running. I currently and proudly sit on the Executive Board of the County Party. I am a socially liberal, fiscally conservative Republican. Unfortunately our party has decided by their actions that they do not care about getting all branches of our local communities to vote and be proud to be Republican.
This past Thursday February 7th we had our County Convention. I have seen the conventions become smaller and smaller. I often wonder why I bother myself.  Lack of inclusion is the issue at the heart of why we continue to get crushed in elections locally. Oakland Country is made up of voters from all different belief systems and religions. The Republican Party should be about fiscal responsibility, not about the moral views of some.
Inclusiveness is no small issue. We have painted ourselves into a small box. We don't garner the Jewish, Black, Hispanic, Muslim, Gay... and the list goes on. One has to wonder-- is there some truth when we are called a bigoted party?
We used be a big tent. There was lots of different views represented and discussed. We have become single minded, and bent on squashing dissension. People who used to be called Conservative Republican's are now called moderates or “Rhinos”. The Libertarian wing has been marginalized. We have successfully kicked out the log-cabin Republican's. I can't image why Jews and Blacks don't want to associate with our Party.
Change must happen and quickly. If we hope to survive and be a majority party, we must be inclusive.
I would be happy to address any specifics and some thoughts on how to achieve a welcoming party that can compete and win elections.
Ezra Drissman
Executive Board Member
Oakland County Republican Party

(I should note, by the way, that I'm not entirely sure what he means by the GOP getting ""crushed in local elections""...the GOP did lose both the County Clerk and County Water Commissioner positions in November, along with a few other spots, but they still control the County Commission, Executive and Sheriff offices, and retain complete control of everything at the state level...for the moment...but that's a separate issue)
I've posted a few follow-ups, but this was my initial response:
I thought about ""Liking"" this, but I figured that would seem like gloating or rubbing it in, which is not my intention. I actually used to be an independent, and while my views were always left of center, I did occasionally vote for a Republican (I think I voted for Shelly Taub once, mostly because she was a friend of the family). I became a Democrat about 10 years ago mostly due to disgust with the trends I was seeing on the Republican side of the aisle--I felt that events were forcing everyone to choose a side, and I sure as hell knew who I didn't want to stand with. Everything I've seen since then has only served to reinforce that decision.
As an obvious example, the truth that most Republicans (and, ironically, most Democrats) can't seem to accept is that, for example, Barack Obama would actually have been considered a moderate Republican only 20 years ago, even on economic issues. The ACA (Obamacare) was actually written by the Heritage Foundation, is almost identical to the plan touted by Newt Gingrich (and of course is based on the one passed by Mitt Romney), and so on. He's actually increased the number of illegal immigrant deporations, and of course there's been a lot of concern of late over his use of drone strikes in Pakistan; hardly the picture of a ""far-left"" President.
At the same time, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush raised taxes, and Reagan and Gerald Ford both supported the original assault weapons ban, among other things.
And yet the GOP has become almost blind with frothing-mouth rage at everything that President Obama has done for the past 6 years (starting well before his first term).
While I may be a solid Democrat these days, I actually do not want the Republican Party to fall apart; complete single-party rule is not healthy in the long run. I want at least two parties (preferably more, but let's be realistic) that seriously debate the issues of the day in an intelligent and fact-based fashion, and while the Dems certainly have their nutbags and extremists, they haven't completely taken over the party, which--in all honesty--seems to be the case with the GOP.
I say this not with any glee or satisfaction, but with deep concern. I'm glad to see that at least a few individuals such as yourself are starting to see what's happened to your party.
I wish you luck, in all sincerity.

The comments are quite telling.

Pssst. Michele. You might want to pay your staff before they spill even more of your dirty little secrets.

Today in why you shouldn't treat your staff badly, then refuse to pay them when they refuse to retroactively agree to aid and abet your potentially criminal activities, we have this juicy little nugget from Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed:
Michelle [sic] Bachmann's high-profile debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, developed an ""unnatural"" and ""Rasputin-like"" relationship with his candidate during her failed 2012 presidential campaign, another former aide told BuzzFeed, a charge O'Donnell denies.
The former aide who's keeping us entertained with the trash-talking is Peter Waldron—the same Peter Waldron who's had an awful lot to say lately about his former employer:
Peter Waldron, her controversial former national field coordinator, told Salon the dispute started when former Iowa straw poll staffers refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would bar them from discussing any “unethical, immoral, or criminal activity” they witnessed on the campaign with police or reporters. [...]
Waldron said the staffers are owed a mere $5,000, and that Bachmann has more than $2 million in her campaign account, but has refused to pay unless the staffers sign the agreement.

Of course, that whole refusing-to-pay-staff thing was last week's news. This week, Waldron is regaling us with tales of how easily Bachmann was apparently brainwashed by her debate coach who, Waldron says, had an ""unusual power over Mrs. Bachmann."" How powerful was he? This powerful:
""He prohibited her husband, Dr. Marcus Bachmann, from sleeping in the same room with wife while on the campaign trail,"" Waldron said in an email to BuzzFeed.
Marcus was no doubt heartbroken about that.
Too bad Michele Bachmann is so busy still trying to repeal Obamacare instead of keeping her former campaign staffers happy. Probably a bad idea to screw them over when they're obviously sitting on a goldmine of gossip—and potentially criminal activities—about the queen of batshit crazy.
Tell the FEC to investigate the alleged crimes of Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign.

Gary Bauer, while running for president in 2000.

A few weeks ago I put together this handy chart of the various components of the GOP coalition. While we already know that the various factions have their own pet issues and causes, the current GOP civil war is exposing the actual distaste the various groups have for each other.
Jed already hit the Christian Right's whining of Republicans abandoning them on marriage equality. But I want to refocus on Gary Bauer's comments, because they go beyond simple grousing over a wayward coalition partner:
""If we gave our voters an accurate portrayal of our ideas, that we want to cut the rate of growth on Social Security, give tax cuts to billionaires and then the values issues, the values issues would be more popular than the economic agenda of the current Republican Party,” said [social conservative leader Gary] Bauer...
Ignore the fact that there's nothing popular about the GOP's ""values."" Just note how he portrays his party's economic agenda:
give tax cuts to billionaires
That's how we liberals frame the Mitt Romney wing of the GOP. Economic conservatives might pretend that there's more to them than tax cuts for billionaires, but even their own partners disagree. And Bauer can't even be bothered to pretend otherwise anymore.
That's not a characterization that suggests mutual respect and agreement, but one of barely disguised disgust. Theirs is a marriage of convenience—the Gordon Geckos don't care for the Bible Thumbers, the Bible Thumpers don't care for the Gordon Geckos. And now that their collective suck isn't leading to White House victories, the knives are out.
Funny thing is, both those sides are equally to blame for the GOP's woes. Mitt Romney conservatism (aka ""tax cuts for billionaires"") is as unpopular as Rick Santorum conservatism (aka ""hate the gays""). They need each other to amount to something, but that's no longer a nationally viable party.

Yep. It's so downright amazing that even Rachel Maddow picked it up.
Monday at 9AM was the first time the new and not-so-improved Watauga County Board of Elections met, a Board now controlled by Republican Tea Partiers (2-1) with a clear mission to suppress any and all suspected progressive votes in time for the upcoming municipal elections, especially for the Town of Boone, the county seat. And to do it undercover as fast as possible.
While the meeting had originally been scheduled for a large room in the County's Administration building, the Republicans quickly changed the location to a small Board room in the elections office in an effort to discourage public attendance. Didn't work. Before the two Republicans were forced to move meeting, as required by law in light of all the people there to witness the travesty, just wet your whistle with what went down at the start. Seriously. Take a look at this. It will blow your mind.



There's a lot of local backstory associated with this story, but the short and skinny is that these two meathead Republican Board members came to the meeting with a prepared-but clearly-not-by-them Tea Party agenda to:
1. Eliminate the Appalachian State University (ASU) early one-stop voting site.
2. Force all early voting into one location hard to access by students, faculty, and staff at ASU.
3. Outlaw any verbal public comment at Board meetings and require that written comments be screened to ensure they were ""pertinent"" and communicated without cussing or libel.
4. Require that the 27-year Elections Board Director, a woman totally on the straight up and beloved by the entire county, not be allowed to meet with anyone in her office without supervision.
5. Mandate that anyone calling into the local BOE office have their names recorded.
6. Move the ""New River"" precinct (a heavily populated precinct in and around the town of Boone) out into the very corner of the precinct into a virtually unknown location and as far away from municipal voters as possible.
7. Combine three Boone precincts into one Super Precinct consisting of 9,300 voters and 35 parking spaces. Oh. And away as far as possible from ASU.
The crowd of 60 plus (considerable for our little Town) was pissed as hell. We're talking screaming, yelling, booing, ""shame on you,"" ""what are you trying to hide,"".... At one point one of the Republican meatheads threatened to have the public arrested. The response from the crowd was an immediate ""bring it on."" Here's the initial local press account.
If you've got an hour, grab a cup of coffee (or a beer and an sandwich) and check out the video from the rest of the meeting. It's. worth. every. inch. of. your. time. But I can't embed it.
Now let's face it. A lot of small county Democratic parties would just give it all up right then and there. Afterall, what good would an appeal to the State Board of Elections do? That Board, appointed by Governor McCrory (in other words Art Pope) is also controlled by right-wingers, bent on not just drowning state progressives, but chopping them off at the head first.
Unfortunately for them our local Democratic Party just by nature ain't so inclined to go quietly into that good night. And before they can chop off our heads, we're determined to drag them to shore for all to see.
We've put 24/7 into fighting back against all odds, and while we know that in the end we are unlikely to be able to overturn the local Board's decision, we are still at it. The lone Democrat on the Board, Kathleen Campbell, has put in a petition to the state. The NAACP is now looking into our fight, and Common Cause has formally urged Governor McCrory to get involved. After all, he said earlier this week that it was wrong for partisan politics to be a factor in selecting precincts. The Mayor of Boone has written a scathing letter to the Chairman of the State Board of Elections.
We're bringing the evil into the light anywhere and everywhere.
And thanks to Rachel Maddow for putting our fight on the national map.

In the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina, where a Republican nominee can lose some usual Republican voters and still get elected, if there's one clear message that can interpreted from the results from tonight's special election, it's that Republicans have fully embraced adultery and corruption.
Mark Sanford fits both the ""adulterer"" and ""crook"" label, yet Republicans in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina elected him to the U.S. House of Representatives anyways.
He disappeared for nearly a week during his second term as Governor of South Carolina and, when he returned to the United States, revealed that he had been unfaithful to his then-wife Jenny Sanford. It was later revealed that he had flown to Argentina and had an affair with the woman that he is now engaged to.
Sanford settled 37 ethics charges that stemmed from his affair and he paid the largest ethics fine in South Carolina history after settling the charges.
Democrats, with the exceptions of Charlie Rangel, Alcee Hastings, and some others, tend to disown those who tarnish the Democratic brand...Jesse Jackson Jr., John Edwards, William Jefferson, Herman Talamadge, Rod Blagojevich, Dan Rostenkowski, Chuck Chvala, and others who have tarnished the Democratic brand for adultery and/or corruption are regarded as persona non grata in the Democratic Party these days, or, in the case of Talamadge, would be persona non grata in the Democratic Party if he were alive today.
Republicans, with some exceptions, tend to admire those who tarnish their brand...Newt Gingrich, David Vitter, Spencer Bachus, and now Mark Sanford, just to name a few. As a matter of fact, Howie Klein of Down With Tyranny is reporting that Mark Foley is considering a redemption run for public office of his own, although I'm not sure if that's merely a joke by Klein or if Foley is actually considering a return to politics.
For another observation I've made from tonight's special election in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina, look below the orange squiggle.


Another observation that I've been able to make from the results in the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina is a key difference between how Democrats view the undue influence of money in politics and how Republicans view the undue influence of money in politics.
Democrats, for the most part, tend to support measures, up to and including efforts to amend the United States Constitution, to reduce the influence of money in American politics, particularly when it comes to the unlimited amounts of money that can be raised and spent by so-called ""SuperPACs"" as a result of the Citizens United vs. FEC Supreme Court case. While there are some Democrats who believe that Democratic front groups shouldn't raise unlimited amounts of money or not even run campaign ads at all, there are many Democrats, such as myself, who support changing the laws in order to reduce the influence of money in politics but are willing to allow Democratic outside groups to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on races until the rules are changed to prohibit that.
Republicans, for the most part, tend to embrace the concept of outside groups spending unlimited amounts of money unless, of course, it's used by Democrats against Republican candidates. Additionally, Republicans are unwilling to support measures to reduce the influence of money in American politics, but few Republicans are willing to openly admit that they support the concept of outside groups being able to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. The fact that Democratic front groups spent a large amount of money in an attempt to win the 1st Congressional District of South Carolina provoked a hostile reaction among Republican voters who were willing to either support Democratic candidate Elizabeth Colbert-Busch or not vote in protest of Sanford winning the Republican nomination but ultimately voted for Sanford.

Peter Schweizer’s book, Extortion: How Politicians Extract Your Money, Buy Votes and Line Their Own Pockets, exposes abusive money schemes undermining the legitimacy of representative government. Beltway tactics such as the “tollbooth,” the “milker bill,” and “double milker bills” shamelessly extort campaign cash to advance or stall legislation aimed at targeted money. All too often, the reality is “pay to delay” or “pay to play.”  
One scandalous revelation is the staggeringly high interest rate some politicians charge on personal loans they make to their own campaigns, resulting in windfall personal profit. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) pocketed $294,245 in interest payments on a $150,000 loan at 18% (later lowered to 10%). She dismissed 60 Minutes journalist Steve Kroft’s challenge to the “Mafia” interest rate, saying, “It’s not like I really profited… I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”  
Her comment opens a window into a dirty secret soiling mainstream party politics. Players get rich–typically with your money. At times, the sums are staggering.  
Jamie Gorelick served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton administration and followed that gig with a five-year tenure as a board member of the congressionally-chartered, tax-exempt Fannie Mae, where she reportedly received over $26 million in salary, bonuses, so-called performance pay, and stock options.  
Fellow Fannie Mae board member Franklyn Raines, who previously served as Bill Clinton’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, received $90,000,000 in total compensation for six years’ service. Yet Time Magazine called him one of the twenty-five people to blame for the 2008 financial meltdown. The New York Times reported that he agreed to pay $24.7 million, including a $2 million fine, to settle claims against him flowing from the crash.  
It is simply a “given” within the professional political class that insiders profit. A seemingly endless supply of tax dollars has long fueled complaints that government policy makers, office holders, functionaries, party insiders, connected lobbyists, and families cash in on the public dole. It even has a name: “crony capitalism.” The latest example is the debacle known as HealthCare.gov–hundreds of millions for what can at best be called an embarrassment developed by a Canadian subsidiary that contributed heavily to pols of all stripes.   
Rep. Napolitano’s dismissive backhand at the suggestion of anything remiss over her pocketing a mere $294k is symptomatic of the narcissism now epidemic in the political class. Real profit for the new elites is about serious largesse. Anything as paltry as her racket is chump change. It crosses party lines and flows from bloated government, obscure quasi-governmental entities, and politically packed special entities such as Fannie Mae. And it passes stealthily into respectful private business deals, where political rivals become strange bedfellows. 
The current gubernatorial race in Virginia offers a fascinating glimpse of one such pairing. Terry McAuliffe, a DC-area transplant from upstate New York, parlayed his political connections and fundraising acumen into the chairmanship of the DNC. His style of politics takes no prisoners.   
McAuliffe has a penchant for investing in techie upstarts with potential for big profit. In 1999, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Telergy, Inc., in Syracuse, New York, his home town. Telergy planned to create a contiguous end-to-end high-speed fiber optics network in the northeastern US along utility rights-of-way. Its plan was to leverage relationships with Niagara Mohawk, NYSEG, Consolidated  Edison, GPU, El Paso, and certain National Grid electric subsidiaries. A good old-fashioned dose of classic American initiative–with risks, to be sure–and the potential for handsome profit. 
And if the story stopped there, God bless every penny he and his partners could make. That’s why the Constitution protects private property as a fundamental right and encourages capital market creation by granting Congress legislative authority to introduce copyright and patent legislation, all of which encourages the risk/profit correlation that has driven the American economic engine to produce a better standard of living for the broadest swath of society the planet has ever known. 
However, the company vastly overvalued its assets and went bust. The Washington Free Beacon reported on McAuliffe’s Telergy link long ago. Byron York added some details here.
But there is more to the story. Telergy laid off a slew of local Syracuse employees–hundreds–without any severance in 2001 and, by the end of the year, filed for bankruptcy. McAuliffe has always said he was just an investor and did not run day-to-day operations. But Telegry’s S-1 SEC filing offers a tantalizing window into the relationships of political insiders and the subordination of principle to profit.  
The S-1 identifies McAuliffe under its list of “EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES.” See page 59. But notice who else it lists among the officers and directors:   
J. Patrick Barrett, President and Director. The former Chairman of the New York GOP State Committee during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, he is a wealthy and powerful party insider. No one moves within the upstate NY GOP without clearing things with Pat Barrett.  
 Thomas G. Young, Vice President, Government Relations. He was the Democrat Mayor of Syracuse from 1986-1993, which coincided with Pat Barrett’s term as GOP state party chair. A longtime political of Terry McAuliffe, who hails from Syracuse.  
John F. O’Mara, Director. He served as special counsel to George Pataki when the latter was governor of NY and was chair of the New York State Public Service Commission. A powerful state GOP insider. 
And, of course, McAuliffe.  
All were key players in the political rough and tumble of NY party politics. Some still are. And they were adversaries. Ideologically and politically split–or so it would appear. Yet here they were, in bed together in their personal business investments–and not as mere passive investors the way millions are when vested in mutual funds or as capital investors in start-ups. Each took publicly-identified roles as significant players with fiduciary responsibilities. 
But even when the deals go bust, the directors and key people make out, as happened with Telergy. McAuliffe reportedly made some $1.2 million by brokering an investment in Telergy by Gary Winnick of Global Crossing, another company McAuliffe invested in and made millions before it, too, went bankrupt. That failure resulted in $54 billion in shareholder losses and 10,000 lost jobs. 
There is nothing wrong with making lots of money. We all love the idea. But the deeper point is to recognize what the money can do to the insiders. Telergy was but one example. 
Is it reasonable to believe that such relationships do not erode independence? How aggressively will a state party chair campaign against the local mayor of a rival party come election season when the two are officers of the same business venture? And what of their advocacy of the cherished goals of the grass roots party faithful?It isn’t crony capitalism, but it reeks of cynicism. And its effect on sincerity and message is corrosive. 
It is one reason some believe the RINO element within the GOP is uncomfortable with Ken Cuccinelli. Like Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Scott Walker, these insurgent new bloods really believe in freedom, the ideals of their agenda, the sanctity of life, and the restoration of principal. And a new core of GOP leaders stands ready to seize the party with them: Gov. Nikki Haley, Congresswomen Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Kristi Noem, Senators Tom Coburn, Deb Fisher, Pat Toomey, and more.
The emerging voices of conservative principle are sounding the heat of the nation. For a long time, too many have allowed deception to pile high the precipice from which we fall until so dark and damp a tomb we become accustomed to the stench of rotted expectation. No more. With a nod to Mr. Dylan, “the times they are a-changing.”  "

She nailed it from the extremism to the petty bullying that has infested our State Legislature since the Red Tide election of 2010.
After taking even more extremist anti-abortion legislation off the table as I diaried here, saying they were going to end the legislative session on a lighter note, Republicans in the State Assembly pulled out a brand new shiny Voter Suppression Bill and resurrected a bill to allow state-issued anti-abortion license plates.
They did this because they got into a snit about Assembly Democrats calling for a vote on an already approved bill to honor the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre which passed the State Senate unanimously.  Republicans in the Assembly refused to even consider that bill.  Why?  Nobody seems to know.  So, in retaliation, they brought out more extremist bills including a brand new one to further restrict voting in Wisconsin.  Yes, it's gotten that petty.


The most severe of the voter suppression measures Republicans passed in 2011, including the presentation of a state-issued ID, are on hold by the courts.  Left in place, however, are measures that restrict early voting and absentee ballots,  as well as a requirement that all voters must sign the poll book.  These measures increase the amount voters who must vote in person as well as increase the actual amount of time poll workers need to spend with each voter.  Of course, this increases the lines of people who vote, further discouraging those with busy schedules or in crowded voting precincts.  And that's the intent of those laws - to suppress the vote in Democratic areas.
That wasn't enough for Republicans, though.  Their brand new shiny voter suppression bill removes ALL weekend voting (their limitation to 1 weekend from 3 in 2011 wasn't restrictive enough to prevent electoral wins by Tammy Baldwin and Barack Obama in 2012) and restricts early voting to ONE WEEK and ONLY during the hours of 7:30 AM - 5 PM (that'll show those folks who try to vote before or after work).
Not only that, but anyone without that ID needs to sign an affidavit that they're indigent and their ""vote"" is not guaranteed to be counted.  A person who doesn't have the time to go during work hours to get that ID, has no transportation to a DMV for that ID, or who can't obtain the documents necessary for the ID will have to declare their indigent and possibly get their vote tossed if they aren't.
So, here we go again.
On top of all of this, they want to make the Chief Justice position based on the election of the fellow justices (currently it's the most senior Justice and has been done that way for more than 100 years).  Naturally, they want to impose the will of the RW 4 of 7 justices who have bought their seats instead of having moderate Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson as the Chief based on her long history of service on the State Supreme Court.
And they've also succeeded in changing the reasons for recall to the reasons Scott Walker cited during his own recall.   There has been no reason necessary other than the will of the voters.  Now the recalled official must be charged and/or convicted of a felony or ethics violation.  This would make it impossible for Walker to have politically profited from the voter anger that made him Milwaukee County Executive had it been in effect 15 years ago.  It would also make it impossible for us to recall anyone for malfeasance in office or anything outside of criminal behavior.
I think we be ""safe"" from them for the next year.  They're done with their extremism until after the next election because they can't count on the poor memories of Wisconsinites or the power of their massive money to ensure their re-election.
They know no bottom and know no shame.

135,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/12/ethics-emails-epa,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,EPA Email Scandal Fits Pattern of Its Secrecy,"
As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to lead the most open, most transparent administration in history. He has not kept that promise. Time and again, members of his administration have failed to keep faith with the American people. Acting in secret, they have taken sometimes extraordinary steps to shield their actions from the public.
The latest example involved Lisa Jackson, who has led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since the beginning of the president’s first term. Jackson is resigning, but only after it was revealed she used a fake name (Richard Windsor) to create a fake e-mail address to conduct official EPA business.
What Jackson did contravenes federal law which, because as a nation we value open and transparent government, prohibits such behavior.
This is not the first time the EPA has been in the spotlight because its administrator acted against the interests of transparency. Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton and then served for a time as President Obama’s “environmental czar” – ordered the hard drive on her government computer erased and reformatted and all backup tapes destroyed only hours after a federal judge had ordered the EPA to preserve all agency e-mail records.
This conduct, the use of phony e-mail addresses and the erasure of computers pose an interesting question: What is the EPA and its administrators doing that they are so unwilling to have their official communications become public? It doesn’t paint a pretty picture for the left’s agenda or its methods of implementation.
Jackson’s conduct came to light only after a a whistle-blower divulged she was using her fake e-mail account to conduct controversial business, evade congressional oversight, and get around the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act. Typically, government business is conducted in public. Correspondence and e-mail must be available to scrutiny, both by Congress and the American people. When a fake name is used, it allows an agency and its employees to evade accountability.
There is no way around it. This is government corruption at its highest form – and the polar opposite of the kind of transparent and open government political leaders on both sides of the aisle claim to want.
EPA’s record of following the law and being transparent couldn’t be much worse. Obama’s EPA has twice failed to provide as required by law a “Unified Agenda” which is a compendium of regulations planned in the foreseeable future. For the record, no other administration has ever even once failed to meet the requirements of this law. This, combined with the more than 12,000 secret e-mails, suggests a pattern of chicanery, obfuscation, and lawlessness at Obama’s EPA.
The problem does not end with Ms. Jackson or her staff. For the last four years, when asked to respond to lawful requests for information by Congress or by American citizens under FOIA, EPA attorneys did not provide e-mail sent and received by the administrator at her “Richard Windsor” e-mail address. Moreover, they affirmed that all responsive e-mails had been provided, when they clearly had not.
It is important whether these attorneys knew or had reason to know that their representations were false. And it is incumbent on the U.S. Congress and, perhaps, the U.S. Department of Justice to begin an inquiry into whether they did so.
To stop the culture of corruption at the EPA, it is not sufficient for Ms. Jackson to step down. There must be a comprehensive investigation concerning the actions of Ms. Jackson, her staff, and EPA attorneys who were involved. It must be determined who knew about or participated in the corruption. Ms. Jackson clearly did but did anyone else? Any government employee involved should be fired and prosecuted. If they are an attorney, they should also be disbarred.
No one has ever gone to jail for violating the Freedom of Information Act but, the federal mail and wire fraud law is broadly used to target corruption in government that falls well short of bribery or extortion. Ms. Jackson and all those who participated in the fraudulent and fake e-mail scheme should face prosecution.
Once the 12,000 or more secret e-mails become public, Attorneys General and United States Attorneys all over the United States will likely have jurisdiction to investigate and perhaps even prosecute Ms. Jackson or anyone else who were involved in there e-mail fraud scheme. Congress should also have a full investigation and also determine if other of agencies have engaged in similarly corrupt schemes designed to shield their activities from public scrutiny, particularly those that pertain to the official function of their position and the development of public policy.
The Obama administration has been one of the least transparent or open administrations in memory. The activities of Lisa Jackson at the EPA are just one example of that. If the president hopes to remove the taint from his administration, he must take a personal interest in rooting out this sort of corruption. He cannot simply accept Ms. Jackson’s resignation and call the matter closed.
George Landrith is president of Frontiers of Freedom, a Virginia-based public policy organization. Peter Roff is a senior fellow at FOF."

The headline reads, “McAuliffe avoids position on EPA rules, Cuccinelli dodges on House spending vote,” because just like Virginia’s Democrat gubernatorial nominee, Terry McAuliffe, the left-wing Washington Post wants to have it both ways. In an article published Friday, the Post tries to mitigate the damage President Obama’s new strict carbon emission limits will have on the McAuliffe campaign by also putting a pox on Republican nominee Cuccinelli’s house over, bizarrely, DC’s ongoing budget battles. 
But as hard as the Post might try, there is just no comparing the latest round of federal budget battles to the effect Obama’s war on coal will have on Virginia and working class Virginians.
At the bottom of its article, the Post is eventually forced to admit that the Cuccinnelli campaign — if not the man himself — actually did comment on the possibility of a government shutdown:
“It’s pretty rich that in the same week it was revealed that Terry McAuliffe wants to shut down Virginia’s government, he’s now focused on whether the federal government is going to do the same,” Cullen said, referring to remarks by McAuliffe that he would not sign a budget as governor if it did not include funds for expanding Medicaid. “No one wants to see the federal government shut down, period. Ken Cuccinelli is not running for Congress, he’s running for governor. . . . Ken Cuccinelli would more than welcome a debate with Terry McAuliffe on the issue of Obamacare.”
Fast Terry, however, has yet to stand up for the state’s southwest coal country, and who knows how many middle class jobs. Instead of staking a position one way or another, the McAuliffe campaign punted with a statement that tries to please everyone and promises to take a position sometime in the future:
Terry agrees with the broad swath of scientists, economists, and military leaders, who view climate change as a looming problem for Virginia,” campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote in an e-mail. “While he agrees that there needs to be some limit on carbon pollution and believes that Virginia can and should lead the way in building new plants that create low-cost, low-carbon energy, he looks forward to further reviewing the President’s proposed rules in detail and studying their impact on Virginia’s economy.”
Cuccinnelli was quick to jump on the Obama administration:
“The administration renewed its war on coal today,” Cuccinelli said, adding — as he often does — that “a war on coal is a war on the poor” and that Virginia “needs a governor who’ll fight for those folks” who depend on the coal industry.
It is doubtful Virginia voters will care one or another if a potential governor chooses to focus on his state as opposed to the latest drama unfurling in the nation’s capitol. These new carbon emission controls, however, directly affect the state and thousands of Virginia jobs. 
Instead of choosing a position, McAuliffe is likely hoping to dither through the last five weeks left in the campaign. And as we have already seen, the Washington Post will be right there to hold his hand.

Perversion is dangerous
Mr. moulitsas you are a first-rank promotor of homosexuality and other deviant behivior. I think this is because you do not undrsetand the danger of such pervert activity.
Male homosexusality is the cause of AIDS and drug use.It has also been proven that most pedophiles are male homosexuals. this measn that completely outlawing male homsoexaulity would gretly reduce crime or even completely eliminate it. Violence isalso mostly caused by male homosexuals, note that Hitler was an homosexual.
Female homosexauls are a different matter baecause they are not violent or cirminal, or use drugs like male homosecuals. They are more dangerous thou because they reduce the number of avaialable women. And less women means that less children be born every year. And when no kids are born this country will become mexico (yes, the one with the drug cartells). Outlawing female hoosexuality is necesary to keep our country alive.
As you cans ee I am not saying we that anyone should be executed just that that homosexuality should be illegal. This is reasonable and also constitutioinal since the constitution was writen by non-homosexuals. You should support thi agenda to protect children and our country.

Poor Eva Braun! Unless ... she was a hoosexual too!

Tax-trough feeders

Tax-trough feeders like school teachers (who produce nothing -- the kids are all illiterate) now outnumber the tax contributors so there's no way the country will work.
Too many takers and not enough givers can only go downhill and you can see it happening.
In California corporations leave and take their tax-payers with them.
California is finished and the teacher's unions are largely to blame

I've long noticed this right-wing fantasy California, where the state is crumbling and jobs are leaving and whatnot. I wrote about it here. I decided to engage.
From: Markos

Name three California corporations that have left.
Heck, name one.

From: Dewayne Knox
To: Markos
I'm not helping someone like you with research -- I personally have persuaded three California corporations to leave and they for obvious reasons shall remain nameless.
Even many corporations not registered in Calif have taken most if not all their function out of state which essentially means the tax (paid by their workers) with them as well -- Verizon, half the entertainment industry find it to costly to work. There are many that have just outsourced and you know it  A friend of mine who is a simple insurance agent moved to Vegas and with all the fees and compliances now removed even he saves about 20K a year.
If it's not a problem why the shortfall and lay-offs -- despite the tax increases. I enjoy watching the state workers and teachers squirm -- they brought it on themselves. I'm retired but it's great to watch the lay-off show.  California's gone from the Golden State of Ronald Reagan to the banana republic of Jerry Brown.
I have a story of California stupidity so ludicrous it should be on 60 minutes but it's too long to waste time here. Enjoy the cuts prick.

Ahh, so you don't know any major corporations. Just making shit up. Typical.

From: Dewayne Knox
To: Markos
I never said major -- stop making shit up.
California is being eroded from underneath -- no great announcements just small companies that are no longer here -- doesn't mean they're not somewhere else -- hellooooo.
I see you won't answer my question. If it's not happening why is there a budget deficit?
California has great agriculture, great ports, cheap labor, defense industry (what hasn't left), entertainment (what hasn't left) Silicon Valley (for now) sales tax, state tax (some states have neither -- but no budget deficit) and taxes on everything -- yet there's deficits.
Forty years of big spending democrats and parasitic unions have ruined the place -- and now with sponging state retirees expecting fat pensions there is no fix. I'm not a repub but at least they put some brakes on the spending but they never get the chance here and this the result -- aided and abetted by greaseballs like you. Pity those Turks didn't wipe you out -- but you seem to be doing it to yourselves over there.

From: Markos
To: Dewayne Knox
So no major corporation has left California, it still has more Fortune 500 companies than any other state, and far more diversified economy at that. It has a balanced budget (actually a surplus, link below) -- something the last Republican governor couldn't accomplish, and it's still the center of both the global entertainment and technology industries.
So your evidence that corporations are leaving California is your podunk insurance agent friend? Somehow, I think California will manage to survive that devastating blow, lol.
http://www.reuters.com/...
You know what allowed us to build budget surplus? A Democratic governor and Democratic super-majorities in the state legislature. No more rump fringe Republicans able to hold California back.
And best of all? America is following suite. Pretty awesome, huh?

From: Dewayne Knox
To: Markos
Hey Turkey's bitch,
Some co's are still registered here but they've removed their facilities so the tax payers have gone. I suppose all the layoffs are just my imagination and those still with a job are living on eggshells. Teachers with forty kids in the class instead of twenty as teaching staff gets reduced. I see the numbers -- oh and I don't bother with links -- you can get viruses you know.
I haven't gone into a lot of detail because some companies are working the angles and I'm not tipping you off. It's easy to get out of Calif tax if you know how and all the lame propositions can't stop the loss.
Governors have little to do with it idiot -- the dem house does the spending -- dems if left to themselves will bankrupt anything -- and you ain't seen nothing yet.
How's your greaseball Greek economy doing Lol

From: Markos
To: Dewayne Knox
You can get a virus from Reuters? Ha ha ha! But I get it. Fox News or bust, right?
But then again, you think California has a budget deficit when it has a surplus, so reality isn't your strong suit. Neither is providing evidence for your Fox-fueled fantasies.

From: Dewayne Knox
To: Markos
The list of business leaving Calif has no end in sight -- you're probably a tax-trough feeder but your views shoot yourself in the foot -- that trough you're feeding from is on shaky grounds.  Go and gloat about your surplus with those laid off -- not that I give a fuck for them either -- I've fed off state employees for years and now I'm showing companies how to leave this liberal mess.  Google on opening a corporation in Nevada and other places -- all those law firms don't advertise for nothing -- they make a profit year in year out because so many take that step. It's great. But put your Visigoth head in the sand -- ignore the inevitable .
And fuck Fox news -- the media is all the same
Go Turkey -- fuck those Visigoths hee hee

From: Markos
To: Dewayne Knox
So no actual examples, just some random insurance agent? So I looked it up. 254 businesses left California in 2011. That same year, 132,000 new businesses were started in the state -- by far the most of any state in the country, and second-most per capita (only Arizona had more startups, per capita).
Reality is a bitch, huh? Like when you thought California had a budget deficit, but thanks to Democratic super-majorities it now has a nearly $1 billion surplus?

From: Dewayne Knox
To: Markos
Ha ha I got Nick the Greek rattled.
132,000 hahaha  -- 3 still in business -- and they're wetbacks mowing lawns
No point in telling you -- you don't (or don't dare) read it.  You prefer fiction
I gave you a short list -- you can google a thousand for yourself. Companies might have an address here -- I do myself -- but the facility is elsewhere. But to you I'm a positive statistic hee hee
You haven't explained why they're laying off people in your prosperous Golden state -- teachers by the thousand -- God knows what the private sector's like -- almost non-existent.
Anyway I enjoy watching the 20% unemployment in inaction -- serves the fuckers right. I'd love to have you face to face with them -- they'd probably kill ya -- you know -- those who are no longer entitled to unemployment so for myth pushers like you they don't exist.
Keep crunching your figures -- all professional bulshitters do
Go Turkey -- kill those useless Ostrogoths

From: Markos
To: Dewayne Knox
Let me guess -- you're one of those people who ""unskewed"" polls late last year, because only the ""professional bulshitters"" (your spelling) believed the (poll) figures, right?
You'd think you wingers would learn their lessons and start trusting reality. And you know what is reality? California led the nation in job creation the last 12 months:
http://www.cbsnews.com/...
California has created almost 234,000 jobs, more than Texas and the next nine biggest states combined.
Sucks when reality smacks hard against your ideology, huh?

And that was that. I never did figure out what he had against the Ostrogoths.

This is what I look like. The result of an ancestry of a bicentennial of breeding farms and rape during the enslavement period on one side of the family, and a loving marriage between a white Kansan grandmother and a black grandfather from Tennessee on the other (whose marriage was illegal in many parts of the U.S. in 1915 when they wed).
Since we've been informed by Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen that the sight of ""us"" (and we number in the millions) makes racists he refuses to call racists gag—I suggest strongly that they complete the process.
Puke on.
I've read outraged responses to his column, from Ta-Nehisi Coates, to Hunter here at Daily Kos, to Salon and more, but still haven't been able to shake off my own anger at Cohen (and his WaPo bosses) whose inability to state that gaggers=teabaggers=racists, displays once again his Paleolithic punditry and history of racism, sexism and homophobia.
What was also bizarre was while using the de Blasio family as an example of what evokes choking (de Blasio who just won by a landslide in NYC), he singles out Harry Belafonte, as if every major civil rights organization hasn't called out the Teapublican brand of hate, and as if Republicans across the board haven't been supporting racist voter repression, anti-immigration reform, and programs like Stop and Frisk.  
Hey Cohen—if it looks like a racist, talks like a racist, passes racist legislation, it ain't conventional at all—it's racist.  
Recent surveys prove that a vast majority of Americans approve of interracial marriage. Yet his ""not-racists"" (his holders of conventional views) to whom he attributes a gag reflex still exist, as an antediluvian minority, like the 46 percent of Republicans surveyed in Mississippi who would like to ban it. They are not reflective of national opinion.
I look at myself each morning in the mirror. A black woman, clearly with ancestry not exclusively sub-Saharan African. Such is the nature of the ""made in the U.S.A."" label for so many of us ""black"" folks, and others who reflect a mélange of cross-ethnic marriages and lineages.  
From my point of view anyone who objects to me and mine as some sort of abomination, deserves an 100 percent made by the KKK tag, with hooded accessories.
Follow me below the fold for more.


Our mixed ancestral genesis, and demographics here on these shores, in the Caribbean, Latin America, and even in Europe, or in Africa itself (for example ""Cape Coloureds"" in South Africa) exhibits no inability on the part of ""whites"" to mingle sperm and ova with ""blacks"" or any other form of cross-ethnic fertilization and birth. We are homo sapiens sapiens, not different species. But it took until 1967 for the Supreme Court here in the U.S. to validate the right to marry across racial lines as the law of the land. The irony of Loving v. Virginia, which ended legal discrimination is in the surname ""Loving.""
I'm fed up with the denial about, and excuses made for Teapublican Christians who talk about Jesus's love on a Sunday morning out of one side of their mouth and excoriate ""race mixing"" out of the other. The path to the pews should carpeted in the vile retching of hypocrites.
Chief Justice Earl Warren ruled:
Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival. [...] To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State ...
There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.

Many couples across the U.S. now celebrate ""Loving Day.""
I know the history of so-called race mixing in the U.S. quite well. It has been standard practice since the pilgrims and colonists arrived on these shores with penises wielded as weapons of rape and ethnocide against Native Americans. Children were often born from these violent encounters. The rape statistics for Native American women do not abate, and those rapes are perpetrated mostly by white men.
What should be making us all puke is the continued abuse of women.  

Hoax pamphlet whose author coined the tern ""miscegenation""

From the genesis of the hoax perpetrated by two news reporters which spawned the term ""miscegenation"" to the theories of the sterility and depravity of human ""mules"" or mulattoes, to the ideology of white supremacy that unleashed a reign of racial terror typecasting black men as rapists hell-bent on defiling the flowers of white womanhood, to the histories of many free people of color in southern climes due to sexual congress and often love between black men and mainly Irish indentured servant women, to the elite founders, like Thomas Jefferson who sired children with his white wife's half-sister Sally Hemings—race mixing has been as American as apple pie.
Black women were portrayed as demon temptresses exuding savage sexual heat, always available for white men's courser needs, when they were not cast as mammies providing a teat to nurse white babies. Some were ""privileged"" to be raised to be sold-off as concubines in elaborate quadroon balls of the plaçage system. Others were bred ""light"" or ""bright"" for the fancy trade and sold to bordellos.
As long as ""union"" was illicit, it proliferated. Yet it is the placing of a legal stamp of matrimony on this intercourse that so offended the sensibilities of the pious. Their bigotry has been bolstered by a long history of racialist pseudo science.  
As genetic science has progressed in recent years, we accumulate more data on the geographical ancestry of those of us called ""African-Americans"" or blacks.  
The popular PBS miniseries African-American Lives featured this data.
With the help of geneticists, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. put African-American ancestry in these terms:
• 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one great-grandparent);
• 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one grandparent);
• 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50 percent European ancestry (equivalent of one parent); and
• 5 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5 percent Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent).
Critics suggested the program did not fully acknowledge or inform guests (and the audience) that not all ancestry may show up in the tests. The genetic tests done on direct paternal or maternal line evaluate only a few ancestors among many. Ancestral information markers (AIM) must also be done to form a more complete picture of a person's ancestry. For instance, MtDNA testing is only of direct maternal ancestors. Unless other ancestry is evaluated, a person may miss a paternal line's connection to Europe. This gives a false impression that the person has little heritage of another ethnic group. AIM markers are not as clearly defined for all populations as suggested, and depend on data still being accumulated. Historic populations migrated, which also influences results. Particularly, critics note that genetic analysis is incomplete related to Native Americans, and new genetic markers for these populations may be identified.

We know that racialist pseudo science is not buried in the past. The internet has a sewer-full of sites that tout opposition to ""race-mixing"" and intermarriage. The comment sections of websites from Faux News, redstate, freerepublic, and even mainstream news agencies are chock-full of upchuck linking to, or quoting so-called ""authorities.""  
Like this one: ""The health consequences of race mixing"" which has links to ""studies"" and throws in anecdotal observations, and ""data"":
It is commonly observed that a disproportionate number of white women who end up with black men are obese. Obese women tend to have elevated testosterone levels. Some portion of testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which amplifies the effect of testosterone at certain targets. DHT is also one of the culprits in the genesis of acne. Therefore, a higher incidence of, say, acne in black/white-mixed offspring with a white mother could simply reflect inheritance of the genetics of elevated androgens from the obese white mother rather than an effect of race mixing.
 
Pure claptrap and bigot babble.
When a Richard Cohen, or any other public pundit asserts ""today's GOP is not racist"" I admit I'm pleased to see the swift and immediate pushback. More important will be how GOP racism will translate into ballots cast against them in upcoming 2014 elections around the nation. They seem to be in denial that in spite of gagging bigots, we elected a black man of mixed ancestry to two terms in the White House.  
Here's hoping we can retire quite a few more gagger-baggers from statehouses and the Congress.
Let them go home and vomit to their hearts content as private citizens, and while gagging invite Richard Cohen over to share a conventional meal.

I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
“How do you make abortion funny?” That was a key question mulled at a major conservative gathering Friday on how to make social conservatism appealing to young people, after an election where Republicans got trounced in the battle for millennial voters (who are are moving even further and further away from the Christian-right on marriage on other issues).
Abortion has to be made funny, the thinking goes, because funny sells on social media, and that’s where one goes to court young people. “You can engage with sarcasm, it’s hard with the abortion issue, but you have to,” said Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins at a breakout panel at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Conference in Washington today on how to win millennial voters. “Unfortunately we have to, because this is the generation that we’ve been dealt.”

So the way to convince young Americans to join the Republican Party is to make abortion hilarious. Or at least be sarcastic about it. Your abortion-related humor will then get the young folks these days to realize that you are hip and with it and that they really want on board with that whole Gilead-patterened premise of social conservative religious rule, aka Jesus Sharia.
You know something? Screw it. You go for it, folks. I would have paid solid pay-per-view prices to see Mitt Romney standing at the Republican National Convention plastering the audience with some truly top-notch abortion jokes. How many abortions does it take to change a light bulb? A priest, a rabbi and an abortion walk into a bar, and the priest says hey pal, you're an abomination, I can't believe they let you in here. You know, humor.
The premise apparently extends to being anti-gay-marriage as well; nothing attracts the young folks like treating gay people like dirt while also making jokes about it on Twitter. Unfortunately, those ""young people"" are about 12 years old, so they'll have to figure out a way to keep them occupied until voting age. Maybe some fetus-related puppet shows or something.
In the meantime, I think we all need to start preparing an escape plan. The moon is far too boring, and Mars might take a long, long time to terraform, but we've got to at least start considering our options. We're nearing maximum crackpot. This thing's about to go supernova.

Ya got your work cut out for you, Reince



Ya got your work cut out for you, Reince

The big problem Republicans face in trying to rebrand their party as more tolerant and inclusive is, of course, all the damn Republicans:
A Michigan member of the Republican National Committee said Thursday he will not resign after posting an article critical of gay people on his Facebook page, despite calls from members of his own party that he step down.
Dave Agema, who served as a state representative from 2007 until December posted an excerpt from an article titled ""Everyone Should Know These Statistics On Homosexuals"" on his Facebook page Wednesday. A group of 21 Michigan Republicans, including local precinct delegates and members of the University of Michigan College Republicans, has called it ""deplorable.""

The so-called article was in fact just a particularly vile and hateful screed, claiming things like ""part of the homosexual agenda is to get the public to affirm their filthy lifestyle,"" that gay Americans are obsessed with ""recruiting children"" and so forth. This also is a good representation of how the party base operates, which is to base all of their deep policy decisions on ""obviously insane stuff they read on Facebook."" Anyway, the Michigan party chair and Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus both had to come out with new statements about treating people with dignity and respect and so on, though I'm almost positive they just have a form letter for that by now.
How many of these stories have we had, just in the last few days? Priebus brags about a new effort to spend $10 million for outreach in minority communities, a number which probably is going to need to be doubled after Don Young's foul ""wetbacks"" comments on Thursday. He might get more bang for the buck if he spends that kind of money on Shutting Your Damn Trap lessons for all current members of the Republican hierarchy. Or not; it's not clear it's a lesson any of them could learn, no matter how much effort you put into it.

Rep. Michele Bachmann's former chief of staff will tell an Iowa Senate ethics panel that the congresswoman made improper payments to the state chairman of her presidential campaign, the Minneapolis Star Tribune's Kevin Diaz reports  ... SNIP ...
The investigation in Iowa is one of at least three ongoing investigations into the congresswoman's presidential campaign. There is also a Federal Election Commission probe and one from the Office of Congressional Ethics. Authorities also reportedly opened a criminal investigation into the alleged theft of a email list by Sorenson from a campaign volunteer. As Diaz notes, the investigations are part of a growing web of legal problems facing Bachmann.
Salon
When your former chief of staff provides an affidavit that you made improper payments it is a little hard to claim that there's no fire beneath all that smoke.
More below the Orange Squiggle of Power.


From the Minnesota Star Trib:
Gilmore said Parrish can provide the ethics panel documentary evidence that Sorenson was paid $7,500 a month to work on Bachmann's campaign, money that was funneled to him indirectly through C&M Strategies, a Colorado-based company controlled by Bachmann fundraiser Guy Short.
Parrish is the former CoS. Gilmore is his lawyer. The money came from Bachmann's independent PAC, which makes it almost impossible for her to claim innocence - not that reality and logic have much to do with her speech.
Parrish's willingness to go public against his former employer and political mentor is likely to send shock waves through Minnesota GOP circles, where both he and his attorney are well-known figures.
Parrish served as deputy campaign manager of last year's unsuccessful effort to pass a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Gilmore is a well-known conservative blogger.

The Minnesota GOP has some problems, oh yes they do. And that's what happens when one of the leading figures in the state party is a lunatic grifter ... come to think of it, that really doesn't narrow it down to Minnesota.
Michele has other problems than making illegal payments to Mr. Sorenson. Sorenson allegedly stole a proprietary mailing list from a volunteer's computer, and the police are investigating that. Congressional investigators are looking into her conflating her book tour and her Presidential campaign - good thing Newt Gingrich is no longer in Congress.
It will be a sad day for Kossacks when Michele Bachmann retires from Congress. Who will take her place as the March to Madness champion of the GOP? Only time will tell! There are certainly no shortage of candidates in the party for which facts are optional.
And somehow, this reminds me of Ms. Bachmann's modus operandi.

When the media can aid Obama’s re-election through the fabrication of a divisive and completely phony black vs. white racial narrative, then the media are very interested in hate crimes and American racism. But when the media are handed an actual hate crime that involves a black man accused of gunning down four white people because they are white, the media collectively shrug.
The media also claim to be interested in mass-shootings. For days and sometimes weeks, we have seen our media turn their outlets over to obsessive coverage of one mass shooting after another. So you would think a racially-motivated mass-shooting would explode in the media. 
But according to our media, not all racially-motivated crimes and mass shootings are alike. In fact, if the media see no political upside, some racially-motivated mass-shootings are ignored as though they never even happened.  
In Greenville, North Carolina, it is now official. According to the Grand Jury indictments, a black man named Lakim Faust entered a Walmart in June with more than a hundred rounds of ammunition, and targeted white people based on their race:
Police said Faust’s first victim on June 21 was an insurance adjustor in the parking lot of a law firm. He then crossed a five-lane highway and shot three more people in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, investigators said.
Three of the four people wounded in the shooting suffered permanent and debilitating injuries, according to the indictments. Details of those injuries were not specified.
In a just world, a local crime such as this would not deserve national coverage. One man does not in any way say anything larger about our society as a whole. But I do not write the rules, the media does; and the media poses as an objective institution concerned with hate crimes — so concerned, in fact, that they went so far as to manufacture evidence as a way to falsely accuse the Hispanic George Zimmerman of being both white and a racist. 
But an actual, official hate crime in North Carolina is completely ignored by this very same media. 
The reason is obvious: the objective, unbiased, not-at-all-liberal media see no political upside in a hate crime that can’t be used to gin up the left’s version of white guilt, push gun control, or falsely portray America as a country where white people still oppress minorities and therefore need a larger government to right these wrongs. 
The media ignoring this racially-motivated murder spree also has nothing to do with protecting black people. 
Sadly, the media don’t care about black people. This is why Chicago is ignored. Hundreds of black people are gunned down every year in Chicago. But the national media refuse to pressure the politicians in charge of that city and state to do anything, because on paper Chicago is a Liberal Utopia. The city also enforces some of the strongest gun control laws in the country.
If the media questions what is happening in Chicago, that would be mean questioning the very foundation of liberalism. And the media simply doesn’t believe a few hundred dead black people is worth doing anything that might undermine their political agenda.

The mainstream media have awoken to the fact that President Barack Obama’s partisan attack on Republicans during the Navy Yard attack on Monday may not have been the best idea, even if only for tactical reasons. 
The New York Times‘ Maureen Dowd worried that Obama’s speech meant that he “cannot seem to connect anymore” and concluded that the president had been “overtaken by events.” The Hill called it a political “blunder” and agreed, via a quote from a “former aide,” that he had been “overtaken by events.” (Poor President Obama, always the victim of circumstances not of his own making, always “overtaken by events”!)
While it is encouraging that the media have noticed Obama’s attack–even though most networks cut away after he briefly mentioned the Navy Yard shooting–they continue to ignore three glaring problems:
1. The fact that Obama never considered canceling or postponing the speech. A president who does not realize that a mass shooting on a military base in the nation’s capital city is a reason to suspend politics as usual is dangerously removed from his duties as commander-in-chief–never mind the political damage. In addition, he is receiving bad advice, ignoring good advice, or simply not being advised by staff who have learned that he tunes out all but a select group of trusted Chicago insiders and loyalists. By putting politics first, the Obama administration is putting the nation at risk–at a time when risks are only growing.
2. The fact that the media pilloried Mitt Romney for lesser sins in 2012. When Mitt Romney issued a statement criticizing the Obama administration’s apologetic response to the Cairo embassy attack on Sep. 11 last year, the media attacked him viciously. Romney, too, was “overtaken by events”: he did not know that four Americans would be killed in Benghazi. But the media never let Romney forget his alleged gaffe, while giving Obama a pass for his inaction that night. Because the media never hold Obama accountable for anything, he rarely takes his governing responsibilities seriously, exacerbating a dangerous vacuum in national leadership.
3. The fact that the Navy Yard attack happened at all, four years after Ft. Hood. It is easier for the Obama-supporting media to dwell on an inappropriate speech than to ask the much more important question: how did the attack happen at all? Four years after a similar mass shooting at Fort Hood, was nothing done to improve security at military bases? Why were rules restricting guns on base not changed?  Did the Obama administration let the nation’s guard down by downplaying Ft. Hood as “workplace violence” instead of terrorism? Why, after the NSA scandal, was there no review of security clearance procedures and lists?"

Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, April 25, 2013



Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism, April 25, 2013

Pew:
In the four months since the Newtown, Connecticut shootings, the tone of the conversation about gun control on Twitter has shifted sharply several times in apparent response to ongoing events, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of nearly 21 million tweets from December 18 through April 21.
NY Times talks immigration reform prospects, but could be talking about gun laws or anything else:
“I think the opposition is counting on mistrust of government, hatred of Obama and the idea that Congress can’t get anything right to combine as the pathway to no,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group.
Interest waning? No. Mediaite:
Politicians counting on Americans to forget about Newtown when they go to the ballot box next year may be in for a surprise. A pair of recent PPP polls shows that “no” votes from Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Jeff Flake(R-AZ, NRA rating=A), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK, NRA rating=A), Mark Begich (D-AK, NRA rating=D),Rob Portman (R-OH, NRA rating=A), and Dean Heller (R-NV, NRA rating=A) have dropped them into varying degrees of hot water with voters. Another poll from Pew showed that, while overall dissatisfaction with the vote did not match the 90% approval of background checks, many more Americans were disappointed or angry about the Senate’s failure to pass background checks than those who were relieved or happy.
A pair of new polls shows that even in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, the public’s interest in the gun control debate has actually increased, and the number of Americans who identify guns as the most important problem facing this country is equal to the number who answer “terrorism” to the same question.

Gun safety advocates are not going away. Intensity is not on the side of gun rights. It does not hurt politiclans to vote for background checks. 5 y.o.s should not have guns, even in Kentucky. And what other myths do you want addressed?
How about the deep paranoia of Republicans that the media who tut-tut Obama's record are afraid to tell you about?
Poll: 29% Think Armed Rebellion Might Soon Be Necessary
The eye-opening findings serve as a reminder that Americans’ deeply held beliefs about gun rights have a tendency to cross over into outright conspiracy theories about a nefarious government seeking to trample the Second Amendment — paranoia that pro-gun groups like the National Rifle Association have at times helped stoke. The data help explain why even the most modest gun safety laws face tremendous, intense opposition.

NY Times:
“I’m for stricter gun laws, but the reason I favor the Republicans over the Democrats and the liberals on gun laws is because they have always been against the Second Amendment and the right to own guns,” said Jim Hensley, 69, a Republican from Grandville, Mich., in an interview after the poll was conducted.
“Yes, I believe the Republicans should have voted for background checks, and they should not legalize automatic weapons,” Mr. Hensley added. “I was against the repeal of the ban on automatic weapons, and I don’t support the N.R.A. But it’s like marriage. You stick with your wife no matter what, and you don’t just ditch your political party on one issue.”

Voting is tribal, not logical. Sometimes you simply need to win rather than worry about convincing everyone of the whys and wherefores.
Two weeks after a bipartisan measure that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers was defeated in the Senate, nearly 9 in 10 of those surveyed said they favored background checks on all gun buyers, and 6 in 10 said they were disappointed or angry with the vote.
Want intensity? You're looking at it.



Tragic. LA Times:
A 2-year-old Kentucky girl was accidentally killed by her 5-year-old brother who fired a rifle he had been given as a gift, officials said Wednesday.
Cumberland County Coroner Gary L. White said an autopsy of Caroline Starks showed the toddler had died from a single shot from the .22-caliber rifle. The death has been ruled accidental and no charges will be filed, he said in a telephone interview with the Los Angeles Times.
“Most everybody in town is pretty devastated by this,” White said. “Nobody wants to take anyone’s guns away, but you’ve got to keep them out of harm’s way for the kids. It’s a safety issue.”

This is why pediatricians fight to do anticipatory guidance and talk to families about gun safety.
Nature:
The sharing of flu-virus data and materials has long been a politically charged issue in global health. Timely information from potentially pandemic flu strains is crucial for efforts to monitor drug resistance and the evolution of viruses, and for the development of diagnostics and vaccines. But some countries have been reluctant to share such data because they have seen little in return in terms of collaboration, technology transfer or access to the drugs and vaccines developed as a result. ...
Kristine Sheedy, a spokeswoman for the US CDC, acknowledges that “there were differences in understanding and expectations regarding use of the Chinese H7N9 sequence data by several outside groups”, but adds that the US CDC was not among them. The CDC has had a strong ongoing collaboration with its counterpart in China since the start of the H7N9 outbreaks, she says.

Jonathan Bernstein:
One thing that does help Boehner is that no one wants the job under these conditions; a conservative coup led by Majority Leader Eric Cantor could probably have succeeded at several points over the last two years, but Cantor would then find himself in exactly the same place as Boehner — those must-pass bills, after all, still would need to pass, and they still would need majority support in the Democratic Senate and they would still need Barack Obama’s signature, which would still mean that most of his conference would oppose anything that could pass and blame the Speaker for supporting it.
Overall, however, Boehner has probably done about as well a job as anyone could given the circumstances. Unless, that is, there’s someone out there who could fix the broken Republican Party. But that’s probably beyond the ability of anyone, including any possible Speaker of the House.

Greg Sargent:
President Obama is getting widely mocked by commentators and Republicans for using the phrase “permission structure” at his presser yesterday in the course of claiming that Republican officials are constrained from cooperating with him because their base would see it as a “betrayal.”
So it’s good to have a Republican Senator on record confirming that Obama is right about this.
I’m talking about Pat Toomey. The Senator from Pennsylvania didn’t directly address Obama’s remarks, but something he said in another context perfectly confirms the President’s diagnosis of the GOP.

Matt Miller:
Hence Cantor’s “Help Sick Americans Now Act.” Let Republicans back an approach they’ve philosophically endorsed before, Cantor thought, and by funding it a bit more generously than Obama has, show that the GOP can solve a problem that haunts (and often bankrupts) luckless families.
That was the idea. Then — boom! — conservatives revolted. L. Brent Bozell III cried “Cantorcare.” The Club for Growth warned that a vote for the measure would be tantamount to supporting Obamacare on their coveted conservative score card. “We often say we don’t need this Democrat big-government program [but then say] we need this Republican big-government program,” harrumphed Rep. Trey Radel of Florida. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas urged the party to skip this sideshow and get back to the real issues: the debt ceiling and spending cuts.
Wow. It almost makes you feel sorry for Cantor.

145,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/17/Obama-Throws-a-Tantrum-Over-Gun-Control-Defeat,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Obama Throws Tantrum over Gun Control Defeat,"
President Barack Obama lashed out defiantly and viciously at political opponents who defeated his efforts to expand federal gun regulations today. Standing with families of victims of the Newtown school shooting at the White House, the president claimed that opponents of expanded federal background checks had “no coherent arguments” for their position, and that the “gun lobby” had “willfully lied” in the course of the debate.
Ironically, while accusing others of lying, President Obama resorted to false claims and statistics about current laws, including the repeatedly debunked argument that 40% of gun sales are private, and that guns can be bought over the Internet without background checks. It was partly the dishonesty of those very arguments that had led potential supporters of new bipartisan legislation to doubt the administration’s motives in supporting the bill.
The administration’s defeat came earlier Wednesday, when the Senate failed to pass a cloture motion to end debate on a bipartisan proposal introduced by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Only 54 votes of the necessary 60 votes could be found to support an expanded federal background check system (among other changes), partly because of fears that extending such checks would require the creation of a federal gun registry that could lead to confiscation.
The failure brought an end to four months of fervent campaigning by the president during which he used the Newtown disaster–or, in the eyes of many critics, exploited it–to make an argument about the urgent need for new laws, even if such laws would not have prevented the Newtown atrocity itself. Many Democrats rallied behind him, hoping at first to pass a new assault weapons ban, then abandoning that effort for more modest regulations.
Along the way, the administration lost the support of Democratic Senators in conservative states, many of whom will face re-election in 2014. President Obama made clear his intention to use Wednesday’s defeat to rally supporters against Republicans, whom he blamed directly and angrily, suggesting that they had defied the will of the American people and attempted to silence the families of Newtown victims who had a “right” to be heard in the debate.
Forced to cover a rare political defeat for the president, the mainstream media largely echoed his emotions. Virtually all of CNN’s correspondents agreed that the Manchin-Toomey bill had been defeated because of the power of the National Rifle Association and the fear of politicians afraid to take on Second Amendment activists. None considered that support for gun control has been declining, or that the legislation itself was deeply flawed.
Again and again, President Obama noted that 90% of Americans, and a majority of National Rifle Association members, supported expanded background checks. The former constitutional law lecturer seemed to expect that that majority’s will should be self-executing, ignoring the fact that constitutional rights like the Second Amendment exist precisely to protect minorities against majoritarian passions and presidential demagoguery.
Indeed, while the president described the failure of the legislation as a failure of “Washington,” it was also–and primarily–a failure of his administration. A White House operation and Obama campaign apparatus that is regarded as brutally effective ought to have been able to sell a proposal allegedly supported by 90% of the voting public. Yet persistent troubles in execution and failures of policy raise questions about whether Obama secretly preferred failure to success.
His opponents, the president insisted, refused to make it more difficult for “dangerous criminals” to buy weapons–ignoring one of the core arguments of the other side, namely that dangerous criminals frequently ignore the law to obtain weapons, while law-abiding citizens bear the burden of new rules and restrictions. He reduced his opponents’ motives to pure politics, accusing them of being afraid of being punished by an organized, determined minority.
Rarely have Americans ever seen a president attack his opponents so viciously, expressing and evoking such visceral emotions–especially at a time of mourning. President Obama’s tirade contrasted with his reserved, measured response to the Boston Marathon bombings, in which he urged Americans to speak and act with restraint. If this has been, as he claimed, “a pretty shameful day in Washington,” the president’s tantrum was the most shameful moment of all. "

The Washington Post:
Life does go on, through Columbine in 1999, through Virginia Tech in 2007, through Sandy Hook in 2012. Each atrocity provides a jolt to the nation and then recedes with little effect, until the next unimaginable event occurs, except each time a little more imaginable. Everything was supposed to change after a man with a semiautomatic weapon mowed down 20 elementary school children in their classrooms last December. But for the politicians, nothing changed. Now, another massacre, another roster of funerals. Again, again, again.
Robin Abcarian at The Los Angeles Times:
There is no mass shooting devastating enough, disgusting enough or shocking enough that the U.S. Congress would be moved to enact reasonable gun legislation like the measures proposed in April by President Obama after 20 first-graders were mowed down last year in Newtown, Conn. [...]
And, as it turns out, when you are the NRA or in its pocket, there is never a ""right time"" to talk about rational gun measures.
So here we are again, another mass shooting in the news, another moment when gun control advocates must once again lean into the fray and not allow themselves be intimidated by people who would rather offer a prayer for the dead than do anything to prevent more killing.

David Frum:
I write on the day of the killing. Gun enthusiasts say it is inappropriate to talk about gun violence at the time it occurs. Better to wait … and wait … and wait … until time has passed, and the weeping next of kin have vanished from TV, and it’s safe to return to business as usual. The idea of the gun enthusiasts is that the way to show respect for the victims of gun violence is to do everything possible to multiply their number.
Yet the gun enthusiasts do have one point on their side: for all the horror of these massacres, they are only a small part of the story of gun violence in America. Most casualties of gun violence will not die at the hands of a mentally disturbed killer seeking random victims. Most gun casualties occur in the course of quarrels and accidents between people who would be described as “law-abiding, responsible gun owners” up until the moment that they lost their temper or left a weapon where a four-year-old could find it and kill himself or his sister.

Head below the fold for more analysis on this tragedy.


The Chicago Tribune:
Subtract the military setting and the backdrop of the nation's capital, and you have a tragically common event: workplace homicide. Nobody shows up for work anticipating a spray of gunfire into the employee cafeteria. But homicides account for 1 out of 10 fatal on-the-job injuries, according to a 2010 study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [...]
Eighty percent of those homicides involved guns. The shooters included robbers, estranged partners and angry clients; co-workers or former co-workers accounted for only 12 percent. [...]
Police in Washington haven't volunteered a motive in the Navy Yard carnage. There's no evidence of terrorism, they say, but they haven't ruled it out. In the end, like so many workplace attacks, it could well be attributed to two things: A lethal grudge. And a gun.

The Washington Post's Eugene Robinson:
Opponents of gun control argue that, instead of infringing Second Amendment rights, we should focus on the fact that most, if not all, of these mass shooters are psychologically disturbed. But many of the officials who take this view are simultaneously trying their best to repeal Obamacare, which will provide access to mental health services to millions of Americans who are now uninsured.
So what difference did it really make what motivated Monday’s shooting? Beyond tightening security at military bases, what is our sclerotic political system capable of doing to prevent the next slaughter of innocents?

The Hartford Courant:
Just five months ago, a mile and a half away at the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Senate defeated a compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun purchases, despite vast public support for the proposal.
The gun control proposals had followed the horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December, where a deranged gunman killed 20 children and six educators before taking his own life. The Senate proposal would have required background checks for sales at gun shows and the Internet, closing glaring loopholes in current law.
Is there a place in America that hasn't been touched by a mass shooting? Has it become part of life in this country? About 3,000 people, military and civilian, work in the building where the shooting took place. We ask for senators who voted against the gun control bill to go down there tomorrow and look them in the eye.

147,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/04/27/1203495/-GunFAIL-XV,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,GunFAIL XV,"












This week's compilation includes: three police-involved accidents, two of which occurred during gun training classes; three ""home invasion shootings""( i.e., when one Patriot elects to share a Liberty Projectile with a neighbor, via a Freedom Wall, Window, Floor or Ceiling); five accidents while cleaning loaded guns; three hunting accidents; one concealed carry ninja who shot himself taking his gun out of his pocket, and one who was shot by a child reaching into his pocket. And speaking of the kids, there were nine victims of GunFAIL this week, aged 10 months, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11 and 14. You may have noticed that that's not nine ages. It was a particularly rough week for the 10-year-olds, of which we lost two, and saw one wounded.
Stories of particular note this week include that of the second Carolinian to leave a gun behind in a New York hotel this month; a tee-ball rage shooting; the opening of turkey hunting season (resulting in the shooting of two turkey hunters and an undetermined number of turkeys), and; a potential Idiot Hall of Fame entry involving the Florida man (of course) who tried to convert his BB gun to .40-caliber using nothing but household tape and American Exceptionalism. Why have a firing chamber? Why have a barrel? Let's cut out the middle man! Sure, it sounds stupid and you'll end up wounding yourself, but let's face it, put a suit on that guy and let his stupid idea cost jobs instead of bandages, and he'd be in line for a fat bonus.
Now, without further ado, the week's dishonor roll, below the fold.



WACO, TX, 3/18/13: Police responding to a domestic disturbance call found a man struggling to restrain his grandson, who was agitated and holding an AR-15. The cops shot grandpa. But that would totally never happen in a crowded theater.
GROSSE POINTE PARK, MI, 4/06/13: Grosse Pointe Park police arrested a 20-year-old Detroit man April 6 after he accidentally shot a 9mm handgun into the floor of a home in the 1000 block of Beaconsfield. The man was trying to make the gun safe when it discharged.
OTTAWA, KS, 4/13/13: No one was injured when a “negligent” rifle shot rang out Saturday night inside a residence in the 1600 block of South Cedar Street in Ottawa. Dylan Spencer, 22, Ottawa, was arrested by Ottawa police about 7 PM on suspicion of unlawfully discharging an AR-15 rifle in his apartment, according to a police report. The bullet exited his apartment, passed through both walls of an occupied apartment and lodged into a utility pole. But of course, Dylan didn't think the gun was loaded. So it's cool.
KLAMATH FALLS, OR, 4/13/13: An investigation into the shooting death of Lee Roy Myers, 47, has been ruled accidental. The Klamath County Major Crimes Team was called to investigate a shooting on Saturday, April 13. An autopsy concluded the cause of death was an accidental, self-inflicted handgun wound.
SOUTHAMPTON, NY, 4/13/13: The report states that the detective visited the home and interviewed the man, who legally owned the Ruger 10/22 rifle. The man said he was cleaning the rifle when it accidentally discharged into his big toe. When the rifle was pointed in a downward angle, inertia caused the firing pin to strike the primer, which caused the rifle to fire, according to the incident report. The detective advised the man on safety techniques while cleaning his rifle. (Step one: unload it.)
CONROE, TX, 4/14/13: Conroe police officers arrested a 33-year-old man after his 3-year-old son fired a 9mm handgun in their apartment April 14 at the Carriage Woods Apartments, located at 1515 Wilson Road. The bullet lodged in the ceiling of the apartment, and the child suffered a minor injury on his face from the gun’s recoil.
ALEXANDRIA, VA, 4/15/13: Alexandria police report that a man staying in a hotel room in the city’s West End accidentally discharged a firearm. The incident occurred at 11:55 PM April 15 in the 5000 block of Seminary Road. The only hotel in the area is the Hilton Alexandria Mark Center Hotel. The firearm was legal, according to police reports. No injuries were reported.
NEW YORK, NY, 4/15/13: A North Carolina man visiting the Sept. 11 memorial and discovering that firearms were not permitted, hastily stashed his gun (legally owned, though not permitted for New York) in the cushions of a seat in the lobby of a World Trade Center-area hotel. And left it there. The timing wasn't great, either. Apparently, it happened just minutes before the Boston Marathon bombing, so when it was found shortly thereafter, it set off a full-blown security panic. Returning later and finding the gun missing, he did not report it to police. Seems he thought ""whoever found it, they would contact him and want a reward,” a relative told police. How they'd find him remains a mystery, but we'll count that as one vote in favor of a national registry of firearms owners. One other note: this is the second Carolinian to leave a gun behind in a New York hotel this month.
NASHVILLE, TN, 4/15/13: Christ Presbyterian Academy student Coleman Spann was arrested and charged with possessing firearms on school property Monday.

A 25-year-old Watkinsville man shot himself in the hand when he tried to disassemble a pistol with a live round, deputies said. Both incidents were investigated by Oconee deputies, who determined no foul play was involved in either case, Sheriff Scott Berry said Monday. Both men simply were careless in their handling of loaded weapons, said Berry, who called the shootings “negligent discharges.” The Watkinsville man told deputies he had cleaned his Glock pistol, reassembled it, loaded a magazine, and chambered a live round, when his friend asked to look at the barrel. The man “placed his left hand over the end of the barrel of the hand gun, squeezed the trigger which is required for disassembly, and the live round went off,” according to a deputy’s report, striking the man in the left hand.

He was fishing about 100 yards away from a gun class at the Whitesboro Rodeo Grounds around 2 PM on Saturday, Sheriff's Office Lt. Rickey Wheeler said. Deputies say the CHL class teacher is not state-certified and there was no berm or backstop to absorb the bullets. The bullet went through the man's body, missing his heart by a few inches. Instructor Ramsey tells News 12 he received certification from a 2-day NRA program back in March and has been teaching classes in Bridgeport and Whitesboro, but Lt. Wheeler says CHL instructors in Texas have to be certified by the state.

SPARKMAN, AR, 4/21/13: Responsible Gun OwnerTM shoots a hunting buddy in the leg trying to pull a .40 caliber handgun out from between two seats in the truck. Sure, he'd been drinking, but it's not actually against the law to be drunk and play with your guns in Arkansas, which is why it would have been awesome for Arkansans to help out up in Boston last week with their AR-15s. Anyhoo, the buddy who got shot in the leg died, which I'm sure didn't happen because people were too drunk to remember to put a tourniquet on him. Plus, the prosecutor, ""says he's convinced the death was accidental."" Good enough for Arkansas.

According to authorities, an officer with the Norristown Police Department was training at the facility when he accidentally shot himself in the leg.
GAINESVILLE, FL, 4/25/13: So, let's say you're a convicted felon who's prohibited by law from having a gun, but you've also got a compelling need to shoot a squirrel. What do you do? Well, you could get a BB gun, right? And so this fellow did. But what if you also have some compelling need to shoot that squirrel with .40-caliber ammunition? What do you do then? Well, how about taping a .40-cal. cartridge to the gun, and striking the primer with the BB pellet? Won't that work? Sure it will! If you don't mind having the cartridge explode, fragment, and hit you with the shrapnel, that is! Oh, and we probably should have mentioned that it's also illegal for you to have the ammunition. That might've helped short circuit this whole idiotic episode. But then again, criminals don't follow laws (except for the one about the gun, which he did, but forget about that), so screw it.
MARENGO, OH, 4/25/13: Sheriff’s deputies say a 10-year-old central Ohio boy died when he was accidentally shot while he and other children were playing with a shotgun. The Morrow County Sheriff’s Office said Dalton Wayne Taylor was shot in the chest in his family’s garage at about 6 PM Thursday near Marengo, about 40 miles north of Columbus. The sheriff’s office said it is unclear who fired the gun and how, but Dalton apparently did not shoot himself. The gun was left in the garage with other hunting gear. Deputies didn’t know if it was unloaded prior to the children finding it or if the juveniles loaded it. The boy’s father was home at the time but was in the backyard, the sheriff’s office said.
STEUBENVILLE, OH, 4/25/13: Yes, that Steubenville. Another guy who initially told the cops he was attacked and shot ends up admitting he was playing with a gun and shot his own damn self.
COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, 4/25/13: Everybody sing! ""Three people drinking in an apartment! Three people drinking! If one of those people should happen to decide to clean a loaded gun, three people drinking in an apartment, minus one!"" Actually, the guy lived. So that's good.
BOONE, NC, 4/26/13: A 10-year-old was seriously injured after he was apparently the victim of an accidental shooting late Friday afternoon. UPDATE: Mystery solved! He was shot by somebody who, ""fired one round after cleaning his gun in what he thought was a safe direction."" No charges filed. Because he thought it was safe! But note to the file here: down into the ground is usually thought to be pretty safe, too.
STONY POINT, NY, 4/26/13: A man was en route to the hospital with what officials said was a gunshot wound to the arm after accidentally shooting himself.

Today, former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), who was famously shot by mentally ill Jared Lee Loughner in Tucson, Arizona, testified before the Senate on gun control. While Giffords and her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, testified that they weren’t there as victims but as Americans, the reverse was clearly the case: as shooting victims, they have been trotted out by the left-leaning media to provide Cindy Sheehan-like “absolute moral authority.” The implication: disagree with the politics of these victims, and you don’t care enough about them.
The media coverage of Giffords’ testimony exploited Giffords’ victimhood to the hilt. But The Atlantic led the way with a picture of her “handwritten notes,” which The Atlantic labeled “pen-scrawled words … deliberate … diligent … written on a surface all too familiar to schoolchildren: binder paper.” And, The Atlantic added, “She is trapped in her injury. And few things make that point more powerfully than a piece of binder paper and a hand-scrawled message.”
The Atlantic got the photo from the Washington Post, which had put it up. Buzzfeed, too, put up the photo, quoting the Americans for Responsible Solutions Facebook page:
It will be hard. But the time is now. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you” – Like and share Gabby Giffords’ handwritten testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun violence. Join her and Mark Kelly by texting SOLUTIONS to 90975.
So did ThinkProgress. And Business Insider.
Except that Giffords didn’t scrawl that message. Her speech therapist did.
That doesn’t mean that Giffords doesn’t think the things that her therapist wrote. It does show, however, how far the media is willing to go in order to exploit shooting victims to further the gun control agenda. 
It is Giffords’ choice to be there. It is the Democrats’ and media’s and President Obama’s choice to exploit her presence. Then again, the left has never been shy about hiding behind victims to push their politics.

I've been told that here we are a ""reality-based community.""  I do see some signs of that as finally, after years of outright hostility towards people who were trying to point out that the Democratic party establishment is on the take by the same moneyed corporatists cartels that own the Republican party establishment, more and more kossacks are beginning to accept that obvious fact.
But there is a topic I want to check on to assess whether we are actually making enough progress when it comes to being a ""reality-based"" community.  I'll keep it short, since I think it is pretty straightforward...
You do know that so-called stand-your-ground, concealed-carry, ""castle-doctrine,"" and many other laws and regulations having to do with arming the population to the teeth have been pushed by corporatist business cartels like ALEC, and the gun industry, and the myriad astroturf front groups and think tanks they fund, right?
Now, you may ask, ""why would 'business' groups, or corporatist cartels would put so much effort on arming the population?""
Let's get a couple of facts out the way: The U.S. is in the final stages of a transition towards a plutocratic corporatocracy.  I'm going to save space here and instead recommend these three information resources as support to this statement: ""America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy,"" Lawrence Lessig: We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim.
And by now, you must also be aware about the fact that the entire U.S. mainstream media has the overall effect of a mind-numbing propaganda machine that serves the interests of the corrupt ruling class by spreading lies, misinformation, and false narratives. I'll direct you to this information resource: ""America's Sell Out Intellectuals and the Perks They Get.""
Now, after getting that out of the way, hopefully by now you see where I'm going since if those two facts are accepted as such, then the rest is easy to understand...
The ruling elite is currently engaging in a massive looting and pillaging of the country's wealth, mainly by increasingly exploiting and subjugating the citizenry.
Whatever is left of democracy is being systematically dismantled, along with our constitutional rights.  The proper functioning of government is being purposely atrophied by a well-planned and systematic de-funding strategy.
That's where all the talk about ""entitlement"" reforms and ""austerity"" is coming from.
As this happens, the social safety net is dismantled, and with it, the social fabric starts to unravel.
Eventually this creates a siege mentality on affected groups, starting with the very poor and dispossessed, followed by those who are near poverty, and up the economic ladder.  
This eventually exacerbates divisions based on economic class, ethnicity, religious beliefs, etc...
When conditions get sufficiently bad (due to increased austerity policies, which by the way, are being imposed on purpose), once you flood communities with guns, and once you put in place a regime of laws that expand the justification for justifiable homicides,  then you've created the perfect conditions for people to start shooting at each other.
Once people start shooting and getting away with it, then the business cartels keep pushing more and more boiler-plate laws expanding the justification for more shootings.
Eventually this will bring about a situation where you will have mainly right wing groups across the country armed to the teeth, emboldened to intimidate social justice activists as the conditions deteriorate due to the imposition of austerity, i.e., purposely defunding the proper functioning of government (of the the people and by the people).
What's behind all this? That's also pretty straightforward.  What these fascistic business cartels are doing is taking down the regulatory infrastructure, the social safety net, and etc., in order to eventually align labor costs to those of developing countries.  Yes, folks, it's about money; it's about putting a fascist boot on your neck, figuratively and literally.
So there you have it.  That's what's happening.
Now, some people may refuse to believe that there could be people so evil as to purposely and systematically help in bringing about the conditions for this type of mayhem.
Think again.  These billionaires funding this stuff are as much as fascists thugs as any other tyrant in history.
You haven't seen half of what these people are capable of--yet.

One of the most powerful pieces of feature journalism I’ve read in a long time is on the front-page of Sunday’s New York Times. It’s the first chapter in a series by Mike McIntire--who’s now obviously on a beeline to the annual Pulitzer finals--on “the gun industry's influence and the wide availability of firearms in America,” titled: “Selling a New Generation on Guns.” I’ll get to this “must-read” in a few paragraphs, but I’m going to “get a little tangential” first.
Question: If there’s a national protest against gun violence, and it’s not covered on Daily Kos, does that mean it doesn’t matter?
I’ve got to ask: What’s going on here?
Unless I’m missing something (and I hope I have), there wasn’t a single mention (please, tell me this isn’t so, and I’ll remove this section of this post) in this community regarding THIS national story, yesterday: Co-sponsored by the Washington Arena Stage and “One Million Moms for Gun Control,” thousands of protestors against gun violence filled Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.; and according to Reuters, “…One Million Moms organized similar events on Saturday in about a dozen cities, including San Francisco and Austin, Texas.”
(Clarification, as noted in the comments, down below: This is  “One Million Moms for Gun Control,” and it's NOT affiliated with an anti-LGBT group with a similar name.)


WASHINGTON | Sat Jan 26, 2013 9:37pm EST
(Reuters) - Thousands of marchers rallied in Washington in favor of gun control on Saturday, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, where a mass elementary school shooting reignited the U.S. gun violence debate.
Speakers - including Education Secretary Arne Duncan, lawmakers and actors - urged the protesters carrying such signs as ""What Would Jesus Pack?"" to lobby Congress and state legislators to back gun control measures…
…
""…This is about gun responsibility. This is about gun safety. This is about fewer dead Americans, fewer dead children, fewer children living in fear,"" Duncan said.
Organizers backed President Barack Obama's call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and background checks for all gun sales. They also urged safety training for all buyers of firearms.
Marchers stretched for several blocks along Constitution Avenue as they approached the rally site in the shadow of the Washington Monument…

Elsewhere in Washington, less than 48 hours earlier, as fellow Kossack Meteor Blades informed us: “Sen. Feinstein's assault weapons ban will face stiff resistance from some elected Democrats.”
As One Million Moms’ protestor Amy Journo, a Newtown, CT resident with two sons, five and seven years old, who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School, noted in the Reuters story (linked and excerpted above):  
""It's difficult to get laws changed when politicians are bought out, but we have to start somewhere…I want to ensure that they (children) are safer, not just my children but all across the United States.""
And, this quote brings us (back) full-circle to Mike McIntire’s stunning feature story in Sunday’s NY Times.
As you’ll learn in the article--god forbid, if anyone was ever going to walk into an elementary school classroom with an assault weapon again—if the Newtown, CT-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has their way, eight-year-olds throughout America will be fully proficient with firearms, up to and including semi-automatic assault weapons; and, they’ll have the knowledge and skills necessary to take the shooter out!
I mean, “seriously!” Why waste taxpayer money on training educators how to handle guns, when you may accomplish the same end result by encouraging the parents of students in the second grade to pay for their kids to learn how to handle AR-15s and semi-automatic pistols, instead?
Apparently, as we learn in today’s NYT, this is the logic behind the NSSF’s “First Shots” program. And then, as it’s explained in Mike McIntire’s piece, you’ll learn more about folks like, “Larry Potterfield, the founder of MidwayUSA, one of the nation’s largest sellers of shooting supplies… who said his own children started shooting ‘boys’ rifles’ at age 4, getting young people engaged with firearms — provided they have the maturity and the physical ability to handle them — strengthens an endangered American tradition.”
You’ll also read about “Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 — an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one — the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.”
“Who knows?” it said. “Maybe you’ll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under your tree some frosty Christmas morning!”
And, then there’s this gem from Junior Shooters’ editor Andy Fink, who…
… acknowledged in an editorial that some of his magazine’s content stirred controversy.
“I have heard people say, even shooters that participate in some of the shotgun shooting sports, such things as, ‘Why do you need a semiautomatic gun for hunting?’ ” he wrote. But if the industry is to survive, he said, gun enthusiasts must embrace all youth shooting activities, including ones “using semiautomatic firearms with magazines holding 30-100 rounds.”
In an interview, Mr. Fink elaborated. Semiautomatic firearms are actually not weapons, he said, unless someone chooses to hurt another person with them, and their image has been unfairly tainted by the news media. There is no legitimate reason children should not learn to safely use an AR-15 for recreation, he said.

(Bold type is diarist’s emphasis.)
You really need to read McIntire’s entire article to get a sense of the truly savage, capitalistic nature of the matter.
In the meantime, speaking of capitalism and money, here’s the link to make a donation to “One Million Moms for Gun Control!”

151,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/09/CO-Democrat-Legislators-Declare-War-On-Guns,News,Breitbart,Democrat,Colorado Democrats Declare War on Guns,"

Colorado Democrats are prepared to launch an all-out war on guns with legislation that includes bans on “high capacity” magazines, requirements for universal background checks, fees for existing background checks, and allowing victims of gun violence to sue firearm manufacturers for the misuse of weapons.
The proposed ban on “high capacity” magazines and the call for universal background checks are both reflective of similar measures being pushed by Democrats around the country. 
As I have made clear in earlier posts, if universal background checks are implemented, they will not only stop private sales and close the “gun show loophole,” but will also take away a grandfather’s ability to simply give his favorite rifle to his grandson or for a mother to give a handgun to her daughter for self-defense. 
In both scenarios, the guns will have to be registered, the government will have to be notified, specified fees will have to be paid, and background checks will have to be performed. 
The measure to add a fee to existing background checks for gun purchases is nothing less than a new state-level tax on gun purchases. If this law passes, the fee could eventually be raised high enough to rule out buying a gun in the first place. 
The proposal to allow crime victims to sue gun manufacturers is very onerous for gun companies. Although it would ostensibly only apply to makers of “assault weapons” if implemented, Colorado state Sen. Greg Brophy (R) said it “is the equivalent of holding Coors, the distributor, and the 7-Eleven from which the 12-pack of beer was stolen responsible for the drunk-driving accident.”
Even if the law allowing Coloradans to sue gun manufacturers passes, it will be impossible to implement currently because a federal law bans lawsuits against gun manufacturers over the misuse of their products. 
The state’s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, has yet to show his hand regarding where he stands on all these proposals. One thing that is known is that 56% of Coloradans say the NRA best represents their views on guns and gun rights. "
152,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/17/Yesterday-Obama-Was-Not-My-President,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,"Yesterday, Obama Was Not My President--or Yours","
On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s My Pet Goat moment on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.
It was also an act that places Obama’s passivity during the Benghazi attacks–and his decision to fly to Las Vegas the next day for a campaign fundraiser–in perspective. This is a president who, even as Navy Seals approached Osama bin Laden’s hideout, retired to play cards with his pals. The image is of a man with little regard for the lives of Americans in “his” military, or their families, beyond their use as campaign props.
In addition, President Obama–like it or not–leads the entire nation, not just the majority that voted him into office. In moments of terror and tragedy, his job is to bring the American people together, not to split us apart. Conservatives have been willing–eager, even–to embrace Obama on such occasions, as many did after his speech at the memorial for the Tuscon victims in 2011. Yesterday, he foreclosed any such reconciliation. 
What we are seeing is partly the result of Obama’s political foundation as a community organizer–there is never a crisis to waste, so to speak, in stirring up your core supporters against their contrived opponents. But even Alinsky, who had enough sense to criticize those who called police “pigs,” would have counseled against Obama’s speech yesterday, which could not have brought more benefit than harm to his cause.
Yes, Obama did begin by acknowledging the Navy Yard attacks. That is, at least, an improvement from how he reacted to the Ford Hood shooting in 2009, which he only mentioned after several “shout-outs” to his supporters in the audience. 
Yet the speech itself should have been canceled, or postponed. The fact that the White House never even considered that option shows how out of touch Obama is with his basic duties.
A story comes to mind, told by a friend in Chicago who met Obama during his obscure State Senate years. Obama was at a local function for medical professionals, and my friend, having just met the Senator from Hyde Park, tried to introduce him to a friend from the same neighborhood. In the nervous rush of the moment, he forgot that friend’s name. “Well, I guess he isn’t your friend, is he,” Obama deadpanned.
Obama then presented his business card, said, “You’ll be hearing about me,” turned, and left, leaving the two men in shock at his rudeness. 
That’s the real Obama–the one slowly emerging in presidential biographies now that he is safely ensconced in a second term, the one who drops even the most loyal aides when he feels they are no longer of use to him, the man capable of relating to large crowds but not concrete human beings.
Speaker of the House John Boehner said that Obama’s speech was a “shame.” Charles Krauthammer said that it was in “extremely bad taste.” It was worse than that. It was an insult to the victims and their families, a slap in the face to the nation as a whole, a dereliction of the simplest duty of empathy and discretion. He may apologize–he ought to–but what Obama revealed about himself in that moment can never be undone.

While we pray for those murdered and everyone who might be in danger, we cannot forget that the media and its allies in the Democratic Party have set a standard when it comes to reporting on the possible political motives of mass murderers. Though they generally make things up to turn the death of innocents into a talking point against the Right, it is still the left who set this precedent.   
And what do you know, Chris Dorner, the former police officer suspected of being behind the murder rampage presently unfolding in Los Angeles, has apparently left behind a manifesto addressed to America that the media are already selectively reporting on to leave out the more inconvenient portions. You see, there is no political upside for the media to reveal the politics of this suspected madman. 
What is being reported as Mr. Dorner’s manifesto not only endorses Hillary Clinton for president in 2016 and vigorously defends Barack Obama and the Democrats’ current gun control push; he also savages the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre while expressing all kinds of love for some of the biggest stars in the left-wing media — by name. 
No Tea Partier is this suspected mass murderer, who just might be politically motivated:
Chris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite’s lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. …
Willie Geist, you’re a talented and charismatic journalist.
Mr. Dorner also seems to have a soft spot for those the media tells us are “safe” Republicans to like, such as George H. W. Bush and Chris Christie, “the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary.”
When it comes to defending Obama, Dorner sounds like he’s been watching an awful lot of NBC News:
You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents.
Mr. Dorner’s gun control views make it sound as though much of his thinking has been affected by CNN. In a paragraph that mentions Sandy Hook, Dorner writes:
If you had a well regulated AWB, this would not happen. The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don’t give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That’s bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants.
Those sound just like Piers Morgan’s talking points, no? Well, surprise-surprise, Dornan agrees 100% with Morgan on gun control, though he does worry that Morgan is hurting the cause:
Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws[.]
The manifesto is thousands of word long and mentions dozens of people and topics. But politically, the manifesto is pretty clear. 
Which is why the media will downplay it with the same amount of energy they put into amplifying their lies.

How big of a wake-up call are the Obama scandals, especially the ones surrounding the seizing of phone records from the Associated Press and the IRS’s targeting of conservatives? So big that two of the media’s most shameful and shameless gun control advocates — Joe Scarborough and Piers Morgan — have finally conceded that arguments made by pro-Second Amendment activists against the expanding of background checks might not be so ridiculous. 
In a roundtable discussion on Friday’s “Morning Joe,”  Scarborough said that because of the IRS scandal, “My argument is less persuasive today because of these scandals.” He added: “People say, ‘Hey, if they do this with the IRS, asking people what books you read, then how can I trust them with information about my Second Amendment rights?'”
Mika agreed completely: “That is a really, really good point.” Even the Huffington Post’s Sam Stein agreed. 
Andrew Johnson at NRO grabbed the video:

Scarborough added that, when it comes to both background checks and immigration reform, the IRS scandal is “devastating,” because both of those pieces of legislation ask us to trust the kind of government that would seize the media’s phone records and use the IRS to target a president’s political foes.
Also courtesy of NRO, here is no-less than Piers Morgan conceding he was wrong to ridicule gun-rights activists (including our own Ben Shapiro) for making the argument that a legitimate fear of government tyranny is what makes the Second Amendment so crucial:

—
Though I was appalled by the media’s relentless and shameless push last month to pass the Toomey-Manchin bill that would have tightened background checks, I did support its passage, and said so many times while criticizing the media for their disgusting behavior. But this chilling reminder of how corrupt the federal government is has changed my mind completely. 
Moreover, our government is not only corrupt, it is vigorously protected by a media that is just as corrupt (NEVER forget the media ignored, dismissed, and even defended the IRS targeting conservatives). The government and media can scream all they want that background checks won’t be used to create a backdoor registry…
But the government and media are liars.

Reading the Left’s fevered desires over at Slate isn’t anything new. 
Not even articles breathlessly titled and subtitled:
Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.
Not even articles that read:
The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. …
Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition’s most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray.
Slate is what it is and some bloodthirsty Slate writer orgasmic over the prospect of Obama permanently pulverizing and destroying the GOP is as noteworthy as green on grass.
Oh, except after someone like Brit Hume connects the dots. 
The author of this outrageous left-wing fever dream is John Dickerson, whom Slate describes as “Slate’s chief political correspondent”. What Slate leaves out of its little bio, though, is that Dickerson is also the political director at CBS News. 
Dickerson is merely being Dickerson, and  there’s no doubt he speaks for legions upon legions of those in the media today. 
What is worthy of note, though, is that a CBS News’ political director is now comfortable openly calling for the destruction of the Republican Party. He obviously fears no admonitions from his colleagues or his employer. And why should he? Earlier this week, Bob Schieffer, a CBS News “living legend,” was perfectly comfortable publicly comparing the NRA to Nazis. 
You lump all of this with CNN chief Jeff Zucker applauding Piers Morgan’s shameless feasting off the dead children of Sandy Hook for ratings and attention, and what you have is a media that’s finally … coming out. 
And yet, even as they do, even as they openly celebrate their left-wing biases out of one side of their mouth, out the other, they will claim they remain objective and unbiased. 
The Big Lie has officially arrived. 
And somewhere Dan Rather’s thinking, “Oh, so now it’s okay!?”

Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don’t give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That’s bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants.
Those sound just like Piers Morgan’s talking points, no? Well, surprise-surprise, Dornan agrees 100% with Morgan on gun control, though he does worry that Morgan is hurting the cause:
Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws[.]
The manifesto is thousands of word long and mentions dozens of people and topics. But politically, the manifesto is pretty clear. 
Which is why the media will downplay it with the same amount of energy they put into amplifying their lies.

The mainstream media have awoken to the fact that President Barack Obama’s partisan attack on Republicans during the Navy Yard attack on Monday may not have been the best idea, even if only for tactical reasons. 
The New York Times‘ Maureen Dowd worried that Obama’s speech meant that he “cannot seem to connect anymore” and concluded that the president had been “overtaken by events.” The Hill called it a political “blunder” and agreed, via a quote from a “former aide,” that he had been “overtaken by events.” (Poor President Obama, always the victim of circumstances not of his own making, always “overtaken by events”!)
While it is encouraging that the media have noticed Obama’s attack–even though most networks cut away after he briefly mentioned the Navy Yard shooting–they continue to ignore three glaring problems:
1. The fact that Obama never considered canceling or postponing the speech. A president who does not realize that a mass shooting on a military base in the nation’s capital city is a reason to suspend politics as usual is dangerously removed from his duties as commander-in-chief–never mind the political damage. In addition, he is receiving bad advice, ignoring good advice, or simply not being advised by staff who have learned that he tunes out all but a select group of trusted Chicago insiders and loyalists. By putting politics first, the Obama administration is putting the nation at risk–at a time when risks are only growing.
2. The fact that the media pilloried Mitt Romney for lesser sins in 2012. When Mitt Romney issued a statement criticizing the Obama administration’s apologetic response to the Cairo embassy attack on Sep. 11 last year, the media attacked him viciously. Romney, too, was “overtaken by events”: he did not know that four Americans would be killed in Benghazi. But the media never let Romney forget his alleged gaffe, while giving Obama a pass for his inaction that night. Because the media never hold Obama accountable for anything, he rarely takes his governing responsibilities seriously, exacerbating a dangerous vacuum in national leadership.
3. The fact that the Navy Yard attack happened at all, four years after Ft. Hood. It is easier for the Obama-supporting media to dwell on an inappropriate speech than to ask the much more important question: how did the attack happen at all? Four years after a similar mass shooting at Fort Hood, was nothing done to improve security at military bases? Why were rules restricting guns on base not changed?  Did the Obama administration let the nation’s guard down by downplaying Ft. Hood as “workplace violence” instead of terrorism? Why, after the NSA scandal, was there no review of security clearance procedures and lists?"

Gun control. That's what it was called before Newtown. Remember how no one was talking about gun control?
Except for the NRA. They never stopped talking about it. This is from June 2012:
President Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election.
In a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists ""Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment."" We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here...
The NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn't enough evidence for such a sweeping claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.

For an interesting reminder of how Newtown changed the President's priorities, check out this brief video from Bloomberg on Dec 19th, or this one, same date, with Chuck Todd, entitled Tipping Point:







David Maraniss has more:
If Dec. 14, 2012, was, as he said, his most difficult day in the White House, one unspoken aspect of his despair was a sense of deep remorse that, in the service of political survival, in the pursuit of power, in the obsession with avoiding traps, he had given little more than perfunctory attention to the issue of gun control. In word and deed since then, he has shown more passion and resolve. Perhaps the conscience of his late mother kicked in, her idealism finally overtaking his concern that people like her were too naive. Certainly the empathy of a father with young daughters had a transformative effect.
So does Jodi Kantor:
When the president returned from consoling families of teachers and children killed in the Newtown, Conn., massacre — he wept as they handed him photos and told him stories of victim after victim — aides could see in his face the toll of absorbing the nation’s traumas. “This is what I do,” Mr. Obama told them.
But it wasn't just the President. All over the country, from local forums to national platforms, everyone has been talking and debating about gun violence and what to do about it. From the Danbury News-Times:
Top police commanders from several of the state's cities and towns have thrown their weight behind Newtown police Chief Michael Kehoe, who inserted himself firmly into the gun-control debate last week by calling for a ban on assault weapons.
Because it isn't just the NRA now, the discussion has been much more thoughtful and balanced than this guy:
DAVID GREGORY: You don't think guns should be part of the conversation?
WAYNE LAPIERRE: I think that is the one thing that we can do immediately that will immediately make our children safe.
DAVID GREGORY: Is it the only thing?
WAYNE LAPIERRE: Gun control, you could ban all Dianne Feinstein's, you could do whatever she wants to do with magazines, it's not going to make any kid safer. We've got to get to the real problems, the real causes. And that's what the N.R.A. is trying to do.
And I think, I'll tell you this, I have people all over the country calling me saying, ""Wayne, I went to bed safer last night because I have a firearm. Don't let the media try to make this a gun issue.""

The media didn't make it a gun issue. Shooting 20 first graders multiple times each—along with the brave adults who were shot trying to protect them from being massacred—made this a gun issue. Only a gun issue? No, not by any means. But a gun issue nonetheless? Despite LaPierre's tone-deaf response, yes.
And has it mattered? Here's the headline from the Jan 18th NY Times, referring to their own poll:
Massacre Sways Public in Way Others Did Not
The massacre of children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., appears to be profoundly swaying Americans’ views on guns, galvanizing the broadest support for stricter gun laws in about a decade, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll.
Here's an even broader view, looking specifically at the question (not all polls ask it) of making gun laws more strict:


Collation from pollingreport.com

Join us below the fold as we talk more about how Newtown changed the landscape.


Gallup captures changing public opinion:

Modified from gallup.com

Poll after public opinion poll shows the same thing. This one is from AP (here is the .pdf):
Some 58 percent favor strengthening gun laws in the United States. Just 5 percent felt such laws should be loosened, while 35 percent said they should be left unchanged.
In comparison, after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007, an Associated Press-Ipsos poll found that 47 percent wanted stricter gun laws, 38 percent thought they should remain as is and 11 percent wanted to see them loosened.

And this one is from Reuters (here are the topline results):
About three-quarters of Americans surveyed support proposals to ban the sale of automatic weapons, ban high-capacity ammunition clips and expand background checks on all gun buyers, according to an online Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.
Those proposals were at the heart of President Barack Obama's package of recommendations to Congress on Wednesday designed to curb gun violence after last month's elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six adults.

Speaking of the President's proposals, this Gallup poll actually looked at them.
Americans' immediate reaction to President Barack Obama's proposals for new laws designed to reduce gun violence is more positive than negative, with 53% saying they would want their representative in Congress to vote for the set of proposed new laws, while 41% say their representative should vote against them.
The only sub-groups that oppose it are conservatives and Republicans. Duh. Hugely popular in the East (68-30), marginally popular out West (47-45). Midwest (50-42) and South (49-44) okay with it.
Meanwhile and more broadly, the Republican response so far isn't encouraging. ""Lie about what you really think"" isn't a way to govern, it's a way to win elections. That's a distinction lost on many in the House, since they are not especially interested in governance. Then again, that's why their numbers are so bad. In this poll, the negative Republican number is at an all-time high. No, it's not the messaging. Yes, it's the policy content.

Republican party unfavorability at all-time high in NBC/WSJ poll

Until we see where they stand and where they actually vote on measures the President has suggested, I'm skeptical that they have the courage and the guts to stand up to the NRA leadership and support what the public and NRA membership wants.
But, and these are vital points to consider:
• The public supports specific parts of Obama's proposals and, in general, supports the concept of stricter gun laws.
• In 2011, NRA members supported specific proposals like background checks, and in July 2012, the same was true. Wayne LaPierre does not speak for all of them (even though 70% of NRA members are conservatives). Link
• After Newtown, 85% of NRA households support background checks. Link. (For the distinction between NRA households and members, see previous link - it's men vs women.)
• The Republican party itself is extremely unpopular, limiting the leverage of opposing everything for the sake of opposition.
• Obama is seen as a strong leader (61%, WaPo poll).
• The intensity, for a change, is not entirely on the side of the NRA (link):

From Washington Post polling

With those kinds of numbers, and a determined White House, don't assume anything about what happens next, even if the conventional wisdom is that nothing will pass Congress. It might be that, as speculated by many, the assault weapons ban gets traded for everything else (not a terrible outcome). Or it might be some other outcome entirely.
But understand that simply writing about the NRA's past successes is a lazy way to approach the issue. Things are simply not the same as the way they were before.
Ask anyone in Newtown.

159,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/11/Palin-Attends-Chris-Kyle-Funeral-At-Cowboys-Stadium,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Palin: Obama Should 'Pay His Respects' to Chris Kyle with 'Gesture of Condolence',"

Sarah Palin called on President Barack Obama to “pay his respects” to slain American hero Chris Kyle with “some gesture of condolence” before she, along with her husband, Todd, attended Kyle’s public memorial and funeral service in Dallas, TX Monday at Cowboys Stadium. The Palins became good friends with Kyle in the past two years. 
Kyle, the former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper, a New York Times bestseller, was murdered on February 2 at a Texas gun range, allegedly by a former Marine suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) whom Kyle was trying to help. 
In a Facebook note, Palin wrote she found it “sad to see that flags aren’t flying at half staff for this American hero” and hoped Obama “pays his respects in some gesture of condolence” for someone who “sacrificed so much to keep him and all of us safe.”
Obama has publicly acknowledged people like Sandra Fluke and famous rappers, but he is not attending Kyle’s funeral and did not issue a statement after Kyle’s death. 
“We may never know to what extent Chris kept us free or how many lives he saved by his brave actions in the line of fire. But his fellow warriors know how important he was. My son Track couldn’t meet Chris when Todd and I first met him because Track was deployed to Iraq,” Palin wrote. “Then when we got to know Chris even better, our son was deployed in Afghanistan. We’ve met a lot of people in recent years, and Track has been privileged to meet them as well. But he said about Chris, ‘Mom, he’s the ONE person in the entire world I would be star-struck to meet. He’s it.'”
Palin first met Kyle during the premiere of Stephen K. Bannon’s “The Undefeated” movie in Pella, Iowa in 2011. Kyle was in charge of security for that event.
After attending the funeral, Palin suggested ways to honor and remember Kyle and, in another Facebook posting, wrote:
It was a beautiful memorial service for Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium this afternoon. What a celebration of a great life! All in all, is there a finer human being who has crossed the 50-yard line star in Texas than Chris Kyle? Please click on the following link for information on how we can help out the families of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield. As patriotic Americans, this is a tangible way to show appreciation and support for good people. On a personal note, I thank you who’ve sent birthday greetings today, and it would be awesome if you’d join me in supporting the families of these heroes by helping them out!
The Palins got to know Kyle better when Todd Palin was on the show “Stars Earn Stripes” with Kyle. The Palins, along with the rest of the cast, spent a lot of time on set with Kyle’s family. Kyle was the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history. 
“God bless this great warrior,” Palin said. “Let us keep his wife and children in our prayers, and may we never forget him or his sacrifice.”

Michigan Republicans: Drunk with power, anti-women
Originally posted at Eclectablog.
As Amy and I have been writing about for quite some time now, Michigan Right to Life was able to gather enough signatures representing just 4.2% of Michigan voters to put a bill before the state legislature to force women to buy a special rider on their health insurance to cover abortions. They did this through an infrequently used device called the ""indirect initiated state statute"" which I describe in detail HERE.
Today, Republicans in the House and Senate passed the bill which now becomes law. It does not require the signature of Governor Rick Snyder who vetoed similar legislation last year because it does not make exceptions for cases of rape or incest. Because the new law does not make this exception, it has come to be known as the ""Rape Insurance"" bill. The ballot initiative, which is opposed by a majority of Michiganders, was deceptively titled the ""Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act"". This law doesn't allow women to ""opt out"". It FORCES women to opt in.


In this country, abortion has been legal for 40 years. And yet the forced birthers in America have spent the entire four decades since the Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision doing everything in their power to prevent women from having access to this legal medical procedure. Today's action by Michigan Republicans is one more cut in their ""death by a thousand cuts"" approach that has included terrorists activities such as bombing abortion clinics and murdering doctors who perform abortions.
It's worth noting that this new law does not just impact insurance provided by state or federal governments. It covers ALL insurance including private insurance. It begs a couple of questions: What are girls under the age of 26 who are their parents' health insurance supposed to do? Also, if you have health insurance through your employer, are you now required to inform them that you want this coverage? This would be a monstrous invasion of medical privacy.
None of this matters to the minority group of forced birthers who believe every pregnancy should end with the birth of a child even if it's the result of a rape or incest. Don't have the means to support a child but have an unplanned pregnancy and can't afford an abortion? That's tough. And you can sure the same legislators that voted for this egregious attack on women's reproductive rights will be there to cut your food stamps and other social safety net programs that will assist your child once it's born.
If a woman has a life-threatening problem with her pregnancy, the difficult choice to have an abortion will come with a doctor's bill to add one more level of pain to an otherwise painful situation, courtesy of Michigan Republicans.
The outrage over this new law is pouring in.
Democratic candidate for governor Mark Schauer:
This bill is a shameful attack on Michigan women. The fact is, this legislation will force Michigan women to pay more for health insurance and limit access to critical health care services for women who have been the victim of a crime. At a time when Michigan has the third worst unemployment rate in the nation, it’s clear that we need new leaders in Lansing who are focused on creating jobs instead of passing bills that hurt Michigan women and families.
Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer:
Whether a planned pregnancy has gone horribly wrong and a woman needs a medically necessary D & C procedure, or the deplorable and devastating acts of rape or incest have resulted in an unwanted pregnancy, the Senate Republicans’ passage of this cold-hearted rape insurance proposal means Michigan women now have to anticipate the unimaginable and plan to have these unspeakable things happen to them. This is the height of hubris and paternalism that a room full of men have decided they are fit to dictate the terms of Michigan women’s health care, that they can make this decision recklessly without giving a moment’s consideration to the various personal circumstances we women face, and it is an appalling example of political pandering that the Michigan Legislature is bending to the whims of a single high-powered and extreme special interest.
Democratic Senator Rebekah Warren:
To even claim that women will have the option of abortion insurance under this initiative is deceitful. Michigan is not the first state to take action on this issue; seven other states have already enacted this legislation. In five of these seven states, purchasing an abortion rider is not even an available option. In passing this initiative, we are allowing that 4% of Michigan’s people to dictate the health care options for 100% of Michigan women. For that reason, I firmly believe that this policy must be repealed as an insincere representation of the will of the people.
House Democrat Vicki Barnett:
Even with their own governor being against it, Right to Life went ahead and gave 3 percent of the population the voice for 100 percent of women in Michigan. Legislative Republicans are once again catering to the whims of special interest groups, and the citizens suffer. Now, Michigan woman need to plan ahead for ‘rape insurance’ in case the absolute worst happens.
House Democrat Marcia Hovey-Wright, Women’s Democratic Caucus Chairwoman:
A woman’s health care decisions should be made by herself, her doctor and her family. Health care decisions are private matters, and special interest groups shouldn’t be allowed to collude with government to intrude upon them.
House Democrat Ellen Cogen Lipton:
Republicans have been insisting that the government shouldn’t interfere with insurance company practices, but in this case, that’s exactly what they’re doing. It’s time for the so-called ‘party of small government’ to be exactly that. Republicans need to let the people have the final word on this terrible piece of legislation.
Progress Michigan executive director Lonnie Scott:
Today it’s official: Michigan Republicans truly view women as second-class citizens. On the one-year anniversary of Right to Work, the Republicans used the same divisive tactics and passed a controversial law that had no committee hearings and no chance for public input. Republicans should be ashamed of bowing down to special interests who have no regard for the well-being of women and not letting Michigan voters decide.”
In what can only be called a near-miracle, the law did not receive ""immediate effect"" in either the Senate or the House and will go into effect in March. Democratic Representative Sarah Roberts has pledged that there will be another indirect initiated state statute to overturn it and put the matter before voters.
If you think there isn't a Republican War on Women, you aren't paying attention. Today, they won another battle in this ongoing war.
Remember this in 2014. That's when we'll all have a chance to replace these hypocritical, drunk-with-power Republicans who want a government so small that it can fit inside a woman's uterus.

In his keynote address to the Republican Party of Iowa's Celebrate Life event last month, Mike Huckabee—former governor of Arkansas, failed candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, and now a host of his own talk show on Fox ""News""—compared abortion to the Holocaust.
It's not remarkable that he did so; forced-birthers have long been fond of oh-so-casually comparing a legal medical procedure to the religious genocide of millions. In fact, there is absolutely nothing remarkable about his speech, filled with standard anti-choice bile and nonsense—which is precisely what makes it remarkable. This is the ""pro-life"" movement, and Huckabee, who has for far too long been given a pass by the media as one of the ""nicer"" conservatives because he delivers his hate with a jolly smile, is one of its most prominent leaders. If you want to understand just how twisted, how hateful, how blatantly wrong and downright evil this movement really is, you need look no further than Huckabee's speech. Just be sure to keep Huckabee's own words in mind:
I actually carried out the death penalty 16 times more than any governor in my state's history.
Now head below the fold for Huckabee's impassioned plea for ""life.""


Huckabee begins his speech by describing Oskar Schindler, who, during the Holocaust, saved the lives of more than a thousand Jews by employing them in his factory.
The Jews have an expression: he who saves a life saves the whole world. I sometimes think that we could use a few more scoundrels. We could use a few more people who are notorious sinners—if, in fact, they would intervene on behalf of human life.
I ask you, who is the most righteous? Is it the person who sings the loudest, who prays the longest? Is it the person who has memorized the most Bible verses, but never lifts a finger to intervene on behalf of another human being's life or death? Or is the person who maybe has a lifestyle that is less than desirable, but who, when it really counts, is willing to stand between life and death for other human beings?

Let us pause for this brief reminder of Huckabee's own words: ""I actually carried out the death penalty 16 times more than any governor in my state's history.""
Okay, then, let's continue:
And now we're called into this incredible holocaust of our own in America. Fifty-five million babies. Fifty-five million babies since 1973 have died in what ought to be the safest place in the world: their mothers' womb. And it's become one of the most dangerous places for a baby to be.
For us, this is not about the politics of Democrat and Republican, winning and losing. It's about our capacity to one day stand before a holy god and give an account for whether we stood between life and death for those who had no voice but ours, who had no hands to raise and say ""no"" except ours.

And now for a little fact-checking interruption about why wombs are no safe haven. In 2010, Amnesty International released a report about the ""maternal health crisis"" in America:
The report, titled ""Deadly Delivery,"" notes that the likelihood of a woman's dying in childbirth in the U.S. is ﬁve times as great as in Greece, four times as great as in Germany and three times as great as in Spain. Every day in the U.S., more than two women die of pregnancy-related causes, with the maternal mortality ratio doubling from 6.6 deaths per 100,000 births in 1987 to 13.3 deaths per 100,000 births in 2006.
The report also found that ""one in four women do not receive adequate prenatal care,"" and that the majority of those deaths were easily preventable with improved access to affordable health care. Those unborn children, for whom Huckabee claims to be so concerned, are denied basic and necessary care even before they're born. That is what makes wombs so dangerous—and it has nothing to do with abortion.  
I want to mention today that the heart of the pro-life movement is not about trying to end abortion as much as it is to try to help people understand that abortion ends when we elevate every human life as a life of value. And the ultimate goal, and the message that we must articulate, is there is no such thing as a life that is expendable, disposable and unworthy of being treated with dignity and respect. Our founders said it eloquently in the Declaration of Independence. ""We hold these things, these truths, to be self-evident. That all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""
It is not the government who has the right to determine the value of our life or the nature of our death.

Remember: ""I actually carried out the death penalty 16 times more than any governor in my state's history.""
 
And our founders recognized this—though they didn't get it all right, they understood that all of us have a sense of equality because our equality comes from the fact that we have our roots and our origins, not merely by human hands, but that our creation is the result of a divine intervention. And they saw it that way. We're all created equal. Endowed by our creator with those unalienable rights. It is not the job of government to give life or to decide who gets to take it. It is the job of government to protect that which God has given us responsibility for, and in the case of an unborn child, it is the life of those most vulnerable that it is our duty to protect and to seek to preserve.
While Huckabee and his fellow conservatives may claim to believe it is the government's job to protect the unborn, they don't think the government has any business doing a damned thing for the born. That's why conservatives have fought against the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, early childhood education, nutritional assistance programs, child labor laws—basically anything that protects and provides for children—because of empty catch-phrases like ""free market"" and ""self-reliance"" and ""bootstraps.""
Now, we've spent, for the last 40 years in this country, since Roe v. Wade, we've taught the idea that life can be expendable if the life represents a social disruption or a financial hardship on the biological mother. I mean, that's the basis of abortion on demand. Well, I can't really carry this baby because I'd have to drop out of college. I can't carry the baby because it would cost me a promotion at work. I can't carry the baby because my mother would be furious at me if she finds out I'm pregnant. My father will never understand this. So for the purpose of our social disruptions, or sometimes for financial hardships, I can't afford the baby.
While Huckabee so easily and dismissively scoffs at the reasons why women might want to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, there's one young woman's name he should learn: Spring Adams, who died at the age of 13, when her father, who had raped and impregnated her, shot and killed her in her sleep after finding out she planned to obtain an abortion.
I understand the hardship, but I think we've got to be very careful never to be condemning of that young lady in the most painful and difficult moment of her life. I'm so grateful for what Marla said here today. It was beautiful, absolutely beautiful, and her own story is a powerful one. The story of a frightened young girl having to make a very tough decision, and in her case, making the right one. And we shouldn't be condemning of those who make a different one. We should reach out to them with the same message of grace and redemption, but never waiver from our message that life is precious.
It's almost impressive the way Huckabee first ridicules and condemns the reasons women might choose an abortion, and then, in the very next breath, insists that these women should not be condemned—and then, in the breath after that, continues to condemn them for making what he considers the ""wrong"" choice. This is what passes for his ""message of grace.""
Now think about if we instill, as we have in this culture of ours, the notion that life is disposable if it represents financial hardships or social disruptions. Here's what we've told the generation coming after us, the generation of my children and now my grandchildren. We've told them that if they were expendable at that end of the spectrum of life because they just were going to be too expensive, or because they represented for us having to mess up our calendars, then we have now told them that at the other end of the spectrum of life, when they become our caretakers, we've already now given them permission. In fact, we have given them full rights to end our lives, because I guarantee you, at that end of the spectrum, we will be a financial hardship to them, and we will represent a social disruption when they have to give up their weekends to come check on us in the long-term care center, and when they have to write the check every month for all of that expensive care that we're going to end up costing.
It's curious, to say the least, that Huckabee is concerned that his children and grandchildren might prefer to off him rather than write out those expensive checks to the nursing home. But if his concern is genuine—which, you can be sure from his laughter, it isn't—he might want to have a conversation with his own Republican Party. It's his party, after all, that is so eager to cut or eliminate entirely the very programs, like Social Security and Medicare and even Meals on Wheels, that would ease the financial burden of caring for Huckabee in his old age. But conservatives don't believe in preserving that social safety net; after all, the government only has an obligation to protect and provide for you while you're still in the womb. After that, you're on your own.
Now, I don't know about you, but I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to make it much tougher for my kids to get rid of me than that. I'm telling you now, I am not going to go easily.
And then the room fills with laughter. Oh, what a wonderful speech. Oh, what a charming man. Oh, what a great voice for a movement that believes it is better to let women die than spend a single government dollar on their health care or the health care of their children once they are born. Toss in some basic shaming of the choices women make, an outrageous comparison to genocide, and voila. There's your ""pro-life"" movement, neatly summed up by one of its most charismatic leaders, because every single life has value, and ""it is not the government who has the right to determine the value of our life or the nature of our death.""
Just remember:
I actually carried out the death penalty 16 times more than any governor in my state's history.

Comedy Central’s Jon Stewart spent last week mocking the GOP for opposing Obamacare, ignoring legitimate concerns Republicans raised about both the health care legislation itself and its bungled launch.
Turns out the funny man did hear the GOP’s complaints.
Stewart interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday’s edition of The Daily Show, and he proceeded to both mock and shred her attempt to talk up Obamacare. One almost could feel sorry for an Obama administration official forced to defend the president’s signature train wreck.
Stewart kept his clown nose on for the start of their chat to highlight Obamacare’s deeply flawed web component.
We’re going to do a challenge,” Stewart said at the start of the interview. “I’m going to try and download every movie ever made, and you are going to try to sign up for Obamacare — and we’ll see which happens first.
Ouch. It was almost as if Jay Leno were sitting in Stewart’s chair for a moment.
Stewart wasn’t finished.
If I’m an individual that doesn’t want [Obamacare], it would be hard for me to look at a big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to,” Stewart said. “Because I would feel like … like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you this year, but you’re not allowing individuals that same courtesy.”
Sebelius ducked the question and repeated her talking points. She did that a few more times on his follow-ups, prompting Stewart to say, “Am I a stupid man?
No, just a comedian who too often defends the president for partisan reasons and mocks the one cable news station–Fox News–which holds Obama’s feet to the fire on the latest headlines.
Sadly, many young Americans say they get their “news” from Stewart’s Daily Show. If true, Millennials got a dose of stone cold reality last night.

After the Supreme Court’s decision labeling Obamacare’s mandate a tax, the IRS has become the crucial centerpiece of President Obama’s health care rollout. But with the IRS’ targeting of conservative non-profits, Republicans are calling into question the agency’s involvement in the application of Obamacare.
On May 23, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) specifically targeted IRS involvement in Obamacare as a rationale for fighting the program:
And here’s another thing we shouldn’t be doing: handing over the administration of Obamacare to these folks. I mean, think about it. A deeply unpopular law being administered by an agency that’s so betrayed the public trust. Even the IRS’ staunchest defenders in this scandal describe their actions as a case of ‘horrible customer service.’ That’s the best they can say: ‘Horrible customer service.’ And now they’re going to be put in charge of a new trillion-dollar program? One that will give them access to all sorts of sensitive, deeply personal information? Well, that’s just what the Administration and congressional Democrats are about to let happen.
McConnell specifically pointed out that the IRS official charged with managing Obamacare was the “very same person who led the division of the IRS now embroiled in scandal – who oversaw the very office now under fire for the discriminatory and harassing behavior.”

McConnell is hardly the only Senator pointing out the nefarious connection between the IRS and Obamacare. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) told Breitbart News, “The president’s entire agenda is based on giving more and more power to the same executive branch agencies that have recently demonstrated themselves to either be criminally incompetent or tyrannically corrupt. Obamacare? Expanded gun background checks? Comprehensive immigration reform? They’re all based on competent collection and ethical use of personal information coerced from the American people by the federal bureaucracy.”
Catherine Frazier, press secretary for Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), agreed: “Everyone should be taken out of the Obamacare business because Obamacare needs to be repealed. The IRS is the very last agency that should be administering any of our laws. Americans have no reason to trust an administration that would engage in, then lie about its partisan, political targeting of Americans based on their personal beliefs.”
“The IRS has acted in this bigoted and un-American a fashion when it was just administering the tax code,” said Ben Sasse, President of Midland University in Nebraska and a person widely perceived to be a possible Senate candidate. “Imagine the range of discrimination possible when it becomes the most important regulatory agency for healthcare, the largest sector of the US economy. Which health offenses become crimes? If a citizen prefers a high-deductible plan, and the bureaucrats object – or if an employer makes paperwork errors – what happens? We are crossing a big threshold here. All defenders of freedom should be in favor of a bright line that prohibits the criminalization of anything related to the purchase of health insurance. The IRS needs to be fixed, not expanded.”
In the House, the opposition is no less pointed. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said to Breitbart News, “The IRS’s future role in ObamaCare is just one of many reasons why this law must be fully repealed. After their outrageous actions and the lack of any accountability – why should any American trust them to involved in their healthcare.”
With a new Gallup poll showing that a full 58 percent of Americans disapprove of the Obama administration’s handling of the IRS scandal, and that 77 percent of Americans think the IRS scandal is either very or somewhat serious, it’s clear that the pushback against Obamacare will center on IRS involvement. And that, in turn, will force President Obama to defend the embattled agency in order to save his flagship program.

Our Johnny-on-the-spot media elite are all over the devilish details of ObamaCare this week. The three-year anniversary of the signing of the bloated government grab is tomorrow, and what better time to point out its massive failures and punitive complications than after it is too late to do anything about it? 
In the media’s defense, some of the failures being reported on now weren’t apparent in 2009 and 2010, but that’s not my complaint. My complaint — and what should be America’s complaint — is where was this kind of scrutiny and reporting when this terrible bill was being gamed through the all-Democrat federal government? 
As we all know, skeptical, forward-looking media analysis of ObamaCare was pretty much non-existent back then. We also know that those who did read the bill and report on its real and potential horrors (through New Media and in Townhall meetings) were demonized by the media. 
Rather than report on the devilish details or laugh Democrats out of office for submitting fraudulent ObamaCare budgets to the CBO so the monstrosity could be called “deficit neutral,” the media instead played State Pipe Organ and focused on all the “goodies.” 
In the meantime, out here in the real world and contrary to all those cotton candy promises the media assured us would come true, insurers facing all kinds of restrictions and a glut of sick people have boosted our health care premiums, and companies everywhere are cutting back employee work hours to avoid being forced to provide insurance. Moreover, contrary to Obama’s biggest promise, people are losing their insurance because companies would prefer to pay the fine than for the Cadillac plans ObamaCare demands. 
And how can one even begin to count the number of individual ObamaCare horror stories that dribble out almost daily, not from the ObamaMedia, naturally — but from conservative media sites like Drudge? We’re about to face a terrifying shortage of physicians and heaven only knows what this means.  
But if you believe in the philosophy of better-late-than-never, Politico actually summoned a little moral courage Friday morning. One of its morning leads takes a fairly in-depth look at how the bill remains unpopular and the massive uphill battle the government faces (money and tech) to get the ObamaCare pieces in place by October, when people are supposed to start signing up. (ObamaCare’s insurance exchanges and most punishing mandates hit early next year.)
Here’s Wednesday’s Wonk Blog at the Washington Post:
Last week I posted a copy of the draft application for Obamacare benefits, which clocks in at a hefty 21 pages. 
Consumer advocates and Wonkblog commenters had similar questions: Why on earth would the federal government create such a complex form to obtain a public benefit? 
You don’t have to spend much time with the chart to get that, it’s really not simple at all.
And Wednesday’s New York Times:
‘Our revenues are about $8 million, but the food business is a low-margin industry so cutting $108,000 out of our profits, which are just over $200,000, is a big deal,’ said Ms. Shein, who is the chief executive. They are evaluating different ways to comply with the new law and finance the expense.
You get my point. But if you don’t, Sean Hannity has a terrific round-up here. 
Over at Investors Business Daily, they’ve come up with “10 Disturbing Facts Americans Have Learned” about ObamaCare over the last three years. 
A better title might have been “10 Disturbing Facts About ObamaCare the Media Are Still Covering Up.” 
Regardless, “disturbing” is a kind word when you’re talking about skyrocketing premium costs, losing your employer-based insurance, having your hours cut back, and nearly a trillion in new tax hikes that will hit the middle class. 
The damage Obama, Democrats, the media, and the Supreme Court have done to this country is impossible to wrap your mind around. How did so many become so corrupted that they gleefully aided and abetted the likely destruction of our most vital and successful institution: the imperfect but still amazing American health care system? 
And God help us; it is just getting started.

165,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/03/Obama-Loses-Two-HHS-Mandate-Cases-in-One-Week,News,Breitbart,Republican,Obama Loses Two HHS Mandate Cases in One Week,"

Obamacare’s HHS Mandate lost yet again in a federal appeals court last Thursday, and then lost in a second case on Friday. These cases continue on the long road to the Supreme Court, and President Obama’s new “accommodation” of religious employers will do nothing to stop them. 
There are now at least 12 HHS Mandate cases in the federal courts of appeals, all challenging Kathleen Sebelius’ deeply-unpopular Obamacare regulation that all employers with 50 or more employees must offer healthcare plans that cover birth control, sterilization, and abortion-related services. 
Grote Industries is an Indiana-based company that makes lighting systems for cars. It’s owned and managed by a family of Roman Catholics who object to birth control. On Jan. 31, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued an injunction pending appeal in Grote Industries v. Sebelius by a 2-1 vote, holding among other things that there is enough of a chance that the HHS Mandate violates federal religious liberty protections that the Chicago-based appeals court is ordering that this company does not need to comply with the regulation. 
The lead lawyer on the case, Matt Bowman from the Alliance Defending Freedom, said: 
Americans have the God-given freedom to live and do business according to their faith. Forcing employers to surrender their faith in order to earn a living is unprecedented, unnecessary, and unconstitutional. Honoring God is important every day, in all areas of life, including in our work. Freedom is not the government’s to give and take away when it pleases.
Then on Feb. 1, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit also issued an injunction pending appeal in Annex Medical, Inc. v. Sebelius. Annex Medical has less than 50 employees, so it’s not required by the Obamacare law to provide healthcare. Nonetheless, the owner offers healthcare to all his employees. 
But the owner of this Minnesota-based company, Stuart Lind, is again a deeply-religious man who objects to the HHS Mandate. So the federal appeals court in St. Louis likewise held that it’s likely the HHS Mandate violates his rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (and possibly the Constitution as well). 
So a dozen such cases are now before different appellate courts, in different stages of appeal. (This doesn’t count dozens more cases that are before the trial-level federal district courts.) Decisions on whether to issue what are called preliminary injunctions in these cases–which will be the next step in the legal process–are likely to start coming down in late spring, meaning that sometime this fall the Supreme Court could vote to take one or more of these cases, and decide the legality of Sebelius’ abortion-related mandate in 2014 once and for all. 
The Obama administration new supposed accommodation for religious employers doesn’t change this equation. Legal experts are still trying to determine if it isn’t just a series of accounting gimmicks. But even if it allowed religious employers to completely opt out of the HHS Mandate, it nonetheless only applies to nonprofit employers. The companies that secured early wins in their cases last week are for-profit, secular businesses. So their cases will continue, and within a year one of the many cases currently on appeal should be before our nation’s highest court.

166,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/13/1193824/-I-Read-Paul-Ryan-s-Budget,News,Dailykos,Democrat,I Read Paul Ryan's Budget,"

Last week, when I talked about ideological bubbles and how to tell if you're in one, I should have mentioned the best single technique for staying out of bubbles in the first place: Expose yourself to as many original sources as you can, especially the ones you know you're going to hate.
With that in mind, I read Paul Ryan's budget yesterday. In telling you about it, I'm going to try to keep my commentary as close to the text as possible, with quotes and page references as appropriate. (I wish I had the time to do an end-to-end annotation, but I've got some big deadlines looming.)
If you think you can stand it, follow me past the squiggle.


General impressions. Before I get into specifics, I want to say a few things about the overall impression the document makes
As many people have already observed, Ryan's proposal is not an attempt to reach a workable compromise with the White House or the Democratic majority in the Senate, both of which would have to agree before his plan could become law. Instead, it's an aspirational document for conservatives: This is what they fantasize about doing if and when they get complete control of the government.
There's nothing wrong with that, but there's also no reason to take it any more seriously than an aspirational budgets from the Left, like People's Budget put out by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Both are shots across the bow, not plausible projections of what the country will do in FY2014 and beyond.
The write-up is a rallying cry for the troops of the conservative movement, not an attempt to convince or convert the non-believers. The summary (page 7) says ""It invites President Obama and Senate Democrats to commit to the same common-sense goal [of a balanced budget in ten years]"" but there is no spirit-of-invitation in Ryan's style. Any liberal who reads it will get pissed off, and I believe that's intentional. Conservatives couldn't fully enjoy their reading experience without visualizing pissed-off liberals.
Let me detail that: You've probably already heard that Ryan wants (once again) to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. ObamaCare). But after the first mention, he can't just call the law by name, or even nickname. It's ""the President's onerous health care law"" (page 33) or ""the President's misguided health care law"" (page 40) and so on, as if the ACA had been imposed on the country by imperial decree and Congress had nothing to say about it -- also as if the ACA hadn't been an issue in the 2012 election that Romney/Ryan lost by nearly five million votes.
Other partisan stuff is just silly. On page 24, President Reagan is given credit both for the economic expansion of his era, and of President Clinton's era as well. Clinton is mentioned exactly once, on page 33, when Ryan re-raises the universally debunked lie from campaign 2012 that Obama wants to rescind the work requirement of Clinton's welfare reform. The reader would never know that Ryan's stated goal -- a balanced budget -- was achieved by Clinton while Reagan ran up record deficits.
You will also hear echoes of 2009's Lie of the Year: death panels. The ACA sets up an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make annual recommendations on keeping Medicare spending within specified limits. The law specifically bans the IPAB from recommending care-rationing, but the heading of the Ryan's section on it (page 40) is ""Repeal the health-care rationing board"".
Background assumptions. In the real world, if a program is important enough, the government could conceivably raise taxes or borrow to pay for it. OK, Ryan's balanced-budget goal won't let him advocate borrowing. But a fundamental assumption that runs through his whole budget -- usually without being stated explicitly -- is that taxes cannot be raised for any purpose. Nothing is important enough to raise taxes to pay for.
Also, defense spending is untouchable. ""There is no foreseeable ‘peace dividend’ on our horizon."" (page 61)
So if the domestic demands on government are growing -- the population is getting older, the infrastructure more decrepit, healthcare more expensive, weather-related disasters more extreme and more frequent, future economic growth more dependent basic research and an educated workforce etc. -- any money you want to spend to deal with one of those challenges has to be taken from the others.
The idea that over the long term our country could decide that it wants to do more of its consumption publicly -- that it wants to take economic growth in the form of Medicare and public education, say, rather than BMWs -- that's completely off the table.
Big Picture. The numbers don't appear until the Appendix (page 80). Atlantic's Derek Thompson put the ten-year cut totals into a bar graph and a pie chart.
Social Security: $0
Defense: $0
Medicare: $129 billion
Discretionary: $249 billion
Interest: $700 billion
Medicaid/other health: $756 billion
Mandatory spending: $962 billion
Obamacare: $1.837 trillion
Medicare and Social Security are usually considered ""mandatory spending"" (because benefits are defined by law rather than by appropriation), but I believe the additional $962 billion of 10-year savings is Food Stamps, Pell grants, and a variety of other people-helping programs.
So the cuts are almost entirely in healthcare, education, or anti-poverty spending.
Meanwhile, rich people get a big bonanza: The top tax rate drops from the current 39.6% to 25%. If you make $10 million some year (some CEOs do), that could save you nearly $1.5 million.
It's also worthwhile to consider what isn't in the budget document.

Any specifics about discretionary spending cuts. The cuts are just numbers on a spreadsheet. All the ""tough choices"" necessary to achieve those numbers are left to your imagination, so Ryan can deny any intention to cut anything in particular, as Mitt Romney did in his first debate with President Obama.
Any specifics about closing tax loopholes. Ryan claims his rich-guys-bonanza 25% tax rate wouldn't cut federal revenue, because it would be balanced by eliminating tax loopholes. As in the 2012 campaign, Ryan says nothing about what those loopholes might be. Again, he can deny wanting to cut any specific item, like the mortgage interest deduction. But he's got to raise that revenue somehow, and I seriously doubt it's all going to come from the super-rich who benefit most from the lower rate.
Any plan for Social Security. Page 37 charges: ""In Social Security, government’s refusal to deal with demographic realities has endangered the solvency of this critical program."" But rather than ""deal with demographic realities"" here and now, Ryan only ""requires the President and Congress to work together to forge a solution.""

We have always been at war with Eurasia. The background rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul assumption allows Ryan to construct some truly Orwellian statements. This is particularly true in the ""Opportunity Extended"" section, which is all about shrinking opportunity for poor and working-class young people.
For example, on page 20 Ryan identifies ""tuition inflation"" as a problem that ""plung[es] students and their families into unaffordable levels of debt"". And then he says:
Many economists, including Ohio University’s Richard Vedder*, argue that the structure of the federal government’s aid programs don’t simply chase higher tuition costs, but are in fact a key driver of those costs.
What could that possibly mean? Well, that federal aid is allowing too many people to go to college, creating a high-demand environment in which colleges can raise tuition. So the ""solution"" is to lower the maximum Pell grant (thereby ""saving"" the Pell grant program from spending at an ""unsustainable"" level, since we couldn't possibly raise taxes to pay for it). Also to ""target aid to the truly needy"" by making families report more of their income on financial aid forms. Also ""reforming"" student loans and ""re-examining the data made available to students to make certain they are armed with information that will assist them in making their postsecondary decisions"".
Presumably, when the facts of this harsher you're-on-your-own world are spelled out to students, fewer of them will decide to go to college, thereby saving both their money and the government's. So don't worry about student debt -- just don't go to college at all if you're not rich, and if you do go we'll ""help"" you avoid massive debts by refusing to loan you money.
Oh, and we'll also ""encourage innovation"" through ""nontraditional models like online coursework"". Never mind that's where the big scams are. Corporations profit from those scams, so that's not ""waste"".
Ditto for job training: Ryan promises to ""extend opportunity"" by spending less on it.
Ditto for the safety net. Since taxes can't possibly be raised, every person who is helped by the safety net is taking those dollars away from somebody else who might be helped. So Ryan's ""A Safety Net Strengthened"" section is all about spending less on the safety net. Mostly this is accomplished by block-granting programs like Medicaid to give ""states more flexibility to tailor programs to their people’s needs.""
So if, say, low-income Texans need to toughen up and stop seeing a doctor at all, Texas can tailor its program that way. That's what it's doing already with the ""flexibility"" the Supreme Court gave it last summer.
Energy. Climate change just isn't happening. Ryan doesn't say that in so many words, but there's a big empty spot where that idea would be.
He clumps energy together with a grab-bag of other issues in the ""Fairness Restored"" section. The ""unfairness"" in this case is the way that the Obama administration favors clean energy over dirty energy. Ryan will ""end kickbacks to favored industries"" like wind and solar in favor of ""reliable, low-cost energy"" like coal, oil, and gas. With climate change out of the picture, only corruption can explain Obama's favoritism. In his Introduction -- signed ""Paul"" -- Ryan says his budget ""restores fair play to the marketplace by ending cronyism.""
In current energy policy, fossil fuels and green energy are subsidized in different ways: Green energy gets grants and loans while established-and-profitable fossil energy gets tax breaks. Tax breaks are invisible to Ryan, so he can say on page 50:
on a dollar-per-unit-of-production basis, the level of subsidies received by the wind and solar industries were almost 100 times greater than those for conventional energy
Do it for the kids. So what's the purpose of all this? A better world for our children. ""By living beyond our means, we're stealing from the next generation."" (page 5)
Of course you know how that works, because all that debt America ran up during World War II was ""stolen"" from us, right?
Or maybe you didn't notice, because in the real America, the big deficits of World War II kicked off half a century of prosperity, during which the country achieved a level of equality that it hasn't equalled before or since. So no, deficits are not ""stolen"" from the future. We're not building landing crafts and putting them in time machines to send them back to D-Day.
But in order to save our children from the horrible maybe-sorta-problem of the national debt, we need to under-educate them; not do basic research that might create the next Internet; leave them crumbling roads, bridges, and electrical grids; not care for them when they get sick; move in with them when we get old; and leave them with a torched planet, where Iowa is a desert and Miami is underwater.
I'm sure they'll thank us for our foresight.

* As best I can tell, although Ryan identifies only their university affiliations, every economist Ryan mentions by name is inside the conservative bubble. Richard Vedder is with the American Enterprise Institute and John Taylor with the Hoover Institute.

President Obama is going to try to flip the idea of his Grand Bargain with a new trade of taxes for jobs. But that doesn't mean Grand Bargain 1.0, entitlement cuts for taxes, isn't still proceeding on a separate track. It is. The bullshit caucus, the Republican senators who went around leader Mitch McConnell to broker a filibuster deal with Harry Reid, are still being wooed by senior administration staff, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, and it still puts Medicare and Social Security on the chopping block.
The talks are aimed at averting a partial government shutdown this fall that would result if the two parties can't agree on federal spending levels for the next fiscal year, as now seems likely, or strike a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Treasury SecretaryJacob Lew, appearing in a series of Sunday television interviews, predicted the U.S. would likely hit its statutory borrowing limit, now $16.7 trillion, sometime after Labor Day. If lawmakers fail to lift the cap, the U.S. will be unable to borrow money to pay all its bills. [...]
Republicans, for their part, in the talks have suggested changes to Medicare, including switching to a slower-growing gauge of inflation that would reduce benefits, and ""means-testing"" the program by charging well-to-do senior citizens higher premiums. In the past, Mr. Obama has said he could consider both ideas as part of a larger deal. Republicans also proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare, a concept the White House dislikes. [...]
The meetings have been relatively informal, with Republicans offering ideas for where to find budget savings which, if implemented, could diminish the across-the-board cuts to the budget. Republicans have made clear they won't accept raising new tax revenues to erase the sequester, a Senate GOP aide said. [...]
Mr. Lew said on Sunday the White House wants to replace the sequester with a combination of changes to entitlement programs and adjustments to the tax code—often code for raising revenue by eliminating tax breaks.

Great. Republicans have ruled out new tax revenue and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough ""and other senior aides"" are still meeting with them, still offering up benefits cuts from Medicare and Social Security [the ""slower-growing gauge of inflation"" would be the chained CPI for Social Security, not Medicare as the story suggests]. Once upon a time, President Obama promised no entitlement cuts unless he got revenue. And yet, here we still are with benefit cuts on the table and no new taxes on the table. Now he's negotiating for adjustments to the tax code, which Republicans will probably insist on making revenue neutral.
With his latest pivot to the economy, and a renewed focus on income inequality and the middle class and jobs, the last thing President Obama should be doing is offering up these programs—which are so vital to the income security of the majority of seniors—for cuts. Especially when he's making the offer to Republicans who are as intractable on revenue as ever.

We've talked a lot lately about how rough the GOP is having it of late. But in case you want to see what that looks like in the polling composite, it's as glorious as you might imagine:

Democrats need to win the popular vote in 2014 by about seven points to take the House. So far, so good. It's early, obviously, but who doesn't like those trends? And it's not as if the GOP is doing the things it needs to do to reverse them. As legendary pollster Andrew Kohut (founder of Pew and president of Gallup when they were good) notes:
In my decades of polling, I recall only one moment when a party had been driven as far from the center as the Republican Party has been today [...]
I see little reason to believe that the staunch conservative bloc will wither away or splinter; it will remain a dominant force in the GOP and on the national stage. At the same time, however, I see no indication that its ideas about policy, governance and social issues will gain new adherents. They are far beyond the mainstream.

The GOP's dilemma is obvious: evolve now, and risk a massive backlash among its base, rendering it unelectable for along freakin' time. Don't evolve, and remain far from the American mainstream, rendering it unelectable forever. It's a lose-lose situation, which in all truth, is everything the GOP deserves.

Fox News Nation strikes again.



Fox News Nation strikes again.

Sean Hannity has been following the Ted Cruz ""Obamacare is ruining all our lives"" on his Fox show, reinforcing the baseless belief in most Fox viewers that the law is somehow going to throw them to the health insurance wolves. That's despite the fact that the Fox demographic is pretty much all on Medicare. But Fox exists to reinforce Republican lies, so that's what they've been doing. Salon's Eric Stern happened to catch Hannity in the act, featuring four couples who swore they had been hurt by Obamacare, and decided to do a little fact checking. Debunking Hannity turned out to be ""appallingly easy"" for Stern when he conducted follow up interviews Hannity's guests.
First up was Paul Cox of Leicester, North Carolina, and his wife Michelle. They told Hannity that they have had to cut the hours of their employees in their construction business because they couldn't afford to insure them.
Obamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? “Well,” he said, “I haven’t been forced to do so, it’s just that I’ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.” What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he’d call me back. He never did.
Actually, Cox could be getting a tax credit under Obamacare to help provide insurance to his four employees. I think he probably doesn't care as much about his employees' well-being as he wanted the Fox audience to believe. The only requirement for Cox under the law is that he informs his employees of the existence of the new health insurance exchange.
Then there's Allison Denijs who told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums and just got a letter from Blue Cross saying that her current policy wasn't in compliance with the law, so it was being discontinued and replaced. She also has a daughter with a pre-existing condition who hasn't been covered. She's angry because Obama promised that we could keep our existing policies. Stern asked if she'd actually checked out the exchange. She hadn't. Stern found ""that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.""
Not a bad deal. Likewise, Stern found a pretty good deal on the exchange for the final couple, Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin, Tennessee. They're mad because their kids are grown, but they have to have a policy that covers things they don't want like maternity care, pediatric care, prenatal care and so forth. Welcome to health insurance, Robbie and Tina. They're also mad because their insurance agent told them they would have to pay 50-75 percent more for a plan compliant with the law.
Had they shopped on the exchange yet, I asked? No, Tina said, nor would they. They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it. Fair enough, but they should know that I found a plan for them for, at most, $3,700 a year, a 63 percent less than their current bill.
Robbie and Tina need a new insurance agent. The thing for these people who are so mad that their current insurance policies are being discontinued is that they're being replaced with insurance plans that actually cover stuff. That's going to mean bigger premiums for some people, but what Hannity and all right-wing pundits and politicians leave out is that the majority of these people won't have to pay the full bill for those premiums. What Hannity-types are also not admitting is that this is a pretty tiny group of Americans, those who buy their insurance in the individual market and who were already insured. So is Obamacare hurting all Americans? Of course not, just the teeny-tiny bunch of die-hard conservatives who will refuse to be helped.

170,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/13/1193824/-I-Read-Paul-Ryan-s-Budget,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,I Read Paul Ryan's Budget,"

Last week, when I talked about ideological bubbles and how to tell if you're in one, I should have mentioned the best single technique for staying out of bubbles in the first place: Expose yourself to as many original sources as you can, especially the ones you know you're going to hate.
With that in mind, I read Paul Ryan's budget yesterday. In telling you about it, I'm going to try to keep my commentary as close to the text as possible, with quotes and page references as appropriate. (I wish I had the time to do an end-to-end annotation, but I've got some big deadlines looming.)
If you think you can stand it, follow me past the squiggle.


General impressions. Before I get into specifics, I want to say a few things about the overall impression the document makes
As many people have already observed, Ryan's proposal is not an attempt to reach a workable compromise with the White House or the Democratic majority in the Senate, both of which would have to agree before his plan could become law. Instead, it's an aspirational document for conservatives: This is what they fantasize about doing if and when they get complete control of the government.
There's nothing wrong with that, but there's also no reason to take it any more seriously than an aspirational budgets from the Left, like People's Budget put out by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Both are shots across the bow, not plausible projections of what the country will do in FY2014 and beyond.
The write-up is a rallying cry for the troops of the conservative movement, not an attempt to convince or convert the non-believers. The summary (page 7) says ""It invites President Obama and Senate Democrats to commit to the same common-sense goal [of a balanced budget in ten years]"" but there is no spirit-of-invitation in Ryan's style. Any liberal who reads it will get pissed off, and I believe that's intentional. Conservatives couldn't fully enjoy their reading experience without visualizing pissed-off liberals.
Let me detail that: You've probably already heard that Ryan wants (once again) to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. ObamaCare). But after the first mention, he can't just call the law by name, or even nickname. It's ""the President's onerous health care law"" (page 33) or ""the President's misguided health care law"" (page 40) and so on, as if the ACA had been imposed on the country by imperial decree and Congress had nothing to say about it -- also as if the ACA hadn't been an issue in the 2012 election that Romney/Ryan lost by nearly five million votes.
Other partisan stuff is just silly. On page 24, President Reagan is given credit both for the economic expansion of his era, and of President Clinton's era as well. Clinton is mentioned exactly once, on page 33, when Ryan re-raises the universally debunked lie from campaign 2012 that Obama wants to rescind the work requirement of Clinton's welfare reform. The reader would never know that Ryan's stated goal -- a balanced budget -- was achieved by Clinton while Reagan ran up record deficits.
You will also hear echoes of 2009's Lie of the Year: death panels. The ACA sets up an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) to make annual recommendations on keeping Medicare spending within specified limits. The law specifically bans the IPAB from recommending care-rationing, but the heading of the Ryan's section on it (page 40) is ""Repeal the health-care rationing board"".
Background assumptions. In the real world, if a program is important enough, the government could conceivably raise taxes or borrow to pay for it. OK, Ryan's balanced-budget goal won't let him advocate borrowing. But a fundamental assumption that runs through his whole budget -- usually without being stated explicitly -- is that taxes cannot be raised for any purpose. Nothing is important enough to raise taxes to pay for.
Also, defense spending is untouchable. ""There is no foreseeable ‘peace dividend’ on our horizon."" (page 61)
So if the domestic demands on government are growing -- the population is getting older, the infrastructure more decrepit, healthcare more expensive, weather-related disasters more extreme and more frequent, future economic growth more dependent basic research and an educated workforce etc. -- any money you want to spend to deal with one of those challenges has to be taken from the others.
The idea that over the long term our country could decide that it wants to do more of its consumption publicly -- that it wants to take economic growth in the form of Medicare and public education, say, rather than BMWs -- that's completely off the table.
Big Picture. The numbers don't appear until the Appendix (page 80). Atlantic's Derek Thompson put the ten-year cut totals into a bar graph and a pie chart.
Social Security: $0
Defense: $0
Medicare: $129 billion
Discretionary: $249 billion
Interest: $700 billion
Medicaid/other health: $756 billion
Mandatory spending: $962 billion
Obamacare: $1.837 trillion
Medicare and Social Security are usually considered ""mandatory spending"" (because benefits are defined by law rather than by appropriation), but I believe the additional $962 billion of 10-year savings is Food Stamps, Pell grants, and a variety of other people-helping programs.
So the cuts are almost entirely in healthcare, education, or anti-poverty spending.
Meanwhile, rich people get a big bonanza: The top tax rate drops from the current 39.6% to 25%. If you make $10 million some year (some CEOs do), that could save you nearly $1.5 million.
It's also worthwhile to consider what isn't in the budget document.

Any specifics about discretionary spending cuts. The cuts are just numbers on a spreadsheet. All the ""tough choices"" necessary to achieve those numbers are left to your imagination, so Ryan can deny any intention to cut anything in particular, as Mitt Romney did in his first debate with President Obama.
Any specifics about closing tax loopholes. Ryan claims his rich-guys-bonanza 25% tax rate wouldn't cut federal revenue, because it would be balanced by eliminating tax loopholes. As in the 2012 campaign, Ryan says nothing about what those loopholes might be. Again, he can deny wanting to cut any specific item, like the mortgage interest deduction. But he's got to raise that revenue somehow, and I seriously doubt it's all going to come from the super-rich who benefit most from the lower rate.
Any plan for Social Security. Page 37 charges: ""In Social Security, government’s refusal to deal with demographic realities has endangered the solvency of this critical program."" But rather than ""deal with demographic realities"" here and now, Ryan only ""requires the President and Congress to work together to forge a solution.""

We have always been at war with Eurasia. The background rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul assumption allows Ryan to construct some truly Orwellian statements. This is particularly true in the ""Opportunity Extended"" section, which is all about shrinking opportunity for poor and working-class young people.
For example, on page 20 Ryan identifies ""tuition inflation"" as a problem that ""plung[es] students and their families into unaffordable levels of debt"". And then he says:
Many economists, including Ohio University’s Richard Vedder*, argue that the structure of the federal government’s aid programs don’t simply chase higher tuition costs, but are in fact a key driver of those costs.
What could that possibly mean? Well, that federal aid is allowing too many people to go to college, creating a high-demand environment in which colleges can raise tuition. So the ""solution"" is to lower the maximum Pell grant (thereby ""saving"" the Pell grant program from spending at an ""unsustainable"" level, since we couldn't possibly raise taxes to pay for it). Also to ""target aid to the truly needy"" by making families report more of their income on financial aid forms. Also ""reforming"" student loans and ""re-examining the data made available to students to make certain they are armed with information that will assist them in making their postsecondary decisions"".
Presumably, when the facts of this harsher you're-on-your-own world are spelled out to students, fewer of them will decide to go to college, thereby saving both their money and the government's. So don't worry about student debt -- just don't go to college at all if you're not rich, and if you do go we'll ""help"" you avoid massive debts by refusing to loan you money.
Oh, and we'll also ""encourage innovation"" through ""nontraditional models like online coursework"". Never mind that's where the big scams are. Corporations profit from those scams, so that's not ""waste"".
Ditto for job training: Ryan promises to ""extend opportunity"" by spending less on it.
Ditto for the safety net. Since taxes can't possibly be raised, every person who is helped by the safety net is taking those dollars away from somebody else who might be helped. So Ryan's ""A Safety Net Strengthened"" section is all about spending less on the safety net. Mostly this is accomplished by block-granting programs like Medicaid to give ""states more flexibility to tailor programs to their people’s needs.""
So if, say, low-income Texans need to toughen up and stop seeing a doctor at all, Texas can tailor its program that way. That's what it's doing already with the ""flexibility"" the Supreme Court gave it last summer.
Energy. Climate change just isn't happening. Ryan doesn't say that in so many words, but there's a big empty spot where that idea would be.
He clumps energy together with a grab-bag of other issues in the ""Fairness Restored"" section. The ""unfairness"" in this case is the way that the Obama administration favors clean energy over dirty energy. Ryan will ""end kickbacks to favored industries"" like wind and solar in favor of ""reliable, low-cost energy"" like coal, oil, and gas. With climate change out of the picture, only corruption can explain Obama's favoritism. In his Introduction -- signed ""Paul"" -- Ryan says his budget ""restores fair play to the marketplace by ending cronyism.""
In current energy policy, fossil fuels and green energy are subsidized in different ways: Green energy gets grants and loans while established-and-profitable fossil energy gets tax breaks. Tax breaks are invisible to Ryan, so he can say on page 50:
on a dollar-per-unit-of-production basis, the level of subsidies received by the wind and solar industries were almost 100 times greater than those for conventional energy
Do it for the kids. So what's the purpose of all this? A better world for our children. ""By living beyond our means, we're stealing from the next generation."" (page 5)
Of course you know how that works, because all that debt America ran up during World War II was ""stolen"" from us, right?
Or maybe you didn't notice, because in the real America, the big deficits of World War II kicked off half a century of prosperity, during which the country achieved a level of equality that it hasn't equalled before or since. So no, deficits are not ""stolen"" from the future. We're not building landing crafts and putting them in time machines to send them back to D-Day.
But in order to save our children from the horrible maybe-sorta-problem of the national debt, we need to under-educate them; not do basic research that might create the next Internet; leave them crumbling roads, bridges, and electrical grids; not care for them when they get sick; move in with them when we get old; and leave them with a torched planet, where Iowa is a desert and Miami is underwater.
I'm sure they'll thank us for our foresight.

* As best I can tell, although Ryan identifies only their university affiliations, every economist Ryan mentions by name is inside the conservative bubble. Richard Vedder is with the American Enterprise Institute and John Taylor with the Hoover Institute.

171,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/03/polls-show-wave-buolding-against-senate-democrats,News,Breitbart,Republican,Polls Show ObamaCare Wave Building Against Senate Democrats,"
Recent polling shows that an election wave of anti-ObamaCare sentiment is growing, and it is not only likely to hand the GOP control of the United States Senate, but might wipe out as many as 12 Democrat seats–many of which looked safe just a few months ago. 
Back in July, Five Thirty Eight’s election guru Nate Silver believed that control of the Senate was a tossup. That has all changed now that voters got their first real look at the brutal consequences of ObamaCare.
Starting with the generic ballot that simply pits Republican lawmakers against their Democrat counterparts, the movement towards the GOP has been striking. In the Real Clear Politics average of these polls, going back as far as the beginning of the year, Democrats have consistently led by 3 to 4 points. During the government shutdown, Democrats leaped to 6 and 7 point leads. Since the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, though, Republicans are not only in the lead by 2.5 points; they have led in every poll but one since November 10. 
This generic polling is reflected in the available polling of individual Senate seats. 
Keep in mind that in order to win control of the Senate, Republicans need only pick up six seats, and with Democrat incumbents retiring in the redder than red states of South Dakota, West Virginia, and Montana, Republicans pretty much have three Senate pick-ups in the bag. But thanks to ObamaCare and vulnerable Democrat Senators refusing to put their own promises and the wellbeing of their constituents above slavish devotion to Obama, picking off another three should be fairly easy. 
 
Kay Hagan (D-NC)
In North Carolina, Democrat Kay Hagan looked as though she was cruising to a second term victory. Just a few months ago, polls showed her ahead by double digits against her most likely Republican challengers. 
In September, before ObamaCare started cancelling people’s policies by the millions and boosting the price of their premiums, Hagan was beating potential challenger Greg Bannon by a whopping 16 points. In the most recent poll taken just a couple weeks ago, Bannon picked up an astonishing 17 points and is now ahead by 1. 
All of Hagan’s most likely Republican challengers made similar gains. 
There is a YouTube video of Hagan promising that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance if you like it. Obviously that is not true, which means she either lied or blindly voted for something without understanding the consequences for her constituents.
 
Mary Landrieu (D-LA)
Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has seen her approval rating collapse by double digits in just six months. Three months ago, Landrieu looked as though she would coast to a fourth term in a state Mitt Romney won without breaking a sweat. The National Journal now lists Landrieu as the third most endangered incumbent facing re-election in 2014. 
In August, Landrieu was polling over 50% in potential match ups (which would avoid a Louisiana runoff that requires the eventual winner hit at least 50%) and beating Republican Congressman Bill Cassidy, her most likely opponent, by a full 10 points. The consequences of ObamaCare have completely flipped that script. 
A recent poll shows the relatively unknown Cassidy behind by only 2 points
There is YouTube video of Landrieu promising her constituents that under ObamaCare, you can keep your insurance. The facts have either proved Landrieu a liar or incompetent. Other than token legislation to keep that promise, Landrieu has been as devoted to Obama and ObamaCare as any liberal Democrat. 
 
Mark Pryor (D-AR)
Thanks to ObamaCare, Senator Mark Pryor’s approval ratings in Arkansas have collapsed to just 33%, the lowest of his 12 years in the Senate. When Democrat Arkansas incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln lost her seat in 2010, her approval ratings were actually higher. The National Journal ranks Pryor as the most vulnerable Senate incumbent facing reelection in 2014. 
Pryor is also on record misleading his constituents about ObamaCare. 
 
Mark Begich (D-AK)
Just before the disastrous ObamaCare rollout, Alaskan Senator Mark Begich was cruising to reelection by as much as 11 points. Post-ObamaCare polls show that Begich has been considerably weakened and is ahead by only a point or two against his likely Republican challengers. Moreover, Begich’s approval rating among Alaskans now sits at a measly 39%. 
Begich is on record misleading his constituents with false assurances that under ObamaCare you can keep your insurance. The GOP is already pounding him over that. 
Other than token proposals, Begich has done absolutely nothing to either keep that promise or to mitigate the damage ObamaCare is doing to Alaskans. 
The National Journal lists Begich as the second most vulnerable incumbent in the Senate. 
 
Iowa – Open Democrat Seat
With longtime Democrat Tom Harkin retiring from the Senate, Democrats thought they had made this seat safe with the recruitment of Rep. Bruce Braley. Until the American people were rattled by the consequences of ObamaCare, Democrats were probably right. In matchup after matchup, Braley was ahead by double digits. 
Post-ObamaCare, that lead has shrunk to single digits. 
 
Mark Udall (D-CO)
Prior to the ObamaCare rollout, Udall wasn’t even on the National Journal‘s list of endangered incumbents. Millions of insurance cancellations later, however, and the Democrat has a real fight on his hands. In one likely match up, Udall’s 15 point lead back in June has dropped to just 3 points. 
—

Since the ObamaCare fallout, the National Journal has added Al Franken (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) to its 2014 endangered list. Prior to the country being hit upside the head with the reality of ObamaCare, the idea that any one of these incumbents had anything to worry about was unthinkable. 
Shaheen is vulnerable enough that former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is considering a challenge. Polls show her under 50% at 48% and Brown only behind by 4%. He hasn’t even made it official and is already within the margin of error. And if he runs, it will be on the issue of ObamaCare. 
Many believe that the worst of ObamaCare has yet to show itself. As the 2014 midterm elections loom closer late next year, so will the employer mandate. The Obama Administration itself has predicted that the fallout from the employer mandate could be tens of millions of cancellations. 
Knowing this is coming, and unless something changes, these vulnerable Democrats are likely to be remembered only as having done nothing to avoid catastrophes mainly afflicting the working and middle class. 
That is, other than hold hands with Obama to watch it all burn.

172,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/30/ben-sasse-nebraska-obamacare,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Emergent Anti-Obamacare Senate Candidate Breaks Fundraising Record in Nebraska,"
A novice Republican running in a rural state has shattered fundraising records campaigning as the “anti-Obamacare candidate.” In his first race for public office, Ben Sasse has raised nearly $750,000 in just eight weeks of the first quarter of his nascent candidacy, according to records being filed with the Federal Election Commission.
The massive haul highlights how lucrative campaigning against Obamacare can be for Republicans. It also underscores how deeply motivated conservative voters are to see that the sprawling healthcare law be killed.
A college president in his hometown of Fremont, Nebraska, Sasse is a newcomer to politics, but he has spent much of the past decade working on healthcare issues. As a top advisor to President Bush’s Health Secretary, Sasse worked to cut red tape and pushed market-based solutions over government mandates. Sasse also spent several years traveling the country giving speeches and advising companies about the dangers of Obamacare and how it will hike costs, constrict innovation, and ultimately provide terrible health care.
“I am the anti-Obamacare candidate,” Sasse said cheerfully. “Not only have I read the 2,300-page bill, I have actually spent years studying it and I understand just how devastating this will be to American businesses, families and taxpayers.”
It was Sasse’s health care expertise and his outspoken opposition to Obamacare that inspired former Nebraska GOP chairman Mark Fahleson to draft Sasse to run for the open seat left by Sen. Mike Johann’s retirement.
“2014 and probably 2016 will be about one thing more than anything else,” Fahleson said. “It will be about Obamacare and the false promises and reckless entitlement spending that are set to destroy this country. And I don’t know anybody who knows more about it and is more honest about the problems of Obamacare than Ben.”
Sasse’s campaign comes just as the crusade against Obamacare has hit a fevered pitch in Washington.
“Ted Cruz has finally shown the Republican establishment in Washington just how fed up voters are with the federal government and the notion that bureaucrats know what is best for patients,” said one political consultant who advised the Cruz campaign. “That’s why a guy knowledgeable about healthcare like Ben Sasse being in the Senate would be the most destructive thing to ever hit Obamacare.”
Sasse’s cash haul of nearly $750,000 from individual donors in his first quarter breaks Nebraska’s previous record of $526,000 from individual donors, set in 2007 by Johanns while he was sitting U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.
Shane Osborn, former state treasurer who has been running for the senate seat for six months, raised just $234,000 in his first quarter, according to FEC records.

The ACA. That's right. The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, actually represents a once in a generation opportunity for Democrats in red states in 2014. But we'e got to get on top of this NOW. Together.
UPDATE: Thank you all for your words of encouragement, for sharing this diary with your networks and for the financial support. Today I secured the Domain SabotageStates.com and I'm going to talk with a colleague about setting up the backend for us.
Additionally, we're going to be moving forward with these videos and graphics. I hope to have the first of them for you to examine next week. Excited!!!!
Together, we can!



First of all, look at this map.

It shows which states are participating in the Obamacare and which have opted out. The red and purple states aren't any surprise.
But I'll bet this will be:

This is a study conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies that interviewed 2500 residents in the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina - some the most ""southern"" and ""conservative"" states in the country.
But a poll conducted in March and April by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found that 62 percent of the people in those states support the expansion, one of the key instruments in the Obama administration’s strategy to reduce the number of uninsured Americans.

This is an opportunity for Democrats to get ahead on this issue in states where people will see changes in coverage and where the GOP will continue to try to blame Obama and the Democratic health reform initiative. We can fight back.
Bold Blue Media Alliance has formed a coalition with several other groups and individuals in these states, including some state-level and county-level Democratic officials. We are prepared to create 60-second and 30-second television, radio ads and internet videos for their use as well as print-ready materials - to help our party get the TRUTH out; that the GOP in these states hates Obama more than they care about health and the lives of their own constituents. They are sabotaging the health care law and costing people their lives. They are saboteurs and I call these states are Sabotage States.
We plan to create clear, targeted, easy-to-understand (and hard to refute) messages for each state with numbers and information people can actually relate to. We plan, as is our Mission at Bold Blue Media, to give Democrats and Progressives at the state and local levels the tools they need to fight back and win.
It's time to empower Team Blue no matter where they are in the country. I believe that the proper framing of this issue can aid 2014 party recruitment in these tough-to-win states and localities and that we can force an open debate about the real motivations of the Republican party in states where they have been blindly followed for too long. It's time for us to rally 'round our side in these tough states where they often feel all is futile.
Open enrollment for ACA starts in October. There are 21 states that will need this media. We'd like to have the videos and infographics available to them by late July. I need your help.
HOW CAN YOU HELP?
ONE WAY:
If you have any connection with your state or local Democratic party, particularly if you live in one of the Sabotage States, please message me here or email me at m.paige at bold blue media dot com.
ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:
Like this page, share it on twitter or facebook; Especially if you have friends or followers from Sabotage States. They need to know we're all fighting for their access to health care. That we are one in the fight to make it available to EVERY American and that we won't stop until they have the same access as those participating states.
ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:
You can help by subscribing to Bold Blue Magazine. No, seriously. I can't make all these videos and infographics on my own in time. I'm busy planning our Netroots Nation booth and creating the premier issue of Bold Blue Magazine. But I feel this issue is so important and that we have a limited window of time in which to act. Although I plan to do the groundwork on the videos by laying the basic structure for them, I'll need to engage our Alliance Team Network, many of whom are Kossacks, to help complete this monumental task in time by adding state-specific imagery and information to the media. We haven't enough revenue coming in yet for me to pay them properly at this time, but I have to offer them at least something. Your subscription would help me to that and help us meet the deadline.
I know many state and county parties, particularly in these red states, are strapped. I'm presently building a partnership with a major progressive organization here in DC. I'm hoping that by the end of July they can help facilitate fundraising for media buys and work with Sabotage State Democrats to educate, expose and put pressure on recalcitrant republican state legislators.
Subscribe here. It would help a lot. PLUS, hell. You'll get a GREAT magazine in the process! (I have to tell you, I'm putting together the premier issue and it's going to be amazing!). You can choose your subscription rate. If you manage $3/month, we'd love that. There are options all the way up to $100/month (for those of you who want to treat this more like state/local campaign support). There's even some special pricing that will disappear on June 1st so take advantage of it now, while you can.
This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make progress in tough states. Let's do it.
UPDATE: Iowa has decided to go WITH the expansion. 150,000 Iowans will benefit. Imagine that. This sh*t is not hard. Really. It's not.

With ObamaCare revealing that except for lies and incompetence Emperor Obama is naked, all around the country voters are turning against the president’s political party and anyone who made it possible for ObamaCare to rape the middle class. Just a few months ago, the media thought the government shutdown would benefit Democrats in the 2014 midterms. Today the National Journal reports that a wave is building that will hand Republicans control of the United States Senate.
A third of America’s one-hundred U.S. Senators are up for re-election every two years. Of the 33 or 34 facing a 2014 election, the National Journal identifies 15 seats as vulnerable. Thirteen of those seats are held by Democrats. But of the 7 seats most likely to turn over, all 7 are held by Democrats. Republicans need only pick up 6 seats to win the chamber. 
Unlike the shutdown, ObamaCare is almost certain to be the gift that keeps on giving to Republicans as the law rains hell on American voters. By the government’s own calculations, tens of millions more insurance cancellations are expected to hit next year. And if the Administration does get the website functional, that only means that Americans will discover the other bad news about lost doctors, premium increases, and sky-high  deductibles.
The unprecedented — over 225 years — move by Senate Democrats to kill the filibuster for presidential appointees is also a sign that Democrats see the writing on the wall. With only a year of majority control left, and ObamaCare dying a death of a thousand cuts, the nuclear option was the only move Obama had left to secure some kind of legacy by packing the courts and various regulatory agencies. 
In other news, talk of Democrats regaining control of the House was never a very real possibility and is now a distant memory. 
The good news for Republicans is that with control of both chambers, they will have two years to show the American people that they are far from obstructionists and do-nothings. John Boehner’s House has passed a number of bills, but the media refuse to report that fact and Democrat Harry Reid refuses to even allow them to come up for a vote in the Senate. 
With Reid out of the picture, Republicans can craft a real agenda with real alternatives to Obama’s relentless, failed statism. 
If this opportunity is handled well (always a long shot with the GOP), it could help the party heading into 2016.

175,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/03/20/Ann-Curry-Ambush-Kirk-Cameron,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,NBC's Curry Attacks Kirk Cameron's Religious Beliefs,"

Shorter Ann Curry: Your religious beliefs represent hate speech! 
Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of a long-term goal:  to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church–all under a Trojan horse labeled “discrimination.” 
In many respects, Obama forcing the Catholic Church to violate its conscience with respect to providing birth control and abortion drugs through their social service institutions is a dry run for this. The left wants to know if they can persuade the American people that a non-existent right (in this case, free birth control) trumps a First Amendment that declaratively restricts the government from impeding the free exercise of religion. 
The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendmen, by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD. 
What Ann Curry did to Kirk Cameron this morning is the first phase of that war: The shaming campaign. On national television, she brought the actor on to declare that his religious belief’s “hate speech” will encourage others to “mistreat gay people.”
We all know what the next step is, and that’s the outlawing of these opinions under the principle that the speaking of such things will cause harm to others.  
This, of course, would mean the end of the church — which is the whole idea.
Newsbusters:
Leading off an interview with conservative Christian actor Kirk Cameron on Tuesday’s NBC Today, co-host Ann Curry immediately attacked him for recent comments he made to CNN’s Piers Morgan: “I’m going to ask you about this firestorm that you set off…on the topic of gay marriage….Many people are suggesting that this is hate speech. Are you encouraging people to feel hate towards gay people?” [Listen to the audio or watch the video after the jump]
Curry plucked out a single sentence from Cameron’s CNN interview: “…you said, quote, ‘I think that it’s unnatural. I think that it’s detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.'” Cameron called out her selective framing of the topic: “I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that’s inappropriate and insensitive.”
Even after Cameron explained that the “edited down” quote “certainly didn’t reflect my full heart on the matter,” Curry still asserted he was encouraging hate: “Do you feel any responsibility saying words like that, that might encourage people to feel that it’s okay to treat – mistreat gay people?”
Cameron pushed back and cited Morgan’s blatant bias on the issue: “Nobody should mistreat anybody….what I think this reveals is that – the interviewer that asked me these questions even used the words with me, “I think your views are destructive” – so what that shows me is that all of us who really think deeply about social issues, like gay marriage, and abortion, and homosexuality, have convictions on issues.” 
Ann Curry and Leftists like her don’t give a damn about gays. If they did, you would see the same amount of hostility directed towards Muslims. "

Yesterday the president and Democrats moved their war on Christmas to outrageous new heights. Their attack was sly like a FOX. They conspired to make it look like Christmas happens every year on TV in this country, with the president flipping the lights on the gigantic NATIONAL Xmas tree, followed by a big show of Christmas carols performed by the likes of Mariah Carey and Aretha Franklin and many others. And it was all televised just to make sure everyone was fooled!
It's a travesty the way they all pretend they aren't soldiers in the war to bury what real Christians hold dear. It's beyond nefarious the way the White House is decorated to the nines at Christmas, almost drowning in Christmas---big old gingerbread houses and God knows how many themed Christmas trees---just to make us think there isn't a war on Christmas. The sheer duplicity of it is mind boggling.
Thank God we've got all our corporations to keep Christmas alive! Without them there would be no mall traffic jams, no over extended credit cards, no Christmas sweaters, no ENDLESS Christmas specials on TV, nothing to deck the halls with, and above all, no mouth watering 4th quarter profits.
This is the assault on our freedom that hangs in the balance people. We must find a way to tear off the mask of lies that is this White House's clever attempt to make it look like they aren't hell bent on firing santa, burning Christmas trees to the ground, and sending the elves to socialist camps.
While we fight the good fight to get Obamacare repealed, they fight to repeal Christmas! And in the sneakiest of ways. If you agree, please send money to your favorite republican representative today! With your dollars we can defeat them, and bring back the true meaning of Christmas. Profit. Nothing more American than that, right?!

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) put on a masterclass in his appearance on NBC News’ Meet the Press with David Gregory on Sunday. In less than twenty minutes, Cruz not only demolished Democrat arguments–as transmitted by the ever-eager Gregory–but also showed a keen insight into debate tactics that Republicans often lack. Here are the five key tactics, which should be studied and drilled into Republican politicians in media training.

1. Question the premise. On two separate occasions, Cruz pushed back against the implicit assumptions in questions Gregory asked–assumptions designed by Gregory to put Cruz on the defensive. In each case, Cruz challenged the question itself before answering, and then used his answer to return to the offensive.
In the first case, Gregory implied Cruz had not engaged in a “debate” about how to “change” Obamacare:
GREGORY: It’s interesting. Democrats say, “You know, the problem with Senator Cruz’s position is that it’s a purist position.” There are problems with Obamacare. The White House admits that. We talked about polling in some quarters indicating great dissatisfaction with the law, as you’re talking about in Town Hall meetings. But you have to engaged in a debate about how they change the law. What you’ve gone out and said is, “Let’s kill the law all together. Let’s de-fund it.”
CRUZ: Actually, with respect, David, I think the premise of your question is wrong. It is the Democrats who have taken the absolutist position. Look, I’ve engaged– I’d like to repeal every word of the law. But that wasn’t my position, even in this fight.
That turnabout created headlines, drawing public attention to the refusal of Democrats to compromise.
In the second case, Gregory brutally distorted a remark by Cruz about Neville Chamberlain:
GREGORY: Do you regret comparing the future of Obamacare to the rise of Hitler in Nazi Germany?
CRUZ: Well, the premise of your question isn’t true. I didn’t make that comparison. What I said is that there have been many voices in Washington who’ve said, “We can’t do this, we can’t do this, we can’t do this.” And I went through the contracts where, over and over again, when facing big challenges, Americans have risen to the occasion, whether it was the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, whether it was going to the moon under John F. Kennedy, or whether it was winning the Cold War.
The addition of Kennedy at the end–to counter Gregory’s false Hitler reference–was a nice touch.
2. Stick to the message. Gregory wanted to make the interview all about a government shutdown. Cruz kept his own answers focused on Obamacare. That frustrated Gregory, who nearly lost his composure: “You’re making an argument….You’ve made all these arguments. My goodness, you went and spoke for 21 hours to make these arguments. You haven’t moved anyone.” Cruz, in contrast, looked calm and focused–and kept the debate on terms where he had the distinct advantage, given Obamacare’s unpopularity.
An additional note on this point: Democrats, having been through the talking-points-factory that is left-wing media training (and produces such robots as Debbie Wasserman Schultz), are very good at sticking to their message, but largely because they simply keep repeating it, regardless of the circumstances. What Cruz did was different, and more effective: he found a way to make his message relevant to each context in the debate.
3. Cite your opponents’ supporters in your favor. Gregory came armed with quotes from Republicans and Beltway conservatives who disapprove of what Cruz is doing. Cruz countered, as he did frequently on the Senate floor, with direct quotes from Democrats’ core constituents, including Teamsters Union leader James Hoffa, who has led a new surge of opposition to Obamacare from the left. Cruz’s ready access to the Hoffa quote also shows the importance of research and preparation, and reflects well on his political staff.
4. Never forget your constituency. My favorite moment in the interview was when Gregory read Cruz an extended quote from George Will, and Cruz responded by saying, effectively, that Will only represents his own view, while a Senator from Texas represents millions of voters who knew what they were getting:
GREGORY: George Will, who’s been a conservative columnist for The Washington Post and others, has been very supportive of you in the past. But he wrote this, this week. I want to have you respond to it…
CRUZ: Look, I’m just trying to fight for 26 million Texans and for the American people. And I’m pretty sure George Will, in that column, argued that what we should be doing is delaying Obamacare, which is exactly what the House of Representatives just voted to do.
5. Believe that your opponent secretly agrees with you. Gregory is certainly on the left, but Cruz never treated him as an enemy. Rather, he approached the host as if he could be brought ’round, given the true facts. The above quote, about George Will, is instructive. Note that Cruz did not say that Will was wrong–instead, he found a point of agreement within Will’s column and emphasized that. By finding ways to show that his opponents might actually agree with him, Cruz encouraged even skeptical viewers to ask themselves whether they might, as well. And his supporters had plenty to cheer without watching yet another Republican guest try to earn points with the press by backtracking on previous convictions."

For the past week, NBC News correspondent Chuck Todd endured withering criticism for suggesting it is not the media's job to expose Republican lies about the Affordable Care Act or, for that matter, anything else. But despite his assertion that the reporter's function is not to seek the objective truth but instead to serve as a stenographer for partisan talking points, Todd has from time to time actually shed light rather than heat. His recent contrast of the all-out GOP obstructionism of Obamacare to Democrats' contribution to the success of President Bush's Medicare prescription drug plan is one example.
Despite last week's embarrassment, Chuck Todd hasn't always represented a net subtraction from the sum of human knowledge. As the GOP's ""Defund Obamacare"" campaign ramped up over the summer, Todd used his NBC ""First Read"" column to actively illuminate rather than passively mislead. As he and his colleagues put it on July 9:
Here's a thought exercise on this summer morning: Imagine that after the controversial Medicare prescription-drug legislation was passed into law in 2003, Democrats did everything they could to thwart one of George W. Bush's top domestic achievements. They launched Senate filibusters to block essential HHS appointees from administering the law; they warned the sports and entertainment industries from participating in any public service announcements to help seniors understand how the law works; and, after taking control of the House of Representatives in 2007, they used the power of the purse to prohibit any more federal funds from being used to implement the law. As it turns out, none of that happened.
That's exactly right. Despite their opposition to the Part D legislation, Democrats didn't just refuse to obstruct Bush's wildly unpopular and completely unfunded $400 billion windfall for insurers and pharmaceutical firms. In Washington and in the states, Democrats helped ensure the successful implementation of a Republican program whose 2006 launch even John Boehner acknowledged was ""horrendous.""
As you'll see below, Todd was right to highlight the polar opposite partisan responses to President Bush's Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and President Obama's Affordable Care Act of 2010.


For starters, almost every Democrat (189 out of 205 in the House, 35 out of 46 in the Senate) voted against Medicare Part D 10 years ago. But unlike the Republicans who uniformly voted no to the ACA in 2010 because they feared what its success would mean for the GOP's political prospects, Democrats opposed Bush's Medicare Rx plan because it was unnecessarily complex and needlessly expensive for taxpayers. After all, the Medicare Modernization didn't just prohibit the federal government from directly negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, but forced beneficiaries to purchase coverage from private insurers rather than expand the lower cost Medicare program to include the new benefit.
For those reasons and more, Medicare Part D was far more unpopular before it launched than Obamacare is now. But that changed over time. Now, 9 out of 10 seniors are happy with the program they once despised. In part, Democratic cooperation explains why.
After all, when the Bush administration spent millions of dollars on television ads beginning in 2004 to promote the new Medicare drug discount cards, Democrats didn't object. (They just asked that the Bush Department of Health and Human Services tell the truth.)  Despite that history and the fact that HHS funds advertising for Medicare enrollment every fall, grandstanding GOP Senator Marco Rubio called for a halt to the current ACA TV spots, accusing HHS of ""blatant misuse of federal dollars.""
The same contrast applies to the so-called ""navigators,"" the dozens of community groups, charitable organization, hospitals and non-profits that will Americans find health insurance now just as they helped the elderly find prescription drug plans. Now, Republicans on Ohio, Georgia, Texas, West Virginia and Florida are boasting about the efforts to block the work of the navigators in their states. As Georgia Insurance Commission Ralph Hudgens crowed:
""Let me tell you what we're doing [about Obamacare.] Everything in our power to be an obstructionist.""
""We have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance. The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we'll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we're going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write 'navigator test' on it.""

As President Bush's former Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt explained in July, the ""navigators"" were critical to the outreach campaign for Medicare Part D:
Before the program was implemented, only 21 percent of seniors had a favorable opinion of it, and 66 percent didn't understand what the reform would mean for them.
So we spent 18 months devising and implementing a campaign to explain the prescription drug benefit, prepare seniors as well as partners -- such as community groups, churches, pharmacies, insurance plans and state and local governments -- and then sign people up. A national bus tour supported each phase. The summer before enrollment (the same period that the ACA is in now) we logged more than 600,000 miles and visited 48 states. As secretary, I made 119 stops in 98 cities. I learned that with a program like the ACA, you can't count on Washington to sell it. You have to reach people where they live, work, pray and play.

Many of the same navigators then (like the AARP) are Obamacare navigators now. Ironically, President Bush and his Republican allies also counted on organization that doesn't exist anymore: ACORN.
Nevertheless, the Bush administration rollout of the Medicare drug benefit for 43 million elderly Americans was a disaster. Ohio Congressman John Boehner admitted as much to Fox News in February 2006:
""The implementation of the Medicare plan has been horrendous,""
As Ezra Klein recently recounted, in a rare moment of candor the future Speaker was right:
In 2006, the bill went into effect. It was a disaster. Computer systems didn't communicate with one another. Seniors were confused. Some of the poorest and sickest enrollees -- ""dual eligibles"" who qualify for aid under both Medicare and Medicaid -- weren't able to get their drugs. It was so bad that in his 2006 State of the Union address, Bush ""said nothing about the new Medicare prescription drug program, an initiative Republicans once hoped to trumpet but has angered many seniors in its implementation,"" reported the Washington Post.
Unlike Republicans like Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) and Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) who have announced they will not answer constituents' calls for help with Obamacare, Democrats took a different approach. As then Senator Hillary Clinton reasoned in 2006:
""I voted against it, but once it passed I certainly determined that I would try to do everything I could to make sure that New Yorkers understood it, could access it, and make the best of it.""
When Wisconsin Senator Kohl, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Aging asked his colleagues ""to put aside any partisan thoughts to work together to get this program running,"" Democratic governors were already spending billions of dollars to help out.
As the Washington Post reported in January 2006, ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. By January 16th, 2006, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue. ""About 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program."" Among the governors taking action were future Obamacare foes Tim Pawlenty and Mike Huckabee, who declared a health emergency in his state of Arkansas. The fiasco prompted the Bush administration to take drastic measures:
With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug.
It's no wonder why Paul Krugman summed up the whole catastrophe as ""D for Debacle.""
The blame for that debacle has to be placed squarely at the feet of President Bush and his Republican allies who structured the Medicare Part D bill. But once the ill-conceived legislation was the law of the land, Democrats didn't stand in their way. They helped make it work. Democrats didn't go the Supreme Court, or refuse to accept coverage for millions in their states, or say no to enforcing new insurance rules or try to prevent the work of the navigators receiving federal grants to provide information and customer service to Americans.
As Chuck Todd explained in a rare act of journalism, only Republicans do that.

I do not regularly praise TIME Magazine. In fact, I'm known in some quarters for my harsh critiques of both the magazine's content as well as its cover selections.
However, the magazine has hit a home run with its upcoming cover for October 14:



Yes, this image perfectly encapsulates the current government shutdown, in which a fringe band of GOP representatives in the House have effectively held the federal government hostage (with the help of the GOP's spineless leadership).
However, this image also perfectly encapsulates, unintentionally, the extent to which our elected officials truly represent America's citizenry today. For as mainstream pundits yap about which monuments might close, the wealth gap between those who have, and those who have not, is larger than it's ever been.  
New Yorkers with two jobs are increasingly becoming homeless. Metropolises are becoming income distribution wastelands. Things are getting worse for so many.
And today, a small collection of lawmakers is focused on shutting down the government, rather than ensure it functions for those who need it most.
The majority is not ruling. In so many ways.

North Carolina State Senate Leader and Art Pope loyalist, Phil Berger (R), who is considered a serious contender for the 2014 U.S. Senate race was busted for spreading lies about Obamacare:
http://www.journalnow.com/...


Months after the U.S. Supreme Court settled the debate about much of the federal health care law, Senate leader Phil Berger is circulating an online petition to “Stop Obamacare in North Carolina.”
The petition appears on the Eden Republican’s campaign website. And its language perpetuates one of the bigger myths about the Affordable Care Act, said Mark Hall, a health policy expert at Wake Forest University’s law school.
“These arguments have been rejected – it is the law of the land,” said Hall.
The petition is tied to the state Senate’s passage of legislation that prevents the expansion of Medicaid and a state-sponsored health insurance exchange, two key provisions of President Barack Obama’s health care law. - Winston-Salem Journal, 2/9/13

Here's what the petition on Berger's website states:
http://www.wral.com/...


""Please help me stop Obamacare in North Carolina,"" Berger writes on his campaign website. The note continues:
We already passed a bill in the Senate that protects us from:
    The government turning our health records over to the IRS
    Government-forced insurance
    Billions in new taxes on businesses and the people of North Carolina
The form then invites people to sign a petition that would presumably be presented to opponents of Senate Bill 4. - WRAL, 2/8/13

Ok, now here are the facts:
http://www.newsobserver.com/...
The premise that the Senate is protecting the state is misleading, policy experts said. Even with the legislation now awaiting House action, the state is subject to most of the federal health care law. If North Carolina doesn’t set up a marketplace for purchasing insurance, called an exchange, the federal government will establish one for the state.
The U.S. Supreme Court case upholding the Affordable Care Act in June 2012 gave states discretion about whether to expand Medicaid coverage to those making 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $31,809 for a family of four. Most other provisions of the health care law are not affected by state action, policy experts said.
As for the claim that the law will require the government to turn over health records to the IRS, Hall said that is simply not true.
The IRS is the agency charged with determining whether individuals get health insurance or pay a penalty, as the law mandates. But the IRS is not going to ask for health records. The agency has told Congress that it expects taxpayers to get a form from their health insurance company certifying coverage and attach it to their federal return.
The final point about taxes is based in the law. The measure raises $525 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan division, to pay for health care for an estimated 32 million people by 2019. The taxes range from a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for high-income earners to an excise tax on indoor tanning services. Hall said it is safe to assume more than $1 billion likely will hit North Carolina payers on whole. - Charlotte News Observer, 2/8/13

So why is Berger continuing to push these lies about the Affordable Health Care Act?  To help build his support for the crowded GOP primary:
Chris Sinclair, a Republican strategist at Cornerstone Solutions in Raleigh and an expert in digital campaigns, said it is a way to collect names and contact information for like-minded supporters – information that proves useful in future campaigns, fundraising and voter mobilization efforts.
It’s particularly true with hot button issues. In Pat McCrory’s gubernatorial campaign, Sinclair used contact information collected from a voter ID petition to engage supporters ahead of the election.
“The only reason you do a petition is to acquire followers and acquire advocates for your position,” said Sinclair. “It can be tremendously successful.” - Winston-Salem Journal, 2/9/13

Health experts have claimed that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could help the state meet costs it will already have to pay such as a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department over how the state cares for certain mentally ill patients:
http://www.wral.com/...


Right now, thousands of patients are in state psychiatric hospitals or adult care homes not because they need intense supervision, Corey Dunn, director of public policy for Disability Rights North Carolina said, but because it's the only place they can get key services. In particular, many of these patients need help remembering to take their medication.
""Medication management is a major reason why people have accepted a more institutional level of care than they really need,"" Dunn said.
The Justice Department has said the state needs to move away from this preference toward putting people in institutional settings rather than in less restrictive community settings.  
In order to move people out of these institutional settings, the state will need to create a network of community providers. Expanding Medicaid would help because it would narrow a gap in what Medicaid pays for people in institutions versus those who live in the community. - WRAL, 2/4/13

Berger is just one of the dogs Art Pope has in this race.  The other is House Speaker Thom Tillis (R).  The Pope Foundation played a huge rule in the GOP's complete take over of the North Carolina legislator and Governorship:
http://www.dailykos.com/...


Mr. McCrory first ran for governor in 2008 but was beaten by Ms. Perdue, then the lieutenant governor, who became the state’s first female governor. As a mayor on the moderate side of his party, Mr. McCrory had bipartisan support and was perhaps best known for revitalizing Charlotte with projects like a light-rail system and the Nascar museum.
His large transition team is being studied for signs of whether he will turn more conservative. It is heavy with Republican politicians and business leaders, including former members of President George W. Bush’s administration and former governors. The most controversial figures on the team are the billionaire businessman Art Pope and some of his allies who are connected to the John William Pope Foundation. The group, which is dedicated to conservative and free-market ideas, has given millions of dollars to libertarian and conservative groups, including the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Prosperity. - New York Times, 12/11/12

And look who's orchestrating Governor Pat McCrory's (R. NC) budget:


Gov.-elect Pat McCrory expanded his cabinet selections by three on Thursday, and named a trio of key staffers that includes controversial political financier Art Pope.
Pope – whose network of organizations promotes a limited-government agenda – will be the new governor’s top budget-writer. A multimillionaire, he will take a leave from his retail chain store business, as well as from his family foundation and all public and nonprofit boards he serves on in order to take the job without pay. - Charlotte News Observer, 12/21/12

So yeah, Pope's loyal crony, Berger, is trying to get a head start in the primary by continuing to push the same lies Republicans have been pushing about the Affordable Health Care Act.  Berger and Tillis are seriously considering challenging incumbent Senator Kay Hagan (D. NC) but Pope's top choices might have to deal with this guy:
http://www.beaufortobserver.net/...


The Republican Liberty Caucus and The Eastern North Carolina Tea Party have united behind a Wake County physician’s effort to unseat U.S. Senator Kay Hagan.   Dr. Greg Brannon of Cary has thrown his hat in the ring as a GOP challenger to US Senator Kay Hagan — who is up for reelection in 2014.
Brannon announced his intentions Saturday at a Tea Party event in Winterville, North Carolina.  Regular listeners of the Bill LuMaye radio show in The Triangle  may recognize Brannon, who is a frequent guest.   Brannon also is known for his work with a grassroots organization called Founders’ Truth. - The Daily Haymaker, 1/28/13

You can hear Brannon's craziness here:
http://www.founderstruth.org/
Hagan is very well aware of how tough of a race she's going in and she is getting ready.  She has over $1.3 million in the bank and she hired former Obama For American North Carolina director, Lindsay Siler, as a senior adviser to oversee constituent outreach and engagement.  Hagan also promoted her deputy communications director, Sadie Weiner, to communications director.  Weiner has also worked on Senator Sherrod Brown's (D. OH) 2012 re-election campaign.  She has also made herself available to her constituents with her ""Conversations with Kay"" community meetings that she has held in all 100 counties.  She's even teamed up with Senators Jeff Merkley (D. OR), Mark Udall (D. CO) and Jeanne Shaheen (D. NH) to help raise money for each other's campaigns:
http://www.dailykos.com/...


Four Democratic senators who are up for reelection in 2014 have joined forces on fundraising.
Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Mark Udall (D-Colo.) created a joint fundraising committee last week called Senate Victory 2014, according to Federal Election Commission records.
Hagan is the most vulnerable senator in the group, and could face a tough reelection fight if a strong Republican challenger emerges, according to a recent poll.
Hagan is also the strongest fundraiser of the four, ending the last reporting period with more than $1.3 million in the bank. - The Hill, 1/28/13

It's still a while away but it's good to get an early start for 2014, especially when the whole local legislator is in the pockets of Art Pope which will spend big to get rid of Hagan.  Lets keep the Senate blue and donate to Hagan's campaign:

David Vitter, genius.

The dissension rampant in the Republican conference in the House of Representatives has spilled over to the Senate Republicans, where Sen. David Vitter's bizarre anti-Obamacare campaign is starting to piss off his Republican colleagues.
A growing number of Republicans are scoffing at Louisiana Sen. David Vitter’s push to stop federal contributions that will help pay for health coverage for lawmakers and their staff under the new Obamacare exchanges. Vitter’s crusade has effectively put his GOP colleagues in the unenviable position of hurting themselves and their staff financially or siding with another political attack on a law the party universally despises.
The latest pushback is another sign of how the long-running GOP fight to repeal Obamacare has suddenly degenerated into an internal Republican battle, prompting widespread concerns among party elders.
“One of our strengths in this fight—even though we had minority numbers in both the House and the Senate when the law passed—was that no Republicans voted for it in the Senate,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of his party’s leadership. “Somehow, some of our members seem to think there’s forward progress in figuring out ways to divide us on something we’re totally united on. That can’t be a good idea.”

Again, has anyone ever accused David Vitter of having good ideas? Senate Republicans are probably just pissed the Vitter is making them look like House Republicans, because there's nothing that creates more disdain in a senator than the House.
Vitter isn't doing much to bring fellow Republicans to his side, either. When fellow Republicans like Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins and Saxby Chambliss raise the issue that Vitter's plan would take affordable health insurance away from congressional staff, and that that wasn't particularly fair, Vitter staffer Luke Bolar, (who would also lose his insurance) responded: “Lotta Americans getting screwed under Obamacare and won’t get a taxpayer subsidy.” So, basically, ""fuck all my coworkers."" That'll win friends and influence people.
Stand with Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in denouncing Republicans who would completely shut down the government just to destroy Obamacare.

On Thursday, President Obama took to the White House podium to triumphantly announce the end of the government shutdown. In doing so, he proclaimed that he wanted to push forward with other legislative priorities, including a budget, immigration reform, and the long-stalled pork-laden farm bill. 
“[I]n the coming days and weeks, we should sit down and pursue a balanced approach to a responsible budget, a budget that grows our economy faster and shrinks our long-term deficits further,” Obama stated. Historically, “balanced” has been code for tax increases. 
Obama then pushed on to immigration reform: “Number two. We should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system.” Naturally, he blamed the Republican House for stalling his preferred immigration bill.
Finally, Obama called for the farm bill to be passed: “Number three. We should pass a farm bill, one that American farmers and ranchers can depend on, one that protects vulnerable children and adults in times of need, one that gives rural communities opportunities to grow and the long-term certainty that they deserve.” And, disingenuously, he called for negotiations.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) echoed Obama, saying, “I look forward to the next venture, which is making sure we do immigration reform.” On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Obama wanted immigration reform “more than anything else” during his second term. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-CA) said that he trusted that Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) would cave on immigration: “Once again, the speaker for the majority party is going to be placed in a position of deciding whether he’s going to put country before party and get something done. We just need a few courageous Republicans to stand up and say they’re ready.”
Republicans, however, pushed back. “It’s not going to happen this year,” said Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID). “After the way the president acted over the last two or three weeks where he would refuse to talk to the speaker of the House…they’re not going to get immigration reform. That’s done.”

The press seems a little bemused that they have to take Kerry seriously now, after their treatment of him in 2004.
Timothy Egan:
The net result, accidental or not, is that Syria is no longer just an American problem. They say they will give up the poison gas that, wink, wink, was never used. The principle, as Obama said, “that with modest effort and risk we stop children from being gassed to death,” is there on the table for a world that preferred to look the other way. And, added bonus: the neocon warriors are gone, homeless in both parties. All of this is a hugely positive leap from where we were a week, a month, or a year ago.
But outcomes don’t really matter to those obsessed by who won and who lost, those who see all politics as up-and-down nonsense instead of a clash of ideas with real consequences. So this past week has to be cast in the tired terms of the daily struggle for sound-bite supremacy. It’s a debacle. A blunder. A humiliation. “This rudderless diplomacy,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican Party, “has embarrassed America on the world stage.”
You want embarrassment? Just consider some of the public statements of Republicans in the last two weeks.

I talked about the death of neocon ideology this week on the Kagro in the Morning show. I'm apparently not the only one to notice.
Monte Frank on another international embarrassment:
Just two weeks ago, a gunman entered a school in Georgia with an AK-47 and began shooting. An Australian baseball player was senselessly murdered in Oklahoma City. Elementary schools in Colorado hold drills where five-year-old kids hunker down behind tables while an ""active shooter"" knocks at the door. Just this week, Colorado voters ejected in recall elections two state senators who had sponsored new gun control laws in the wake of the Aurora cinema mass shooting. And the grim parade of gun violence in our cities marches on.
This madness must end – and it will when Congress stops ignoring the will of the American people and makes our nation and the entire world safer by passing common-sense and constitutional gun safety measures. The vast majority of Americans, including gun owners, agree on what needs to be done to cure our gun violence epidemic, which will not only save lives, but spare America from embarrassment in the world.

More politics and policy below the fold.



Addictinginfo.com (see graphic at top):
This is why intelligence and knowledge is disparaged in the country that reached the Moon. These days, intellectuals are mocked as “faggy” and unmanly as if brute strength somehow contributed to the technical prowess, economic agility and innovation that made America a superpower.
This is why our politics are a disaster. When you raise a generation to believe that throwing a ball is more important than fulfilling their civic duty to make informed decisions, you allow charlatans to sell their lies to the public unchallenged.

Peter Beinert:
Bill de Blasio’s win in New York’s Democratic primary isn’t a local story. It’s part of a vast shift that could upend three decades of American political thinking.
One of the more talked about articles this week, and worth a read.
NY Times:
In an effort to balance its budget, NPR said on Friday that it would try to reduce its staff about 10 percent through voluntary buyouts.
The announcement was depicted as one of the most substantial staff cutbacks in the history of the public radio organization. NPR would not comment on whether it would resort to layoffs if it did not achieve the desired reductions through buyouts.

Jeb Bush used to actually have the illusion of class.  He used to seem like the ""Reasonable Republican"", but now we can see those are about as plentiful as a herd of Unicorns on the fields of Trenzalore.

Why would our President close our Embassy to the Vatican? Hopefully, it is not retribution for Catholic organizations opposing Obamacare.
— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) November 27, 2013
It's truly amazing.  This is like the Empty Chair Speech where Clint Eastwood imagined that the current sitting President would be so crass as to tell his Republican opponent to ""Go Fuck Himself"" - all over again.
There's nothing - Nothing - about this that bodes well for the current state of the Conservative Psyche.


Their mental version of Obama isn't all that different from their mental picture of Trayvon Martin.  Violent and Dangerous and Petty.  It's the same thing, they simply can't escape the vision of the Angry. Black. Thug. tm even when a well-dressed, well spoken, highly educated, intelligent, even tempered, considerate and more than a ton accommodating Black Man who happens to be the leader of the Free World is before them.. they still see nothing more than a Mean Little Punk.
A Muslim. A Kenyan. An America Hater, the Food Stamp President who wants everyone in the Country in the Thrall of the Federal Government as PAYBACK for Slavery - and who I guess must hate Catholics because - well - why not, right? We got 'em, why not Hate Them?
But scratch the surface of this little fantasy and it  falls apart faster than a paper machete mache castle doused in liter fluid.
First of all, the Embassy isn't being ""Closed"" - it's being moved Closer to the Vatican as part of a process that was initiated By His Brother.
There are no embassies for any country in Vatican City itself — there is simply no room. All countries locate their embassies in the city of Rome. The United States has decided to move its embassy from its current location — an unremarkable converted residence — to the same compound as the U.S. Embassy to Italy. It will have it’s own separate building and a separate entrance on a different street. The new building is actually a tenth of a mile closer to the Vatican than the old one. There will be no reduction in staff or activities.
...
The State Department says the move, which will actually occur in 2015, will save $1.4 million per year and allow for greater security.

Imagine that, Obama is moving the Embassy to a) Save Money and b) Improve Security.  Now, why on Earth would he ever care about such things?
The second part is that the Catholic Church doesn't oppose Obamacare. They actually have enthusiastically endorsed it.
Washington, DC, September 20, 2011 (LifeSiteNews.com) - The Catholic Health Association (CHA) released a statement last week lauding the effects of Obama’s health care reform program.
“Provisions of the Affordable Care Act that became effective last year have helped millions get the coverage they need,” wrote CHA President Carol Keehan.
Sr. Carol Keehan of the Catholic Health Association.
“At least 500,000 young adults (ages 18-24), for example, obtained health insurance last year, a two percentage point increase that is the result of an ACA provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ plan,” Keehan continued.
She went on to urge lawmakers to “keep our nation’s vulnerable persons in mind” as they deliberate over fiscal policy.

In fact a majority of Catholics even support the Contraceptive Policy.
Public Policy Polling conducted the new poll on behalf of a coalition that includes Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. The findings indicate that Obama gained some ground with Catholics by altering the policy. An earlier PPP poll found that 53 percent of Catholic voters approved of the White House's original mandate, which required religious employers to provide contraception coverage directly.
There is an outstanding case going to the Supreme Court over that very issue, but it's certainly not something that deserves Retaliation over.  It's a difference of opinion, a disagreement and in a ""Free Country"" you're supposed to be able to have those from time to time.  Or so you would think.
So let's think this out, Jeb Bush actually believes it's a serious proposition that the President of these United States could have decided to pettily embarrass Catholics and damage our international standing by capriciously and with full callousness of forethought closing the Vatican Embassy (and I guess in his mind not re-opening it in a more secure location, Ever!) merely out of a Fit of Pique!.
Really?
I mean, it's not like doing such a thing could be considered as a way to make his policies more popular with Religious Organizations who object to not doing a thing while their employees and students get preventive healthcare, is it? How does this argument - even as a projection - make any damn sense at all?  Is that what Jeb Bush would do if the Catholics pissed him off? Gee, thanks for the heads up.
This is the kind of thing you expect from World Net Daily. (In fact, it's their Stock-in-Trade), not from Mainstream Republicans.
But then again, they do seem to running of out the sane undeluded ones aren't they?  Sadly, their delusions don't make the President look bad, it only makes them look pathetic. And Desperate.

Last week, 60 Minutes did a major Benghazi piece featuring a security contractor who evidently lied to them.
60 Minutes gave the guy a fake name, but his story of being an eyewitness to the attack was soon discovered to contradict what he had reported to his superiors.
Far from retracting or correcting the story, or mentioning that the contractor's book is being published by a CBS subsidiary that ""specializes in conservative nonfiction,"" 60 Minutes ended its show tonight with three teabaggerish letters praising the story.
As if the substantial media controversy over the contractor's credibility never happened.
For right-wingers, the Benghazi conspiracy theory is a two-fer -- weakening both the current Democratic President and his likely Democratic successor.
Which is why wingnut radio, Fox ""News"", and sites like Drudge and World Nut Daily have been beating the Benghazi drum for more than a year.
For 60 Minutes to join that motley crew of serial liars is shameful.
Then to refuse to correct the flawed story, instead broadcasting letters praising it, is even worse.
It's like they don't even care about the truth -- it's all about the money.

Speaking in Ireland this week, President Obama stated that Catholic schools were divisive: “If towns remain divided–if Catholics have their schools and buildings and Protestants have theirs, if we can’t see ourselves in one another and fear or resentment are allowed to harden–that too encourages division and discourages cooperation.” On Thursday, the American Catholics for Religious Freedom fired back on President Obama’s words to 2,000 young people at the G8 Summit, stating, “President Obama’s anti-faith, secular agenda was shamefully on full display yesterday when he told the young people of Northern Ireland that Catholic education and other faith-based schools were divisive and an obstacle to peace.  All Americans of faith should be outraged by these comments which clearly telegraph the President’s belief system and are in fact at their core even anti-American.”
American Catholics for Religious Freedom points out that the media has completely ignored the story, and adds, “Secular progressives like President Obama ignore the truth that faith-based education is a component of the Religious Freedom guaranteed by the Constitution.  He can’t bear the thought that Catholic and parochial schools not only teach important values but consistently produce better educational results at lower cost than America’s failing public schools. The President’s troubling values are showing here in a way that demonstrate just how dangerous this Administration is and how committed it is to eroding the rights of all people of faith.”
And, they note, this is the same President who has attempted to cram down anti-Catholic doctrine via Obamacare. “It’s time Americans stood up for Religious Freedom, for the U.S. Constitution and against President Obama’s radical views about the place of faith in American life,” the group concludes.

When the American mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked on September 11th, 2012, only one person had the positional authority, legal mandate, and communications apparatus to give the order to defend our personnel on the ground: the President of the United States.
The President did not give that order, and four Americans died in Benghazi that day. All the rest of the nonsense to which we have been treated-from prepared talking points, congressional hearings, and finally to the outright lies-matter not when compared to the ignominious moments in which the President of the United States refused to do his job.
That same day, two other American embassies in the Middle East were also under attack in Sana, Yemen and Cairo, Egypt. As a result, our intelligence systems were on high alert. When the calls, satellite and drone feeds, faxes, and reports began bombarding every command center from Germany to the United States, our nation, already at war for eleven years, was again under siege. Staffs from Africa Command, European Command, the National Military Command Center, the CIA Operations Center, the State Department Operations Center, and the White House Situation Room were fully operational.
This all means that on September 11, 2012, our national security apparatus was on full alert. It means everyone was briefed. This is how it works; no games, no conjecture, no television and movie looks, just real battle in real time with real lives at risk.
The road to that indecision is littered with policy and leadership failures that culminated in an American mission and clandestine CIA base being attacked and the murder of our Ambassador and three dedicated Americans doing their jobs. However, the one person responsible for it all is the one man who could have, but refused to, even try to stop the carnage… the President of the United States.
All the President had to say within the first two hours while being briefed by the Secretary of Defense was, “Send in a response force.” This command, followed by his signature on a paper called Cross Border Authority, would have ordered the Department of Defense to do everything and anything to save lives in Benghazi, Libya. 
Three and a half years earlier, on April 9, 2009, President Obama had done exactly that when pirates hijacked an American flagged merchant ship, Maersk Alabama, sailing off the coast of Somalia. In this earlier incident, the President made the right decision within hours to allow SEAL Team Six the time to plan and go. In the end, we all witnessed a textbook successful rescue operation. 
Fast forward to September 11, 2012, and we have a desperate situation with Americans in jeopardy. The same President, instead of deciding how to respond, disappeared for the evening  and then went to Las Vegas the following day to raise money for his re-election campaign.
Had the President ordered a rescue, he had everything he needed to mount a prompt and forceful response–from F-16’s in Aviano, Italy, to an armed and fueled plane standing by at C Company, 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, training in Croatia-a mere three hours from Benghazi by air. 
When the first shot was fired in Benghazi, no one knew how long the fight would last. Subsequent government claims saying we could not get there within the seven-plus hours that the tragedy lasted are specious at best and an outright lie at worst. We did not even care enough to try; that fact alone should make all Americans who mourn the loss of four of our countrymen very angry.
This ultimate Presidential control–the ability to bring armed American forces to bear anywhere in the world within hours–has existed for over 25 years. It exists precisely because of past mistakes and embarrassing moments brought to us by various governmental agencies, congresses, and presidents.
Since September 11th, 2012, we have been treated to a tractor-trailer load of misdirection, disingenuous speeches, television appearances, and outright lying by public officials at every level of the government of the United States of America. Now with other scandals hitting the news, we are beginning to forget and confuse what is the only important point to know after we acknowledge and pray for the four Americans murdered by terrorists that fateful day.
There is one simple point to be made about Benghazi: the President of the United States is the only human being on the planet that can order a bullet, a missile, a plane, a drone, a boat, a helicopter, a soldier, sailor, spy, or push cart with a squirt gun attached to go into another country and perform an aggressive action.
On September 11, 2012, we know the President failed to give that order. We don’t know where he was, what he was doing, or why he failed to act. But we do know he failed to act, and that inaction cost the lives of four brave Americans."

Several members of Congress joined representatives of the special forces military veterans and grassroots organizations on Tuesday to launch an effort to force the House to have a thorough, public investigation into the terrorist attack at Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012.
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) has introduced legislation to create a special select committee to investigate both the terrorist attack and subsequent actions by President Barack Obama’s administration and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department. Wolf’s bill has 161 co-sponsors. House GOP Leadership has not scheduled a vote on the bill. 
Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) plans to harness the support for Wolf’s bill into a “discharge petition” that would force a floor vote on the bill. The petition would need to be signed by 218 members of the House. 
“I’m going to describe what a discharge petition is because a lot of people have asked me questions exactly what it is,” Stockman said at the Tuesday press conference outside the U.S. Capitol building. “It’s to ask our leadership or actually demand from our leadership that we have a vote on Frank Wolf’s bill. [Wolf is] a congressman from Virginia who has a long history of being here and is articulate in demanding that we have an independent investigation.”
Stockman added, while gesturing to blown up photographs behind him of the four Americans murdered in Benghazi, “if Congress is silenced,” then “the blood of these folks behind us is on our hands.”
“We can’t be silent any more,” he said. “It’s been a year going by that we haven’t had justice. These folks demand justice. They cry out for justice. Silence is not an option any more. We’re going to challenge them. We’re going to have a discharge petition. I encourage you to contact your congressman to sign the discharge petition.”  
Stockman expects most or all of the 161 members on Wolf’s bill to support the discharge petition, and at the press conference specifically said House Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) is supportive of circumventing House Leadership via the discharge petition.
Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Dick Brauer, the founder of Special Operations Speaks, said the combination of Wolf’s bill and Stockman’s discharge petition “would be done to fully investigate, something that has not been done to date, the national tragedy in Benghazi, where we lost four great citizens in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.”
“You will hear this from me and others today but we need your help and your friends’ help and everybody else’s to make this happen because it’s our one chance to do something before the anniversary of that tragedy which will occur about seven weeks from now,” Brauer said.
At the press conference, Brauer’s group unrolled an enormous scroll of a petition that includes the signatures of about a thousand special forces veterans joining the call for this investigation. “What you see on my left is a one of a kind. I don’t think it’s ever been done before: a four-foot-by-sixty-foot copy of the Special Operations Speaks petition that we sent to the House of Representatives on the Eighth of April asking for this select committee with subpoena power,” Brauer said. “The scroll is signed by nearly 1,000 special operations veterans, from the rank of Lieutenant General Three Stars down to every other rank you can imagine, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, all of them passionate about what we’re trying to do.”
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX), a congressman who supports the discharge petition, said at the press conference that he was asked by a reporter recently about Benghazi: “Gee, that was so long ago. Do we really want to pursue this now?”
“I told the reporter that when I was a judge handling felony cases, I had defendants ask me that question – ‘that was so long ago, do we really need to get into all this now?’ I can tell you when the blood of American patriots cries out, when the blood of individuals who were sent there into harm’s way, knowing how dangerous it was in Benghazi, and especially two former SEALs who were even told to ‘Stand Down’ but they wouldn’t have it,” Gohmert said. “They went to save lives and that’s exactly what they did. They even recruited another State Department man, a former army ranger, to go up there on the rooftop with them. What they knew from the first moment mortars were fired was that this was an organized, well-prepared attack on our people. We need to get to the bottom of it. Their blood cries out for that.”
Former Florida Republican Rep. Allen West concurred with the others there, adding: “If it’s more important to some people in Washington, D.C., to protect President Obama and to protect former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I say shame on you. Every single member of the United States House of Representatives should have their name on this discharge petition. If their name is not on that discharge petition, you are complicit in this cover-up of what happened.”
Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy said that if the truth is not uncovered in Benghazi, a terrorist attack like it is likely to happen again. “I believe that this is not likely to be an isolated incident,” Gaffney said at the press conference “If we don’t learn the lessons of what happened in Benghazi, how we got to there, what we did on the occasion and what has happened in the aftermath, you can be sure there will be other Americans who end with the same fate.”
Bob Adams, the president and founder of grassroots group Revive America which has been rallying members of Congress behind the calls for a real investigation into Benghazi, placed the blame for the lack of a real investigation at the feet of House GOP leadership.
“When Revive America first joined this fight back in March, only 48 House Republicans had mustered the courage to stand as cosponsors of this bill,” Adams said. “Frankly, the level of support at that time was an embarrassment. But over the next several weeks, after thousands of Americans had deluged Congress with a flood of phone calls, emails and personal visits, support for the House Select Committee soared to what is today 161 cosponsors. That’s over two thirds of all House Republicans.”
“But today only one person really stands in the way of a full and public investigation of the 9/11 terrorist attack in Benghazi. It’s not President Obama. It’s really not even Hillary Rodham Clinton, or Eric Holder. That one person is none other than House Speaker John Boehner.”"
189,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/10/28/CBS-60-Minutes-Try-to-Atone-for-Benghazi-Cover-up,News,Breitbart,Republican,"CBS, '60 Minutes' Try to Atone for Benghazi Cover-Up","
On Sunday evening, CBS News’ 60 Minutes featured an investigative report on the Benghazi attacks by Lara Logan. Logan’s reporting confirmed that the Obama administration had been warned, months in advance, about inadequate security at the U.S. facility in Benghazi, and that it knew the story about a YouTube video was untrue. It was a reversal for CBS News, which played a key role in the Benghazi cover-up in 2012.
A year ago, CBS News released a previously unaired clip of an interview for 60 Minutes with President Barack Obama on Sep. 12, the day after the Benghazi attack, in which the president suggests clearly that the attack on the U.S. consulate was premeditated. The interview contradicted Obama’s subsequent claims that the attack had been a response to an anti-Islam YouTube video, repeated to the public for several days.
CBS News had withheld that portion of the Sep. 12 interview until Oct. 19, choosing instead to release a portion in which Obama criticized rival Mitt Romney’s condemnation of the administration’s response to events–a repeated theme as the media helped Obama deflect responsibility. Romney had attacked the White House’s apology for the video during the attack on the Cairo embassy, not knowing of the deaths in Libya.
After the election, Kroft continued to insist that there was “no information that anything’s been covered up” by the media or the Obama administration about the Benghazi attacks. That statement was wrong based on what was known at the time, and looks even worse today, after whistleblowers testified to Congress earlier this year they were pressured by Clinton’s chief of staff not to cooperate with congressional investigators.
Logan’s investigation featured an interview with one of those whistleblowers, Greg Hicks, who had been the deputy to slain U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. Logan also interviewed “Morgan Jones” (pseudonym), a former British soldier who had been advising the U.S. on security in Benghazi and had warned the State Department that Libyan guards being trained to guard the compound were not up to the job.
Morgan’s warnings came to fruition on Sep. 11, 2012, when he saw the guards disperse after being told by the attackers: “We’re here to kill Americans, not Libyans.” Morgan did what little he could to stop the attack. A second attack at the CIA Annex was partly fought off by a small group that saved five American lives and has since, Logan reported, earned “the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross” for its bravery.
Yet the Obama administration did not send any assistance throughout the night, and is thought to have issued a stand-down order to prevent any intervention. What Logan’s report makes clear is that there is no way that President Obama or his Secretary of State could plausibly claim that a YouTube video had inspired a spontaneous act of violence on that scale against the U.S. consulate, the CIA annex and their personnel.
That story was a lie when it was told–and it was a lie aided and abetted by the mainstream media, including CBS News and 60 Minutes, which could have exploded the administration’s YouTube video alibi even as Obama and Clinton were telling it to the families of the victims, to the voting public, and to the world. The Sunday night report is commendable, but as an attempt to atone for malpractice, it is far too little, too late.

A new documentary on Showtime is revealing Dick Cheney at his most unguarded. With time he no longer cares about hiding the truth.
He is going to die an old man in his bed. How many people won't because of his crimes?


Via Maureen Dowd:
Talking to Mr. Cutler in his deep headmaster's monotone, Mr. Cheney dispenses with the fig leaf of ""we."" He no longer feigns deference to W., whom he now disdains for favoring Condi over him in the second term and for not pardoning ""Cheney's Cheney,"" Scooter Libby.
""I had a job to do,"" he said.
Continuing: ""I got on the telephone with the president, who was in Florida, and told him not to be at one location where we could both be taken out."" Mr. Cheney kept W. flying aimlessly in the air on 9/11 while he and Lynn left on a helicopter for a secure undisclosed location, leaving Washington in a bleak, scared silence, with no one reassuring the nation in those first terrifying hours.
""I gave the instructions that we'd authorize our pilots to take [the Pennsylvania flight] out... After I'd given the order, it was pretty quiet. Everybody had heard it, and it was obviously a significant moment.""

There's no more pretending that this was anything other than a Cheney presidency, at least for Bush's un-elected 'first term.' Don't believe me? Read on:
In his memoir, W. described feeling ""blindsided"" again and again. In this film, the blindsider is the eminence grise who was supposed to shore up the untested president. The documentary reveals the Iago lengths that Mr. Cheney went to in order to manipulate the unprepared Junior Bush...
...He filled W.'s head with stories about conflicts between presidents and vice presidents sparked by the vice president's ambition, while protesting that he himself did not want the job.
...He was always goosing up W.'s insecurities so he could take advantage of them. To make his crazy and appallingly costly detour from Osama to Saddam by cherry-picking his fake case for invading Iraq, he played on W.'s fear of being lampooned as a wimp, as his father had been.

Here's a deal: I can almost forgive Bush--I'll settle for Cheney in prison and Bush can be convicted of the crimes that he committed and then have his sentence commuted. It's incredible to compare what happened with Watergate--remember Barbara Jordan?--to the rabbit role we went down with Iraq, torture, spying, vote-rigging, kickbacks, conflicts of interest, corporate giveaways, economic terrorism and inside men.
This is a matter of justice and responsibility.  This failure does not hang solely on President Obama's head or Nancy Pelosi's, although she sure deserves a lot of the blame. It hangs on the whole Democratic Party, and the whole nation, including the rotten state of the Republican Party.

Via TVNewser, here’s a transcript between Fox News’ Ed Henry and White House spokesman Jay Carney over just how qualified Susan Rice is for her promotion to National Security Adviser. With no good answer, Carney plays to the media crowd and renews the White House attacks on Fox News. 
A full five days after the September 11 terror attack in Benghazi, we are apparently supposed to believe Susan Rice was the only person in America who had no idea whatsoever four Americans might have just maybe/probably been the victims of a terror attack:
Henry: You described (Rice) as one of the most qualified, experienced foreign policy experts in America. If that’s the case, how did she get the information on Benghazi so wrong five days after the attack?
Carney: Ed, I would welcome the opportunity to correct the record especially for some news outlets who persist in misrepresenting the facts. You have seen the so-called talking points. You have seen the testimony of the deputy director of the CIA and the documents that demonstrate that the central point that they made was drafted in the first instance and every instance thereafter.
Henry: Then why did various intelligence officers say that they almost immediately knew that this was terror and if she’s so experienced why wouldn’t she see that as they saw it?
Carney: So you are suggesting that a senior member of the national security team should disagree with the assessments of the intelligence community because somebody appeared on Fox News and said something?
A crucial piece of context the media ignores about Susan Rice is that after her appointment to U.N. Ambassador, President Obama turned that position into a cabinet position. This means she was part of security briefings. 
Still, a full five days after the attack, when everyone but the White House was admitting what we all knew to be true, Rice claimed there was no evidence of a premeditated terror attack. 
That means she is either dumb or dishonest. Either way, she is not qualified to serve fries much less as a top-level adviser to the American president. 
Carney, though, can get away with openly mocking Fox News as a defense because the rest of the lapdogs in that room hate Fox News just as much as Obama does. When it comes to Obama, the media focus is always about hammering those who search for the truth.
Fox has been searching for the truth, and that makes them a media target.

These people, these are the enemy.................
Believing they are losing the messaging war with progressives, a group of prominent conservatives in Washington—including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and journalists from Breitbart News and the Washington Examiner—has been meeting privately since early this year to concoct talking points, coordinate messaging, and hatch plans for ""a 30 front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation,"" according to documents obtained by Mother Jones.

Dubbed Groundswell, this coalition convenes weekly in the offices of Judicial Watch, the conservative legal watchdog group. During these hush-hush sessions and through a Google group, the members of Groundswell—including aides to congressional Republicans—cook up battle plans for their ongoing fights against the Obama administration, congressional Democrats, progressive outfits, and the Republican establishment and ""clueless"" GOP congressional leaders. They devise strategies for killing immigration reform, hyping the Benghazi controversy, and countering the impression that the GOP exploits racism. And the Groundswell gang is mounting a behind-the-scenes organized effort to eradicate the outsize influence of GOP über-strategist/pundit Karl Rove within Republican and conservative ranks. (For more on Groundswell's ""two front war"" against Rove—a major clash on the right—click here.)
At the March 27 meeting, Groundswell participants discussed one multipurpose theme they had been deploying for weeks to bash the president on a variety of fronts, including immigration reform and the sequester: Obama places ""politics over public safety."" In a display of Groundswell's message-syncing, members of the group repeatedly flogged this phrase in public. Frank Gaffney penned a Washington Times op-ed titled ""Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Tom Fitton headlined a Judicial Watch weekly update ""Politics over Public Safety: More Illegal Alien Criminals Released by Obama Administration."" Peter List, editor of LaborUnionReport.com, authored a RedState.com post called ""Obama's Machiavellian Sequestration Pain Game: Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Matthew Boyle used the phrase in an immigration-related article for Breitbart. And Dan Bongino promoted Boyle's story on Twitter by tweeting, ""Politics over public safety?"" In a message to Groundswellers, Ginni Thomas awarded ""brownie points"" to Fitton, Gaffney, and other members for promoting the ""politics over public safety"" riff.
In the interests of copyright I won't post any more. It is a long article and I'll be honest, I haven't got through it all yet myself.
 Saw enough to want you all to get a chance to see it though.
UPDATE:
Hat tip to xxdr zombiexx,
Their ten step evil plan...
1. “At its weekly meetings, the group aims to strengthen the right’s messaging by crafting Twitter hashtags.”
2. Defeat the nomination of Labor Secretary nominee Thomas Perez by convincing people that he is “is extremely antagonistic toward whites.”
3. Convince Americans that John Kerry cannot be trusted as Secretary of State because “Kerry’s son in law is an Iranian American with extensive family still in Iran.”
4. “If we were all gay illegal aliens, the party likes [sic] us.”
5. Re-brand efforts to restrict access to the polls through voter ID programs and strict scrutiny of minority voters as a “Voter Rights” campaign.
6. Win the hearts and minds of “minorities” by re-positioning themselves as “Fredrick Douglas[sic] Republican[s],” instead of tea partiers or conservatives.
7. Refer to immigration reform as “OBAMAGRATION”
8. Hype the “Fast and the Furious” controversy and the Benghazi embassy attack some more.
9. “A 15 sec internet [YouTube ad] featuring ethnically diverse children on a merry-go-round [soft music]… Nuclear explosion.”
10. “Write articles on [sic] 4th grade level!”

Some bristle when words like racist are used here and I understand because I do too. But if you follow the history of Dick Cheney, there is one thing he has not shied away from, is his white supremacy tendencies. Anyone who can publicly denounce Powell, a cabinet officer in his own administration for racist like Limbaugh speaks volumes. Some may say Powell deserves what he get because he a chance to redeem himself but refused to do so. For Cheney Iraqis did not matter. He wanted them annihilated. Do you remember the ""Shock and Awe"" It was intended to maim as many Iraqis they could. Would he advocate ""Shock and Awe"" if we fighting Britain? The answer is no. Yes, the title Racist Dick Cheney fits. And if the shoe fits, Dick should wear it

This is one of many reasons
Chenny was one of four republicans that voted against Mandela

When Rep. Dick Cheney voted against a 1986 resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela and recognition of the African National Congress, Americans did know this man had been waiting decades for his freedom. In a larger sense, so had all black South Africans. The tenets of American democracy -- one man, one vote -- were denied to the majority of citizens, along with the most basic economic and educational needs.



Yet Republican vice presidential candidate Cheney still defends his vote, saying on ABC's ``This Week'' that ``the ANC was then viewed as a terrorist organization. . . . I don't have any problems at all with the vote I cast 20 years ago.'' What, then, does this tell us about what information Cheney considers before he takes a decision? And what the long-term consequences are likely to be, and on whom?


Pete Botha was a renowned racist and for Cheney to support him then speaks for itself.

In fact, while the United States maintained diplomatic ties with South Africa, former President P.W. Botha ordered the 1988 bombing of the South African Council of Churches in Johannesburg. Twenty-three people were injured. For decades, other government operatives did far worse, killing and maiming everyone from political activists to infants.

Here's a NY Times profile on Jerry Brown of CA:
But these days, Mr. Brown — who at 75 is the oldest governor in the nation and about to become the longest-serving governor in the history of California — is enjoying a degree of success and authority he and his opponents could scarcely have imagined when he returned to Sacramento to begin a second tour as governor in 2010.
Republicans usually tout their governors, but that's mostly because they can't tout their Congressional people. How can they, when their entire schtick is ""send me to hated Washington where I swear to do nothing (and less than my predecessor)""?
Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei on how much it sucks to be a Republican these days:
It is almost impossible to find an establishment Republican in town who’s not downright morose about the 2013 that has been and is about to be. Most dance around it in public, but they see this year as a disaster in the making, even if most elected Republicans don’t know it or admit it.
Several influential Republicans told us the party is actually in a worse place than it was Nov. 7, the day after the disastrous election. This is their case:
• The party is hurting itself even more with the very voters they need to start winning back: Hispanics, blacks, gays, women and swing voters of all stripes.
• The few Republicans who stood up and tried to move the party ahead were swatted into submission: Speaker John Boehner on fiscal matters and Sen. Marco Rubio on immigration are the poster boys for this.
• Republicans are all flirting with a fall that could see influential party voices threatening to default on the debt or shut down the government — and therefore ending all hopes of proving they are not insane when it comes to governance.

It’s not about Democracy: Top Ten Reasons Washington is Reluctant to cut off Egypt Aid
Charles A. Kupchan:
Rather than cajoling Cairo to hold elections and threatening to suspend aid if it does not, Washington should press the current leadership to adhere to clear standards of responsible governance, including ending the violence and political repression, restoring the basic functions of the state, facilitating economic recovery, countering militant extremists and keeping the peace with Israel. At this fragile moment in Egypt’s political awakening, the performance of its government will be a more important determinant of its legitimacy and durability than whether it won an election.
More generally, Washington should back off from its zealous promotion of democracy in Egypt and the broader Middle East for three main reasons.

From millions in Cairo’s Tahrir Square two years ago, revolting against Hosni Mubarak’s repressive rule and chanting “Silmiyya, silmiyya” (peaceful, peaceful), to a bloody Wednesday, with hundreds dead and many more wounded as security forces stormed sit-ins by supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi. From a mostly peaceful transition to a violent crackdown. From calls for democracy to a state of emergency.

Who are you going to believe, Karl Rove or your lying eyes?



Who are you going to believe, Karl Rove or your lying eyes?

So Karl Rove and his pals at American Crossroads have a new web video on the Benghazi attack and just like Wednesday's hearing, target number one is Hillary Clinton. It's basically the GOP's 90 second explanation of how Benghazi is going to sink Hillary Clinton in 2016, and as you might expect, facts are the first casualty.
The video begins by claiming Gregory Hicks, the deputy ambassador to Libya, told Secretary of State Clinton on the night of the attack that al Qaeda-linked terrorists were responsible for the violence. The transcript:
VOICEOVER: September 11. Benghazi, Libya. Terrorists linked to al Qaeda kill four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is briefed at 2:00 AM by the Ambassador's deputy that it was, in fact, terrorism.
HICKS: I briefed her on the developments.

For the moment, let's set aside the question of what the implications of this would be if it were an accurate rendition of the facts—because it's not. The reality is that the focus of the 2:00 AM conversation wasn't whether or not the attackers were terrorists, it was about finding Ambassador Stevens and protecting the Americans still in Benghazi. We now know Stevens was already dead, but at the time, Hicks and his State Department colleagues were still searching for him, a fact that Hicks made clear in the rest of his statement:
HICKS: I briefed her on developments. Most of the conversation was about the search for Ambassador Stevens.  It was also about what we were going to do with our personnel in Benghazi, and I told her that we would need to evacuate, and that was -- she said that was the right thing to do.
So while Rove's video claims that Hicks was informing Clinton that that al Qaeda was behind the deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans, the reality is that neither Hicks nor Clinton yet knew that Stevens was dead. Instead, they were trying to find him—and protect other American personnel.
As you might guess, Rove's first distortion was designed to establish the basis for a second distortion: The claim that Clinton personally blamed Benghazi on an internet video despite knowing that it was actually the work of religious extremists. Follow the below fold to continue exploring Rove's attempted sleight-of-hand.


As with the video's first claim, its second claim depends on an apparently damning quote that turns out not to mean what the video says it means.
VOICEOVER: Yet two days later, Secretary Clinton and others blamed protesters and ...
CLINTON (9/14/12): ... an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with.

The video editing is seamless between the voiceover and Clinton, making it appear as though she was finishing his sentence, putting an exclamation point on the claim that she blamed a YouTube video for what happened in Benghazi. But, as with the video's first clip, it turns out that this is just another slice and dice editing job, because as the transcript makes clear, Clinton wasn't talking about Benghazi—she was talking about protests out our embassies in Cairo and other places around the world.
CLINTON (9/14/12): This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful internet video that we had nothing to do with. It is hard for the American people to make sense of that because it is senseless, and it is totally unacceptable.
Clinton's comments about the video were clearly referring to protests and violence at our embassies. Not only was Benghazi not an embassy, Clinton referred to the attack there separately, in the preceding sentence.
At this point in the video, Rove has now told two big whoppers. His goal is to convince viewers that Hillary Clinton was blaming America for what happened in Benghazi and that she refused to stand up to religious extremists simply because they were Muslims. But immediately after the attack, Clinton did exactly that, saying:
Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.
It is especially difficult that this happened on September 11th. It’s an anniversary that means a great deal to all Americans. Every year on that day, we are reminded that our work is not yet finished, that the job of putting an end to violent extremism and building a safe and stable world continues. But September 11th means even more than that. It is a day on which we remember thousands of American heroes, the bonds that connect all Americans, wherever we are on this Earth, and the values that see us through every storm.

What could Rove possibly find objectionable in that statement? The answer is obvious—nothing, because he didn't include it in his video. Instead, he took a statement Clinton had made linking the protest in Cairo to an internet video and falsely claimed she was talking about Benghazi.
Rove wasn't done with his deceptions, however. After the Clinton clip, his video claimed that Hicks was shocked and angered by what Clinton had said:
VOICEOVER: Deputy Hicks was shocked.
HICKS: I was stunned. My jaw dropped. I was embarrassed.

Just one problem: Hicks wasn't talking about his reaction to Hillary Clinton. He was describing his reaction to Susan Rice's Sunday talk show comments. This isn't a surprise: After all, Clinton didn't say what Rove claims she said, so how could he have been?
Rove's video continues:
VOICEOVER: But when Hicks dared to question why Secretary Clinton and others were contradicting the facts he told her, Clinton's Chief of Staff ordered him not to talk to Congress.
Again, this is not true. Hicks says he was told not to talk with Congress without a State Department lawyer present—not that he was told he couldn't talk to Congress. After overlooking that crucial piece of information, the video then makes its closing argument:
A 22-year diplomatic veteran, intimidated for daring to blow the whistle—all under Hillary Clinton's watch. How could this happen? Why did she blame a video? Was she part of a cover up?
The best thing I can say about the closing argument is that by framing its points as rhetorical questions rather than asserting falsehoods as truth, it falls closer to the category of ""bull"" than ""lie.""
Really, the one and only question that is potentially troubling is the question of whether Hicks did face any political repercussions for meeting with Jason Chaffetz without a State Department employee. He says he believes he's been effectively demoted, but the State Department says he hasn't and promised that he won't be. The State Department notes that Hicks asked to end his Libya assignment early and hasn't had his pay reduced by one dime. Hicks, meanwhile, says he still hasn't been reassigned.
It's important to make sure that Hicks is not intimidated for speaking his mind. The fact that he hasn't said anything particularly new or damaging is beside the point. The good news is that he's still employed by the State Department and his salary hasn't been cut one dime. In that respect, he's gotten much better treatment than Shirley Sherrod got after she became the target of a maliciously edited Andrew Breitbart video. But while the administration might not be as trigger happy with Hicks as they were with Sherrod, one thing is clear: If a right-winger puts out a video that's hard to believe, it's pretty damn good bet the video is nothing but lies.

Yesterday the president and Democrats moved their war on Christmas to outrageous new heights. Their attack was sly like a FOX. They conspired to make it look like Christmas happens every year on TV in this country, with the president flipping the lights on the gigantic NATIONAL Xmas tree, followed by a big show of Christmas carols performed by the likes of Mariah Carey and Aretha Franklin and many others. And it was all televised just to make sure everyone was fooled!
It's a travesty the way they all pretend they aren't soldiers in the war to bury what real Christians hold dear. It's beyond nefarious the way the White House is decorated to the nines at Christmas, almost drowning in Christmas---big old gingerbread houses and God knows how many themed Christmas trees---just to make us think there isn't a war on Christmas. The sheer duplicity of it is mind boggling.
Thank God we've got all our corporations to keep Christmas alive! Without them there would be no mall traffic jams, no over extended credit cards, no Christmas sweaters, no ENDLESS Christmas specials on TV, nothing to deck the halls with, and above all, no mouth watering 4th quarter profits.
This is the assault on our freedom that hangs in the balance people. We must find a way to tear off the mask of lies that is this White House's clever attempt to make it look like they aren't hell bent on firing santa, burning Christmas trees to the ground, and sending the elves to socialist camps.
While we fight the good fight to get Obamacare repealed, they fight to repeal Christmas! And in the sneakiest of ways. If you agree, please send money to your favorite republican representative today! With your dollars we can defeat them, and bring back the true meaning of Christmas. Profit. Nothing more American than that, right?!

An illegal alien brutally murdered Laura Wilkerson’s 18-year-old son in Texas, tied his body up, and then doused him with gasoline before burning him. 
Wilkerson recalled the harrowing details on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, yet her story has gone unheard in the broader press.
Maria Espinoza, the director of the Remembrance project that memorializes Americans who were killed by illegal immigrants, told host and Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon that such crimes “happen every day” in America, even in states far from the border. But the mainstream media, Espinoza said, often do not report on illegal immigrants who have murdered Americans in states like Virginia, Tennessee, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington.
Espinoza said incidents remain local ones and are “shared” and actually suppressed. 
“We don’t even hear the person was here illegally in the country,” she said. 
Wilkerson told the harrowing tale of how her 18-year-old son was killed on what started out as “just a normal school day.” Wilkerson’s maternal instinct took over when her son did not answer a text from her around 1:30 pm and she went to the school to look for him. While driving around, Wilkerson saw her son’s truck parked by a dumpster at a strip mall. After police found her son’s backpack and shoes in the dumpster, she suspected the worst.
Wilkerson would later find out that an illegal alien, who would  have been eligible for citizenship under the DREAM Act, brutally murdered her son after he offered to give him a ride home. The illegal alien would later testify–without showing remorse–that he punched her son so hard in the nose that he went blind and kicked him in the stomach so hard that Josh’s liver and spleen sliced. After ultimately strangling Josh to death, the illegal immigrant then tied Josh up, took him to a field, doused him with gas and burned him. The illegal immigrant was sentenced to life in prison this January. 
Espinoza said such crimes were 100% preventable if the nation’s immigration laws are enforced. Wilkerson agreed, recalling how her son’s murder had been in court days before he killed her son because the illegal alien had stalked an ex-girlfriend. Similar incidents have occurred in states like Virginia, where the illegal alien who stabbed a Virginia teenager to death after asking her for a ride to the hospital had been detained months before the murder  
Wilkerson emphasized that the country had to “enforce the laws that are in place and secure the border” so even illegal alien criminals who are deported are not able to just walk back into the country because “our borders are open.”
She sad those like Rep. Steve King (R-IA) who have stood up against illegal immigration “were brave” for doing so and those like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) who have supported comprehensive immigration reform that would grant amnesty to illegal immigrants disgust her. 
“That just makes me sick,” Wilkerson said. “Until it happens to one of their children or their grandkids they are not going to see it the same way.”
Espinoza said the Remembrance Project is engaging in a national campaign to memorializing the victims of illegal immigrants–like Wilkerson’s son–on quilts in every state.
She said Americans needed to tell lawmakers to focus on America, Americans, the debt, and citizens who are out of work. 
“There is absolutely no urgency to address illegal aliens or illegal aliens’s children,” Espinoza said. “They need to focus on American families.”
Wilkerson said her son had dreams of going into the military like his brother and was a “compassionate” and “gentle” kid who “did not have an enemy.” 
But now that her son is gone, Wilkerson said the illegal alien who murdered her son had “more rights than he did.” Because the illegal alien lived in a so-called sanctuary city, Wilkerson recalled that police could not even ask him the immigration status of his parents when they arrested him.
“I don’t understand it at all,” Wilkerson said. "

Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) grilled Defense Sec. Chuck Hagel on a Pentagon email warning Army officers to watch out for soldiers who do not support gay marriage or who disfavor Muslims, equating them with the Ku Klux Klan and Neo-Nazis. 
The Pentagon officer who sent this email reportedly got his information from a radical, leftist anti-Christian organization linked to a convicted terrorist. 
As reported by Fox News’ Todd Starnes, Lt. Col. Jack Rich at Ft. Campbell sent an email warning Army officers to be on the lookout for soldiers connected with “domestic hate groups.” In his 14-page email, Rich identified groups that support traditional marriage or advocate strict border enforcement regarding illegal aliens as domestic hate groups. 
This story is disturbing for several reasons, one of which is this U.S. military email was reportedly using the “domestic hate group” list created by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). This radical-left organization has listed Christian organizations such as the American Family Association and Family Research Council (FRC), immigration reform groups such as FAIR, and various Tea Party organizations as “hate groups.” The SPLC publicly claims they are no different than the KKK and Neo-Nazis, groups that engage in extreme violence and acts of terrorism. 
Yet SPLC has itself now been linked to a domestic terrorist. As we covered in detail, on Aug. 15, 2012, Floyd Corkins attempted to go on a mass-shooting spree at FRC headquarters in Washington, D.C. with 100 rounds of ammunition. Corkins shot building manager Leo Johnson, yet the wounded Johnson disarmed Corkins, who was then captured alive. 
As part of a plea deal, Corkins signed a full confession in which he admitted that he selected his targets from SPLC’s hate group list and used the map SPLC put on its website to find FRC with the intent of murdering everyone in the building (several dozen people). He called himself a political activist and was going to kill everyone in the FRC building because FRC opposes redefining marriage to include gay marriage. 
Corkins was convicted on Feb. 6, 2013, of committing acts of domestic terrorism. 
It is profoundly disturbing that anyone in the U.S. military would use material from such ultra-left zealots, who label organizations that disagree with them on a range of issues–not just social issues like marriage, but also national security issues (immigration) and economic issues (Tea Party groups)–as “hate groups.” 
Yet SPLC is the only group here that has actually been linked to a terrorist, one who was inspired to commit his despicable crime by none other than the same SPLC whose material the Obama administration’s military command is now using. 
The terrible Boston bombing is a reminder what real terrorism looks like. The Obama administration needs to deal with this threat, not associate with radical-fringe organizations that convicted terrorists cite as their enablers.

201,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/19/Fed-court-signals-AZ-Drivers-license,Opinion,Breitbart,Democrat,Federal Court Signals AZ's Denial of Driver's License for Illegals in Trouble,"

U.S. District Judge David Campbell handed both sides a partial victory at the first stage in a case challenging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s executive order that her state will not issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country temporarily under President Barack Obama’s amnesty program of not pursuing deportation for many illegal aliens. But the judge also signaled that Brewer was likely to lose this case in the end, and these illegal aliens will end up with Arizona licenses. 
In 2012 Obama issued an executive order creating his temporary amnesty program. After Congress refused to pass Obama’s proposed DREAM Act on enact an immigration bill granting amnesty to millions of foreigners who entered this country illegally, the president violated his constitutional duty to take care to faithfully execute the law by announcing that he would not deport large groups of illegals that he thinks should receive amnesty. A federal judge is Texas recently held the administration’s actions illegal, but that issue has not yet been resolved on appeal.
In response to Obama’s executive order and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s subsequent halting of deportations, Brewer issued an order to the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles ordering them to stop accepting federal documents from those illegal aliens granted temporary amnesty for purposes of issuing driver’s licenses. An advocacy group for illegal aliens filed a lawsuit challenging Brewer’s actions in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer. 
Brewer filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Brewer’s actions while the lawsuit proceeds. On May 16, Judge Campbell denied both motions. 
Campbell rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Brewer’s order violates the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal law. He correctly reasoned that Obama’s order and Napolitano’s follow-up actions carry no force of law under the Constitution, and therefore do not amount to a federal law that would trump state law.
However, Campbell held it was very likely that the plaintiffs’ alternative argument that Brewer’s order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will ultimately succeed. Although he correctly held that the lowest form of judicial scrutiny–called rational-basis review–is the legal standard for a case like this, he then reasoned that Brewer’s order was likely to fail under even that deferential standard when he issues a final ruling on the merits of this case.
Campbell writes:
 “The Governor’s disagreement with the DACA [amnesty] program may be a rational political or policy view in a broad sense–reasonable people certainly can disagree on an issue as complex and difficult as immigration–but it provides no justification for saying that an Arizona’s driver’s license may be issued to one person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status–say for an individual humanitarian reason–while another person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status under the DACA program is denied a license.”
The court noted that both groups of aliens have their deportation actions deferred through prosecutorial discretion, both have temporary status, both are federally eligible to work, and both have documents that have always been accepted by Arizona for driver’s licenses. Campbell noted that Arizona asserts four bases for why Brewer’s law is rational, but concluded that Brewer’s order blocking one group of illegal aliens from getting licenses, but not the other group, undermined the argument of why her order was reasonably related to advancing the public interests she asserted in court.
Campbell has the pedigree of a conservative judge. A Utah native, he clerked for Justice William Rehnquist (before he became chief justice) on the Supreme Court. The opinion is well-written and gives Brewer her due. It seems unlikely that he will change his mind later in this case, or that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reverse his decision.

The wheels appear to be coming off a two week attempt by the Obama Administration to cover up its fatal security failures at our consulate in Libya and to cover up the very fact that this was a successful pre-planned terrorist attack that cost four American lives, including that of our Libyan Ambassador, Christopher Stevens. 
Not only has the scandal picked up steam in the mainstream press (Jake Tapper’s ABC News report tonight is a must-watch), but high-ranking members of the President’s own party are now demanding answers. This includes the man most often cited as a likely Secretary of State should Obama win a second term, Senator John Kerry:
Senate Democrats joined Republicans Thursday in questioning the Obama administration’s handling of the fatal Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya and why the administration refused for days to acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack linked to al Qaeda.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., circulated a bipartisan letter addressed to Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides, asking for an “accounting of the attacks against U.S. missions in Egypt, Libya and Yemen,” according to a copy obtained by The Washington Examiner. 
The lawmakers are also demanding to know whether the administration had any advance warnings of the Libyan attack and, if so, whether it had shared that information with U.S. personnel on the ground. 
The letter marks the first time congressional Democrats have so directly expressed their dissatisfaction with the administration’s response to inquiries about the attacks, which resulted in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others and raised questions about U.S. security throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. 
A Kerry aide confirmed that the committee intended to enlist the support of Republicans and Democrats and said the letter would likely be sent Friday. Another aide told The Examiner that the panel’s 10 Democrats and nine Republicans plan to sign it.
The false White House narrative blaming the murders on a protest gone bad over a YouTube video never really passed the smell test. But Obama maintained that illusion straight through to his speech before the United Nations two days ago, even as reports surfaced that our government knew al-Qaeda was behind the attack within 24 hours. Apparently, this has become too much to sweep under the rug for some of the mainstream press and Democrats. 
The behavior of Obama and Secretary of State Clinton over the past 14 days is a scandal of the highest order. Lies, cover ups, and neglect for security of American intelligence and personnel that borders on criminal. 
I’ve been skeptical that the same media, that early on conspired in this cover up by intentionally pouring all of its focus and fire on Mitt Romney’s criticism of the Cairo Embassy apology, would go near this before the election. But the sins are so great and glaring, it doesn’t look as though ignoring it will be possible for another 40 days.

203,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/02/20/Benghazi-Survivors-Remained-Gagged-By-Federal-Law,News,Breitbart,Republican,Benghazi Survivors Remain Gagged by Federal Law,"

Many continue to ask why the media and lawmakers have not spoken to or brought forth those who survived the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi last September. The truth of the matter is the Americans who survived that attack cannot legally reveal to members of the press or most lawmakers that they were even witnesses to the attack in Benghazi.
According to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, immediately following the attack, the FBI, as part of the agency’s investigation, interviewed survivors of the Benghazi attack.
Bill Bransford, a Washington, D.C. attorney at Shaw Bransford & Roth P.C. who specializes in federal employment law told Breitbart News on Tuesday, “First of all, I’m assuming that most of these people who witnessed the attack, except for the State Department folks, would be intelligence people, and they are not covered by the whistle blower protection laws.”
Bransford added, “They are covered by whatever policies their agency has. An executive order that President Obama issued in the late fall in which he ordered the intelligence community to come up with a more effective whistle blower protection system, which has not yet been developed.”
However, as federal employees, State Department personnel must sign non-disclosure agreements. Bransford stressed, “If somebody violates one of these non-disclosure agreements, the consequences could include: interfering with a criminal investigation, obstruction of justice, criminal charges for releasing classified information, and those are pretty serious.”
Serious indeed. The Obama administration’s Justice Department has prosecuted more federal employees for leaking information to the press under the 1917 Espionage Act than all other administrations combined. Bloomberg News reported last September:
Lowell, the Washington defense lawyer who has counted as his clients the likes of Jack Abramoff, the former Washington lobbyist, and political figures including former presidential candidate John Edwards, said the Obama administration is using the Espionage Act “like a club” against government employees accused of leaks.
The prosecutions, which Obama and the Justice Department have defended on national security grounds, mean that government officials who speak to the media can face financial and professional ruin as they spend years fighting for their reputations, and, in some cases, their freedom.
Since Breitbart News first broke in December that the Obama administration was hiding Benghazi attack survivors, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) began demanding the FBI hand over to Congress the interviews the agency conducted with individuals who survived the deadly attack.
Senator Graham spoke to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday last weekend about his frustration regarding the issue:
WALLACE: Senator, let me pick up on one of them I find, frankly, quite astonishing. What is the administration’s explanation for the fact the FBI interviewed the survivors, all the Americans who safely got out of Benghazi, right after the attack, months ago, and that they refused to give the transcripts of the interviews to Congress. What’s their explanation for that?
GRAHAM: This is an ongoing criminal investigation is what they told me. We are going back to the law enforcement model, where we’re treating al Qaeda as sort of a mafia, common criminal element rather than enemy combatants.
And here’s what was really stunning, the FBI interviewed the survivors, two days after the attack in Germany and, the CIA never called the FBI for weeks, wanting the results of the interview before they made their assessments — we are going back to the pre-9/11 mentality of — where we treat it as a law enforcement function, and FBI and the CIA never talk to each other, which is very dangerous.
Benghazi was system failure, before, during and after.
Clinton testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January that there were about 25 to 30 survivors and she only spoke to one. Many of the individuals who worked at the U.S. compound were either CIA or State Department employees.
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center is not only heavily guarded on the outside but on the inside as well, some say. In December 2012, visitors to the amputee ward at the NNMMC (Bethesda Hospital) observed what appeared to be Secret Service personnel moving in and out of a closed wing of the floor that was off-limits to everyone else.
According to Fox News, former Senator John Kerry, now Secretary of State, visited Benghazi survivors at Walter Reed on February 4th. Fox News host Greta Van Susteren asked Senator Graham about Kerry’s visit.
I’ve been asking in November, we wrote to the president. The person I blame above all others is President Obama, did you know president Obama, in April or June why wasn’t the Congress informed. They were interviewed two days by the FBI you know the CIA never called up the FBI and say, what did they say about the attack. If you talk to the survivors, you would have known it was a coordinated terrorist attack and not a mob.
Bransford points out that, to the extent that these potential witnesses are State Department employees, they are governed by the whistle blower protection act as modified by the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, which just went into effect six weeks ago. According to Bransford, it does have a provision in it about non-disclosure agreements, but that some of the changes may not yet be in effect because the law is so new and the employee is supposed to be aware of the non-disclosure policies.
For example, it would be consistent with the law on classified information and what they’re allowed to tell Congress. That’s an area that’s kind of brand new and it would only apply to the non-intelligence people–like diplomatic security agents. The FBI probably interviewed them.
It is customary and probably consistent with valid non-disclosure policy to tell somebody who is a witness in an ongoing criminal investigation, which of course the FBI is there, so it’s criminal and counter-terrorism, to tell (witnesses) they are not to discuss the substance of the interview or what they discussed with the investigating agents with anyone. And that would be consistent with a valid non-disclosure policy. So, at this stage, to get (Benghazi survivors) to talk might be tough.
Is there any recourse for Benghazi survivors to ever tell their stories? Certain members of Congress who are authorized to receive information of an ongoing FBI investigation may be these individuals’ only outlets to do so.

He added, “Does that mean that they can’t release it later? Maybe. Meaning there could be some political stuff going on to try and get that information but I’m not sure what’s going to happen with that.”
Senator Charles Grassley (R – IA), the co-author of the Whistle Blower Protection Enhancement Act sent a statement to Breitbart News on the law:
Unfortunately, whistleblower protection laws are necessary. We’ve seen far too many people who are shunned to a corner, or worse, for simply trying to do the right thing by exposing wrongdoing within the federal government. The Whistleblower Protection Act allows a federal employee to come to Congress, or others as designated by Congress, and provide information about wrongdoing, including waste, fraud and abuse of government programs. There are additional protections for whistleblowers who come forward to Congress, such as the Lloyd-Lafollette Act and the Anti-Gag statute. By coming to a member of Congress, we can create a formal record of the protected correspondence between the member and the whistleblower which should serve as a reminder to the federal agency that actions of retaliation are against the law."

Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission for the United States in Libya, and the top US official in Libya after the September 11, 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks, testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee today – and he told Congress that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department lawyers tried to stop him from talking to Congresspeople investigating. “I was instructed not to allow the RSO [Regional Security Officer], the acting deputy chief of mission and myself to be personally interviewed by Congressman [Jason] Chaffetz [of Utah],” said Hicks. 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) couldn’t believe what he was hearing: “So the people at State told you, ‘Don’t talk to the guy who is coming to investigate?'” Hicks’ answer: “Yes, sir.” Jordan pressed: “You’ve had several congressional delegations come to various places you’ve been around the world. Has that ever happened, where lawyers get on the phone to you prior to a congressional delegate coming to investigate … Have you ever had anyone tell you, ‘Don’t talk with the people from Congress coming to find out what took place?” Hicks: “Never.”
Jordan then asked Hicks whether a lawyer from State had been sent with Hicks when the Congressional delegation arrived – whether State had forced a minder on Hicks. “Yes, sir, that’s true,” said Hicks. Hicks went on to describe a classified briefing he had with Rep. Chaffetz in Libya: “The lawyer was excluded from the meeting because his clearance was not high enough, and the delegation had insisted that the hearing not be limited.” Hicks stated that the lawyer attempted to get into the briefing anyway, and the annex chief would not allow it. 
After that meeting, Hicks was called by Cheryl Mills, counselor for the State Department and staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mills was deputy White House counsel under the Clinton administration, and she was termed the “shining star of the defense team” for President Clinton’s Senate impeachment trial. Jordan described Mills as “as close as you can get to Secretary Clinton.” Hicks told the story: “A phone call from that … person is generally not considered to be good news …. She demanded a report on the visit … She was upset … She was very upset.”

Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News over the weekend that the Obama administration is telling individuals who were rescued during the deadly Benghazi attack last September to be quiet about what they know. 
Graham said he “had contact” with survivors and described their accounts as “chilling.” “The bottom line is they feel that they can’t come forth, they’ve been told to be quiet.”
White House Press Secretary Jay Carney refuted that the administration is gagging survivors, telling Fox News last week, “I’m sure that the White House is not preventing anyone from speaking,”
Graham does not buy it and is threatening to hold up all business in the upper chamber if the White House does not release the names of the survivors to Congress. Graham is urging his colleagues in the House to move forward and issue subpoenas of Benghazi survivors if the administration fails to release any information on them. 
“To our leadership in the House, you’re gonna have to up your game on Benghazi,” the South Carolina Republican said. 
Breitbart News first reported in December that Congressman Jason Chaffetz  (R-UT) was being stonewalled by the Obama administration from visiting the injured survivors of the Benghazi attack. 
Since then, Senator Graham has demanded the FBI turn over the interviews with the survivors to no avail. Graham, Senators John McCain (R-AZ), and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) all called for a joint select committee to investigate the Benghazi assault, while Congressman Frank Wolf (R-VA) re-issued a second resolution to form a House Select committee to do the same. 
Wolf and Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-PA) demanded Sec. Kerry to hand over the contact information of all the State Department employees who worked at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi when the attack occurred. Wolf’s resolution currently boasts over 60 co-sponsors.
Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, and Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, are looking forward to hear from Benghazi survivors as well.
“We’ll get our chance to talk to Benghazi survivors and get the reports from the FBI. That will happen. I’m confident of that,” Chairman Rogers told Breitbart News. “We want to make sure people have a chance to heal first and we’ll have an opportunity to talk these people before this is over. I’m fairly comfortable this will happen,” he said.
Chairman Issa noted that Secretary of State John Kerry’s visit to a Benghazi survivor opened the door for Congress to question anyone who was on the ground and survived the Benghazi attack. “We expected to speak with all the witnesses and the Benghazi survivors,” he told Breitbart News. “Now that Secretary Kerry has publicly, essentially a senator, in a post way, has chosen to visit with them, any claim that they’re not available at this point to Congress is unsupportable. And I look forward to oversight by all committees.” 
Any Benghazi survivor who talks to his committee would be protected from prosecution or job termination from the Obama administration, Rogers said. “We’ll make sure of that. That is whistle bower standard protection. If they’re fired for talking to us, there’ll be some hell to pay.”
Issa agrees, saying, “Any kind of retaliation against any of the witnesses we’ve already had would not be tolerated.” 
Four Americans were killed on site when the U.S. mission in Benghazi was attacked, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens. Questions remain, however, as to the physical health of those who were evacuated from the U.S. compound. Rogers cannot confirm if any evacuee later succumbed to their injuries while being treated at medical facilities.
The Michigan Republican explained, “Like I said, I don’t know. We’ll know before it’s over. My review is not over yet. We’re looking at all the information. We still have cables and emails that we still haven’t gone through one hundred percent yet. It’s voluminous.”  He added, “Were going through it painstakingly. I’m just an old FBI guy, so I’m going through it painstakingly to find to find the truth. My goal is to find the truth. And wherever those facts and leads takes us.”"

Wow, wow, wow.  Former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates just issued a beat-down of epic proportion on Face the Nation.  Here's a sample from: http://www.cbsnews.com/...
1. On the charges that the administration did not do enough to prevent the tragedy in Benghazi:
""It's sort of a cartoonish impression of military capabilities and military forces,"" he said. ""The one thing that our forces are noted for is planning and preparation before we send people in harm's way, and there just wasn't time to do that.""
2. Regarding how he would have handled the attack if he was in charge:
""Frankly, had I been in the job at the time, I think my decisions would have been just as theirs were.""
3. Regarding why we didn't send in some ready forces:
""We don't have a ready force standing by in the Middle East, and so getting somebody there in a timely way would have been very difficult, if not impossible.""
4. What about the dumbest idea of all (my words) of sending in fighter jets to ""scare"" away the attackers:
""I would not have approved sending an aircraft, a single aircraft, over Benghazi under those circumstances.""
5. Regarding sending in a small group of ""special forces.""
""Send some small number of special forces or other troops in without knowing what the environment is, without knowing what the threat is, without having any intelligence in terms of what is actually going on on the ground, would have been very dangerous.""
6. Regarding going to war with Syria:
""Why should it be us?"" Gates asked.
If anything, he said, we could carefully select elements in Syria who align with American values and interests and ""provide them with intelligence, with basic military equipment.""
""But I think our direct involvement and particularly our direct military involvement would be a mistake.""

 
I could go on and on but now I guess you see the picture:
Gates confirmed that these right-wing nuts are nuts.

Well, if it is Thursday, there must be a new Obama scandal. But one thing is for damn sure: whatever that scandal is, you can bet the American mainstream media will be playing catch up and not having the glory of breaking a story about a major White House scandal. 
Fact: Over the past few weeks, four major scandals have broken over the Obama administration, and it is a very sad (and frightening) truth that our pathetic, American, lapdog mainstream media are not responsible for breaking even a single one. 
Verizon? Nope, not our guys. That was the Brits over at The Guardian.  
IRS? Nope, not our guys. The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question. 
The Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records? Nope, not our guys. Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn’t even break that story. Like the IRS, we only found out because the Justice Department outted itself in a letter notifying the AP of what it had done. 
Benghazi? Are you kidding. With a couple of rare exceptions (Jake Tapper, Sharyl Attkisson) the media have spent the last eight months attacking those seeking the truth (Congress, Fox News)–not seeking the truth. It was the GOP congress that demanded the email exchanges concerning the shaping of the talking points, not the media. 
Left up to the media, we wouldn’t know anything about Libya. All of the media’s energy was collectively poured into ensuring the truth was never discovered. 
And do you want to know what makes this realization especially pathetic? In three of the four scandals (the AP being the exception), had our media been less interested in protecting Power and more interested in holding Power accountable, these huge, career-making stories were right there for the taking. 
For over a year now, conservative Tea Party groups have been complaining about IRS harassment. But because Obama told them to, the media hate the Tea Party. So in the face of these complaints and even a few Congressional inquiries, the media either ignored the harassment reports or openly sided with the IRS. (No joke. Click the link.)
Obviously, you can say the same about Libya. All the dots were there to connect: Security failures, two weeks of lies, the midnight arrest of some hapless filmmaker… But rather than connect the dots, the media played goalie for Obama against Fox News and Darrell Issa. Besides, there was a re-election to win and Todd Akin got something wrong about The Womanparts. 
Moreover, there are still plenty of dots to connect about Libya. But the new SQUIRREL is OVERREACH, and already the lapdogs are back in goalie formation. 
As for the Verizon story, members of Congress, specifically Democrat Senators Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), have been hint-hint-wink-winking to the media that something is horribly amiss going back to December:
In a Senate floor speech in December, Wyden hinted at classified information he had received but could not share due to Senate rules that indicated the law “on Americans’ privacy has been real, and it is not hypothetical.”
“When the public finds out that these secret interpretations are so dramatically different than what the public law says, I think there’s going to be extraordinary anger in the country,” he told The Huffington Post the following month.
That is from today’s Politico report on the Verizon scandal. Apparently, Politico knew of this back in December but had all their investigative researchers digging into why those short-skirted Tea Partiers had it coming, so they missed another one of the biggest stories of the year. 
Politico shouldn’t feel bad, though, because when it comes to missing the four biggest scoops of the Obama administration, they have plenty of lazy, lapdog, sycophant company in that department. 
Our media are not only biased; it is an utter and complete failure and embarrassment. And although there are plenty of remaining table scraps to make meals out of, the media are already losing interest in the IRS, Libya, and AP scandals, but for only one reason–they are absolutely terrified of where they might lead. 
During the Bush years, it was the New York Times, Washington Post and Sy Hersh breaking story  after story after story about the White House. And yes, some of that reporting was–ahem –overreach, but at least Power knew it was being watched; our democracy was safe because an overzealous media  is what you call a luxury problem. 
Today, it is the complete opposite, and the result is an administration run amok. 
Get down on your knees and thank your Maker for conservative New Media, Roger Ailes, and for the few true liberals left in the media, like Glenn Greenwald–who works for the Brits.

Decrying yesterday’s filibuster of the confirmation of former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) as Secretary of Defense, the White House and the media have decided to target his critics, especially Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Yet they should welcome the extension of debate, which provides an opportunity for Senators who once expressed concerns, such as Chuck Schumer (D-NY), to revisit their conclusions in light of new information.
The case for Hagel remains exceedingly weak. Some Democrats claim that he has the necessary qualifications to lead the Pentagon, but not even the Obama-friendly Politico supports that argument, noting Jan. 31 that Hagel’s main qualification was “politician.” Hagel’s supporters keep citing his admirable military record, but it is not a qualification for a primarily civilian post which requires an intimate knowledge of defense policy.
Hagel, by his own admission, does not know much about the Department of Defense. During his two terms in in the Senate, he served on the Foreign Relations Committee, not the Armed Services Committee. He has some broad views about how the country’s defenses ought to change, but these are shifting, and vague. He has argued both for and against defense cuts, for example, and does not understand the defense sequester.
The case against Hagel, on the other hand, grows stronger every day. From a left-wing point of view, his weaknesses were obvious from the start. He had expressed hostile views toward gays and supported “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He had led the fight to block climate change from moving through the Senate, and would now be stepping in to lead a Pentagon that has committed in recent years to the use of green fuels and technology.
Hagel also had subscribed to the slate of socially conservative views demonized by the Democrats as a “war on women,” such as opposition to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother. The Armed Services Committee also quietly examined criticisms about how Hagel had dealt with allegations of sexual harassment among members of his staff–a bad sign when the military is trying to stamp out such abuse.
For Democrats, an additional irritation was that Hagel’s nomination sent a signal that the party still lacked the self-confidence to run the Pentagon. As Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos wrote in December: 
Hagel is a Republican who voted for all of George W. Bush’s pet wars….And yes, while he has reneged on his past support for our nation’s disastrous wars, there are plenty of good qualified Democrats who weren’t idiotic enough to support them in the first place.  
It’s time for Democrats to embrace the fact that yes, they know what the hell they’re doing on matters of national security.
The only case for Hagel, from a left-wing perspective, was that the “neoconservatives”–i.e. those who favored a dominant military, an assertive foreign policy, and a strong U.S.-Israel alliance–were opposed to him. Hagel’s nomination offered the anti-war movement, especially its anti-Israel elements, a chance to shift the debate in their favor.
The Obama administration worked hard to prevent Democrats from defecting, sending Hagel to consult with Schumer and to write regretful letters to the likes of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), expressing regret for having used such phrases such as “Jewish lobby” and reassuring her of his commitment to carry out President Barack Obama’s policies, with which his own previous views were in apparent conflict on a variety of subjects.
But the administration could not head off Republican queries, especially as more new information about Hagel’s past positions, much of it unearthed by the conservative new media, began to surface. Even the mainstream media began to take a skeptical view, with editorials opposing Hagel in both the Washington Post and the Chicago Tribune.
The principal worry was Hagel’s views on Iran. Not only had Hagel opposed the use of military force, if necessary, to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, but he had also opposed the use of sanctions. He had also advocated “engaging” the Tehran regime, which to this day shows no interest in direct talks. Hagel’s appointment was therefore a sign of weakness in opposing Iran–the worst possible signal at the worst possible time.
Hagel’s views on Israel were also troubling–not least because of their implications for the American military. He had opposed designating Iranian-backed Hezbollah as a terror group, and advocated U.S. talks with Hamas in Gaza. He also denounced Israel’s war of self-defense against Hezbollah in 2006, calling it “disproportionate” and equating it with terror against Israeli civilians, undermining the basis of the U.S. war against terror.
Much controversy centered around Hagel’s use of the term “Jewish lobby,” a misnomer that implies Jewish control over U.S. foreign policy, and which was in vogue among the extreme left at the time as a scapegoat for the war in Iraq. Hagel now says that he misspoke, but new allegations that he claimed in 2007 that Israel controlled the U.S. State Department reinforce worries that he may have entertained antisemitic bias.
Perhaps the most self-destructive position Hagel had previously adopted was support for global nuclear disarmament, including the specific idea that the U.S. should begin to disarm unilaterally if necessary. In his confirmation hearing, Hagel attempted to deny that he had endorsed that view, but patient cross-examination by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) demonstrated that Hagel had, in fact, affixed his name to that radical suggestion. 
The most recent nuclear test by North Korea, the ongoing atrocities by a Syrian regime that Hagel once suggested the U.S. should court, the continued belligerence of Iran and persistent terrorism by Hamas are all evidence that Hagel’s views on defense and foreign policy were naive at best, and dangerous at worst. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) also took Hagel to task for his strident opposition to the successful surge in Iraq.
In his confirmation hearing, Hagel not only failed to defend his views, but failed to show familiarity with the official policies of the administration he hoped to enter, mistakenly referring to a policy of “containment” with Iran and describing the Tehran regime as a “legitimate” government. Having failed to demonstrate that his recent shifts on several issues were sincere, he meekly asserted that his own views on policy would not matter.
The problem with Hagel’s performance at the hearing was not just that he stumbled, but that he dissembled, making a number of assertions that were shown to be untrue. Hagel also failed to provide more than four of the “hundreds” of speeches he had given in previous years, and explained that he had “given the committee every copy of every speech that I have that’s out there, every video that I have that’s out there.”
Yet in the days that followed, several speeches emerged about which Hagel had not informed the committee, including some within the five-year timeframe that members of the committee had requested. Hagel and the Obama administration maintained that these speeches had been “informal,” but the fact that Hagel spoke extemporaneously did not make the speeches any less official, as video of one such speech confirmed.
Hagel also refused to provide complete information about possible sources of possible foreign income over the past five years, particularly indirect compensation he may have received through organizations or funds with which he has been affiliated. The Atlantic Council, which he chairs, is known to have accepted large donations from the Hariri family, which is active in Lebanese politics and supportive of the Hamas organization. 
After missing the deadline that Senators had imposed for disclosure, Hagel provided a list of foreign government and corporate donors to the Atlantic Council. He refused to provide additional information, saying he could not force other organizations to do the same. Democrats charged that Republicans were holding Hagel to an unprecedented standard; Republicans cited Democrats’ own demands that Henry Kissinger provide a list of his firm’s clients when he was nominated to the 9/11 commission, as well as the case of Hillary Clinton, who released a list of foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation.
It was Hagel’s refusal to come clean–and his evident attempts to evade transparency–that ultimately united the Republican caucus in the Senate behind a filibuster, including some members who had initially expressed strong reservations about using the tactic.
The resulting delay will provide the Senate with several more days in which to consider Hagel’s candidacy, and for the White House to consider other options. The very fact that Hagel’s nomination has proved so divisive, and has exposed so many weaknesses in the nominee, is itself an argument for withdrawal. In a time of rising threats and looming budget challenges, the Pentagon will not be served by a perception of weak leadership.
Any one of the many factors above should, by itself, have disqualified Hagel from even being considered for the post. But President Obama has thrown out the rules many times before in his quest to transform America. Hagel is, in a sense, the Obamacare of Cabinet nominations: a deeply problematic policy choice that may have the votes to pass but lacks broad public support and may ultimately cost far more than advertised.
The Republican filibuster may hold; it may not. But if even a few Democrats make the right choice–the kind of well-considered choice made by moderate Sen Susan Collins (R-ME), for example–then Hagel’s nomination will collapse on the merits. If they are honest with themselves, Democrats must admit that they would not even think about confirming Hagel except for the fact that Obama has staked his political capital on it.
The left’s attacks on Sen. Cruz, on conservative media, and on pro-Israel activists may serve the president’s political interests. He relishes opportunities to paint the opposition as intransigent. Yet the Hagel nomination is a good example of why the filibuster is necessary as a restraint on the majority, a way to help it correct its mistakes before they become irrevocable. Obama and his party have one last chance to do the right thing."

Under the Gang of 8’s backroom immigration deal with Senators Schumer, Corker and Hoeven, formerly illegal immigrants who are amnestied will be eligible to work, but will not be eligible for ObamaCare. Employers who would be required to pay as much as a $3,000 penalty for most employees who receive an ObamaCare healthcare “exchange” subsidy, would not have to pay the penalty if they hire amnestied immigrants. 
Consequently, employers would have a significant incentive to hire or retain amnestied immigrants, rather than current citizens, including those who have recently achieved citizenship via the current naturalization process.
The issue is really an “interaction effect” of the immigration proposal and ObamaCare itself.  
Beginning in January, businesses with 50 or more full-time employees, that do not currently offer healthcare benefits that are considered “acceptable” by the Obama administration, must pay a penalty if at least one of their workers obtains insurance on a new government-run “exchange.” The penalty can be as much as $3,000 per employee.  
Many employers have been preparing to cope with the new regulations by slashing the hours of full-timers to part-time status. Since “full-time,” in the language of ObamaCare, is averaging 30 hours per week, employers will, in general, receive the penalty if they have 50 or more employees who are working an average of 30 hours per week.  
If the immigration bill becomes law, many employers could receive incentives of hundreds of thousands of dollars to hire amnestied immigrants over American citizens. In addition, these newly legalized immigrants could work “full-time,” an advantage for companies and businesses as well, while employers could lay off or diminish to “part-time” status, American workers. 
Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner explains that he spoke with Alex Conant of Sen. Marco Rubio’s staff in April about the wrinkle, and was told that this was an issue that could be addressed during the legislative process. 
“[T]he scenario you raise illustrates both the absurdity of ObamaCare, and why we have insisted on a lengthy process to review this legislation before any votes are taken,” Conant emailed Klein. “We always expected there might be a need for amendments to fix technical problems, and we’ll be interested in seeing what sort of amendments might be offered to improve this part of the legislation without giving ObamaCare to illegals- something Sen. Rubio has always said he will not support.” 
However, as Klein said a couple of weeks ago, the issue has not been addressed and, in fact, the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven deal carries out what appears to be a major complication for American workers. Klein said that Conant did not respond to further requests for comment on this issue.  
As for Conant’s comment in April about Rubio insisting on a “lengthy process to review this legislation before votes are taken,” that seems to have gone with the wind as well."
212,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/09/02/clintons-former-syria-advisor-slams-obama-handling-of-crisis,News,Breitbart,Republican,Clinton's Syria Advisor Slams Obama's 'Strategically Appalling' Response,"

Fred Hof, the career diplomat who led the US response for much of the Syrian crisis, slammed President Obama this weekend for his “strategically appalling” response to Syria’s alleged use of chemical weapons. Hof, who last year was tasked by then Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Obama to lead US negotiations to resolve Syria’s civil war, said Obama’s last-minute switch to seek Congressional approval for a military strike in Syria undermined US authority in the world.
“By not making it clear from the outset of the crisis that he would seek the approval of the Senate and House for a military response to the Assad regime’s chemical atrocity,” Hof wrote, “the president’s jarring change of direction now runs the risk of thoroughly undermining whatever remains of allied confidence in his leadership.”
Hof writes that, “the events of the past ten days suggest that there was no administration forethought to the possibility of a major chemical incident in Syria; there was no plan in place to respond to a major chemical attack by a regime that had already demonstrated its deep and abiding contempt for the president and his red lines.”
Hof argues that Obama’s recent actions would lead many to believe that the decision to seek Congressional approval “is less a bow to American constitutionality than a further attempt to kick the can down the road.”
Obama didn’t seek Congressional approval for the military action he authorized in Libya. That action was directed at toppling the regime of Libyan dictator Gadaffi, a more intense and much broader objective than Obama says he wants in Syria. In his remarks on Saturday, Obama even stated that he believes he has the authority to order a strike on Syria. That he didn’t, Hof argues, nor call Congress immediately back to Washington, undermines US credibility in the world. 
Hof is not some outside expert observing the seen from afar. He joined the Obama Administration at the start of the President’s first term as a special advisor of the Middle East. He worked closely with Clinton and Special Envoy George Mitchell on Middle East peace negotiations. He was the lead diplomat for issues related to Syria and Lebanon. 
In March, 2012, President Obama elevated him to the rank of Ambassador and gave him responsibility for handling the US response to the deteriorating situation in Syria. He abruptly resigned the position just 6 months later. News of his resignation came just two works after the murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya. 
Hof’s critique of the Obama Administration is must reading for anyone trying to understand America’s increasingly feckless response to the events unfolding in Syria. Almost a year ago, President Obama told reporters that Syria’s use of chemical weapons was a “red line” that, if crossed would generate a US military response. It seems inconceivable that no contingency plans were draw up for just such an event. Yet, as Hof argues, that seems to be the case. 
Congress doesn’t return to Washington until next week. Even if strong support builds for military intervention, it will likely be several days before Congress approves action. This gives the Assad regime at least two weeks to prepare for any possible US attack. The regime is no doubt, even today, moving its chemical weapons arsenal to unknown locations. The limited engagement Obama claims he wants may be completely ineffective. 
As Hof laments, “there will be no ‘do-overs.'”

213,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/11/26/Valerie-Jarrett-Chicago-and-the-Iran-Deal,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,"Valerie Jarrett, Chicago, and the Iran Deal","
Last week, the Times of Israel reported that senior presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett had been leading talks with Iran in secret for a year before the formal negotiations in Geneva this month. While the White House denied the report “100 percent,” the existence of back-channel talks has been confirmed by other reporting. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that President Barack Obama had “personally overseen” the talks.
Almost anything “personally overseen” by the President Obama is likely to bear the heavy stamp of Ms. Jarrett, who is the president’s closest adviser, despite a shocking track record of failure. In foreign policy, her most important mistake was her effort to dissuade the president from proceeding with the raid on Osama bin Laden. It was one of the few times that President Obama overruled her counsel–and one of his few successes.
Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is cause for concern for three additional reasons–two minor and one major. One minor reason is that she was born there. That should not automatically disqualify anyone, of course, any more than being born in the Soviet Union would have disqualified an anti-Soviet dissident. But Jarrett was born in 1956 to American expatriates in the aftermath of the CIA-assisted coup that deposed Mohammad Mossadegh.
The Iranian regime remains obsessed with the Mossadegh coup as proof of America’s innate evil–and for decades, some Americans have felt a sense of post-colonial guilt about it. That feeling may be particularly acute for an American born in the shadow of that event. The temptation to show contrition by acceding to Iran’s goals, as a kind of restorative justice, could well shape Jarrett’s involvement, and Obama’s approach.
The second minor reason to worry about Jarrett’s involvement in Iran is her political background. Her entrée into the world of left-wing politics in Chicago was through her father-in-law, Vernon Jarrett, a journalist with somewhat radical views. Jarrett spoke out against antisemitism in the black community, for example, but also took anti-Israel stands, accusing pro-Israel Jews of “support of genocide” in the Lebanon War, for example.
These two reasons for concern are fairly minor, because they are based on mere speculation, and would have to be balanced out by other factors, such as Ms. Jarrett’s personal associations with leaders of the pro-Israel community in Chicago. But the major reason for concern about her role is simply that Jarrett has banished, and repulsed, most of the Obama administration’s most competent appointees from the White House.
One of the most important departures was that of Dennis Ross, who was brought into the White House early in the Obama presidency to advise the president on the Middle East. Ross, who advocated a tough approach to Iran, is widely thought to have been marginalized by the president’s inner circle. He left the White House in 2011, ostensibly because he had only promised to serve two years, but likely because he was not being utilized.
Finally, it is worth noting that Jarrett, despite her expatriate origins, has little experience in international affairs, and is said to manage Obama’s policies through a domestic political lens. If she was as involved in the talks as reports suggest, that could be a major reason for the president’s eagerness to sign almost any deal, even one the French rejected as too weak. In any other administration, she likely would have been ignored."
214,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/18/Poll-Over-Two-Thirds-Back-Investigations-Into-Benghazi-IRS-Scandal,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,"Poll: Over Two-Thirds Back Investigations Into Benghazi, IRS Scandal","

The President of the United States might not believe there is any “there” there regarding his administration’s now-admitted mishandling of the September 11 terror attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but a new Gallup poll seems to indicate the America people aren’t quite as sure. A full 52% “strongly agree” that Benghazi is a “serious issue that needs to be investigated,” while 17% “agree.” That’s a total of 69%. 
Because the mainstream media has conspired (it must be noted that there are a number of notable individual exceptions) with the White House over the last eight months to downplay Libya, you might think that particular scandal would generate less interest than the IRS scandal — which the media have taken much more seriously. Surprisingly, though, the numbers aren’t all that different. When asked the same question about the IRS, 56% “strongly agree” and 18% “agree;” for a total of 74% — which is only 5 points higher than Libya. 
The numbers for Libya create a real dilemma for the White House and its lapdog media. The no there “there” Narrative they have spent eight months manufacturing obviously isn’t working. Moreover, the motive behind this Narrative is a sinister one: neither Obama nor his media want the truth to get out, and both know that the more the people learn about the administration’s handling of Libya, the worse it will be for the administration. 
For instance, with the release of the 94 emails earlier this week, we now know for a fact that the White House repeatedly lied with their claim that the administration played no role in shaping the CIA talking points. The media, though, refuse to hold the White House accountable for that lie and prefer to pretend the emails actually do back the administration’s claim.  
The main reason the media have smothered the damning revelations found in the emails, though, is to protect Hillary Clinton. It was the State Department that demanded what amounted to almost a total rewrite of the completed talking points, and won them. But the media see Hillary as the best chance they have for keeping the White House out of Republican hands in 2016, and so they are circling the wagons for her, just like they have for Obama for the last five years.  
Plus, even though the media isn’t demanding more, we still don’t have all the information regarding the shaping of the talking points. These information gaps are critical, and to say we should take the White House’s word for anything at this point is a joke. 
The media are also ignoring and smothering the effort to find out who gave the order to “stand down” when it came to sending help to Americans under attack that night. And when it comes to finding out what exactly the President was doing during those horrific hours during which the attack took place, the media is laughably uncurious.   
To protect the White House from having to reveal the truth, the President and his media have developed a strategy that smears as partisan witch-hunters anyone searching for the truth. This includes any Republican in Congress pushing for investigations and, naturally, Fox News. 
But from the looks of this poll, the witch-hunters have the will of the people on their side–a whopping 69% of them. That’s a huge number, but if you think about, not really a surprising one. When Americans die, decent people believe everything should be fully investigated and made public. 
The American people are, by and large, decent. 
This White House and its media, however, are not. 
Hopefully this poll will only further embolden the GOP and Fox News and the exceptions in the media to continue to do the decent thing: Find and tell the complete truth about what led to the deaths of an ambassador and three other Americans.

Last night, Jon Stewart looked at how John Kerry ""lucked"" into possibly resolving the Syria situation without having to go to war, and tore into Fox News for their reaction to this potential good news.
We got into this pickle from an ill-thought out hypothetical statement, a red line.  So perhaps the only way out is with an equal and opposite ill-thought out hypothetical statement, according to Newton's theory of relative stupidity.  But what kind of Magoo-esque accidental genius could bumblefuck their way into diplomatic success?  (picture of John Kerry)  ""Hello!""  (audience laughter)
It's John Kerry to the rescue!  Secretary Kerry!  In the middle of presenting Kerry's slam dunk case for why we absolutely, positively, must attack Syria, he inadvertently may have found an internationally acceptable peaceful resolution.
9/9/2013:
REPORTER: Is there anything at this point that his government could do or offer that would stop an attack?
JOHN KERRY: Uh, sure.  He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week, turn it over.  All of it.  Without delay.  And allow a full and total accounting for that.  But he isn't about to do it, and it can't be done, obviously.

Can't be done!  Can't!  It's never going to happen!  No way!  Can't be done!  And just to drive the point home as to how ridiculous this possibility was:
BRET BAIER (9/9/2013): The State Department quickly called that a rhetorical argument and not a real proposal from Kerry.
They had to make a separate announcement to say, ""Hey by the way, he was just being condescending.  And sarcastic.""
Well, guess which Middle Eastern despot doesn't appear to understand rhetorical devices.
BROOKE BALDWIN (9/9/2013): Syria's foreign minister says the country ""welcomes"" a proposal to put its chemical weapons under international control.
Magoo, you've done it again!
(video of Mr. Magoo unknowingly escaping death from a tiger)
Holy shit!  Syria is taking him up on his dickish offer!  Syria, through the auspices of Vladimir Putin's Russia, would like to take the international community and Secretary Kerry's generous offer to hold their weapons for them.  No war, no costs, no blowback!  How could any patriot view this as anything but a fantastic development?
STUART VARNEY (9/10/2013): President Obama has just led us into a humiliating defeat.
Defeat?!  Who did we lose to??  Sanity??  You beat us this time, rational forethought.  But we'll get you.
Who cares how we avoided a war and got a dictator to give up his chemical weapons, if we avoided a war and got a dictator to give up his chemical weapons?
TUCKER CARLSON (9/9/2013): This strengthens Russia and humiliates the United States.
SEAN HANNITY (9/9/2013): Now Vladimir Putin has filled the leadership gap.
CNBC ANCHOR (9/10/2013): I think Lindsey Graham's on the tape saying that the Russians have played us like a fiddle.
FOX BUSINESS ANALYST (9/9/2013): They are now the new cop of the world, and we're not.  It's despicable.
GRETCHEN CARLSON (9/10/2013): Now have we handed the power back over to the shirtless Putin?

OK, two things.  One, was that guy in a cow suit?

I don't really understand financial news.  And #2, ohh, Putin gets the credit.  If we caught Charlie Manson, who gives a shit who gets the collar?
And I get that Fox opposes a Syria peace plan because its modus operandi is to foment dissent in the form of a relentless and irrational contrarianism to Barack Obama on all things democratic, to advance its ultimate objective of creating a deliberately misinformed body politic whose fear, anger, mistrust, and discontent is the manna upon which it sustains its parasitic succubus-like existence.  (MASSIVE audience cheering and applause)
And uh, but....  Sorry, I blacked out for a second, was I saying something?
But for some reason, even CNN's Chris Cuomo seemed disappointed with the turn of events.
CHRIS CUOMO (9/10/2013): A Russian proposal to have Syria hand over its chemical weapons could change what the President has to say, could change the entire debate.  But should it?
Should it?  Yeah, on the one hand, geopolitical reality just shifted 100%, but on the other hand, we built this graphic.

Look, cuz isn't that the problem now?  News networks aren't invested in right or wrong, they're invested in momentum.  Ah, you can take us to war on false intelligence and pretense, but God forbid you rev us up for war, and you don't deliver.  The one thing we won't tolerate in this country is a little war foreplay without the payoff.  You can make disastrous foreign policy decisions, but you will not give this country a case of blue bombs.  We'll be right back.

A staff report prepared for Rep. Darrell Issa and released today finds numerous failings in the ARB report on Benghazi released last year. The new report overturns some of the conclusions of the official ARB report. It finds that Under Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy, who was not criticized in the ARB report, should have been held accountable.
The new report is based on public statements but also on transcripts of numerous interviews undertaken since the release of the ARB report. It concurs with some portions of the earlier ARB report and disputes others. For instance, the new report finds that Charlene Lamb was at fault for decisions she made with regard to security in Libya. However the new report also provides a partial basis for exonerating Lamb since evidence suggests that every personnel decisions related to Libya was directly approved (or disapproved) by Under Secretary Kennedy. 
A key exchange appears on page 63 of the report when Committee staff interview Deputy Assistant Secretary for Maghreb Affairs Maxwell about the involvement of Under Secretary Kennedy in events taking place in Libya prior to the 9/11 attack [Emphasis in original]:
Q.The DCM, Mr. Hicks, testified that Ambassador Kennedy was very engaged on a minute level about the incidents that were occurring in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks.
A.Yep.
Q. Does that surprise you?
A. It does not.  We–one of the things that I found interesting was that the Under Secretary approved every person that went in or came out of Tripoli…
*   *   *
A. The DAS Assistant Secretary reports to the Under Secretary for Management. The way the Under Secretary for Management runs things, there is no decision that DS makes that doesn’t have his input and his imprimatur, his approval. There is no decision that DS doesn’t make that doesn’t have his disapproval. DS–the Under Secretary for Management speaks for DS for all practical purposes, and there is no decision that DS makes that the Under Secretary for Management is not involved in.
Q.So, the important decisions about the security posture in Libya leading up to the attacks, if Mr. Boswell was held accountable for those decisions, is it fair to say that the Under Secretary for Management would have had a role in those decisions?
A. Absolutely.
Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell, one of the four individuals named in the ARB report, also told Oversight staff that Kennedy was the “ultimate decisionmaker” when it came to the removal of the SST team from Libya. This was the team of soldiers which Ambassador Stevens and others hoped to keep in Libya but which was removed weeks before the attack. Boswell also told Oversight staffers that “any decision about travel in and out, staffing levels was made by” Kennedy. This included both the assignment of diplomatic staff and security personnel.
Executive Director of the Near Eastern Affairs Bureau Lee Lohman told Oversight that he attended a meeting at which Kennedy personally examined schematics for the villa in Benghazi. Lohman said Kennedy was “heavily” involved in choosing the facility.
The report also points out that Kennedy was the single individual who, based on a staff recommendation, approved keeping the Benghazi post open as a temporary facility for an additional year. It was because the compound was temporary and not a permanent site that its security was staffed on a temporary basis by DS agents on leave from other positions. The temporary staffing system was intended to fill single openings or gaps in staffing on a short term basis, not provide and entire staff indefinitely. As a result, DS never had a full security compliment in place in Benghazi. 
The new report also criticizes Kennedy’s role in presenting a false image of accountability to the public. Under Secretary Kennedy informed Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell that he had been singled out in the ARB report. Boswell offered his resignation and Kennedy accepted it. However Kennedy simultaneously encouraged Boswell to hang on to another position he held. A few days later, Kennedy told Boswell he was being placed on administrative leave. However, quoting Boswell from the Oversight interview, Kennedy told Boswell “he didn’t think it would last long.”
The Oversight report strongly suggests that the ARB report should have assigned blame to Under Secretary Kennedy for his involvement in numerous decisions which created the lax security situation in Benghazi. 
Under Secretary Kennedy is scheduled to testify at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Rep. Issa has scheduled a separate hearing with Adm. Mike Mullen and Amb. Thomas Pickering, the authors of the contested ARB report, for Thursday."
217,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/09/25/1241315/-Sen-Tester-Kills-Monsanto-Protection-Rider,News,Dailykos,Republican,Sen Tester Kills Monsanto Protection Rider,"

Despite the efforts of House members like Rep Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) to kill the Monsanto Protection Rider, it passed in the House version of the short-term appropriations bill, the Continuing Resolution (CR).
Today the Senate was successful in stripping this provision out of the CR.
According to Sen Brian Schatz (D-HI)
""The Monsanto Protection Act is bad policy for the country and the State of Hawai‘i. The Senate version of the Continuing Resolution does not include this provision, effectively repealing the Monsanto Protection Act. This provision took the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture to fully exercise his regulatory power over GMOs, and compromised the role of our courts as a check on the legislative and executive systems, making it significantly more difficult for concerned citizens to present their case.
I strongly urge the House not to sneak the Monsanto Protection Act back into the final version of the appropriations bill. However, if it is slipped back in, rather than letting the issue be deliberated with full transparency and public input, I will immediately introduce legislation to repeal it.""

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), a farmer himself said:
Stripping the Monsanto Protection Act is a victory for American consumers and family farm agriculture.  Corporate giveaways have no business in a bill to fund the government, and I’m pleased that the Senate stood up for accountability and transparency and against special interests.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Schatz to make sure that this damaging provision never again makes it into law.""
Hawai'i has been called ""ground zero"" for GMO/Agricultural Chemicals development. Its mild climate allows two growing seasons and its small legislature is easily bought out. In fact only 10 members of the Hawai'i legislature are not recipients of GMO/Chem money.

The GMO seed companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, and Dupont are the biggest agricultural chemical manufacturers. Their controversial claims of GMO seeds cutting down on pesticides are exactly opposite of reality. According to Organic Consumers herbicides account for about one-third of the global pesticide market, and around 80% of GM seeds involve herbicide-resistance.
Agriculture chemicals have poisoned aquifers on Oahu and Maui.
Kaua'i now has a bill pending that would require companies like Syngenta to disclose what pesticides they are spraying. Kaua'i residents are concerned not only with existing EPA registered pesticides but the experiments with the unregistered pesticides these GMO companies are developing.
So it is no surprise that popular and progressive Sen Brian Schatz responded to his many constituent calls and helped kill the Monsanto Protection Rider.
However.
Sen Schatz is being primaried by a New Democrat Coalition corporatist, Colleen Hanabusa.  She has been conspicuously quiet on the subject of the Monsanto Rider.
No wonder. Her group, the New Dems, sees biotech as the ""future of the U.S.""  They successfully pushed to extend patents and give corporate welfare to biotech companies.
""New Democrats believe the federal government can promote advances in biotechnology by providing funding for basic research, ensuring the protection of intellectual property and investing in regulatory agencies such as the Patent and Trademark Office and the Federal Drug Administration. ""
Hanabusa is quoted in the latest New Dem press release urging Congress to put partisanship aside.  But according to the New Dems, that means embracing the odious Simpson-Bowles recommendations that balance the budget on the backs of the poor and elderly by cutting Social Security and other safety nets.
Not one word about the New Dems' support of corporate welfare and eternal war.
Sen. Schatz kept his constituents updated on the Monsanto Rider and his (successful) efforts to remove it as well as the nonsensical provision to defund the Affordable Care Act.  We heard about defunding the ACA many times from Hanabusa (always in conjunction with increasingly desperate pleas for donations) but not one word on the Monsanto Rider.

An article in the Taliban magazine Azan compares Barack Obama at this point with Michel Gorbachev in 1989–saying both lost in Afghanistan and both lost their own countries. 
The article opens by describing Afghanistan as “the graveyard of empires” which is “bearing witness to the fall of another self-proclaimed ‘Super Power,’ i.e. the U.S.A.”
The Middle East Media Research Institute has provided excerpts of the article in which various examples of Muslim military victories throughout the centuries are highlighted. The article then turns toward contemporary wars, making the point that just as the Soviets left Afghanistan in defeat so too: 

The world is seeing as a handful of mujahideen under the leadership of Mullah Omar are defeating one of the most powerful super powers in the history of the world. …When the U.S. attacked Afghanistan [in October 2001], the people of intellect were wondering how long it would take for America to suffer its inevitable defeat and who would be leading its army when it would eventually drag its defeated tail out of Afghanistan.
The excerpts also show a juxtaposition between the rise of poverty and want in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev in the 1980s and the rise of traditional poverty indicators under Obama during this time in office. Whereas Gorbachev had to introduce a “war-food system of food distribution for his citizens,” America has witnessed a poverty increase from 37.3 million in 2007 to 46.9 million in 2010, according to Azan. 
Moreover, the article touches on the “severe public discontent” under Gorbachev and the movements calling for “separation” which erupted in parts of the Soviet Union at that time. In the same way, the article claims there are “various movements” likewise calling for separation in the U.S. now. According to Azan, “around 30 states [are] calling for separation.”
Although the figure of “30 states” is wrong, the overarching goal of the article may still prove successful–that goal is to show that Obama, like Gorbachev before him, is a weak man who’s losing his grip on this own country while simultaneously facing defeat abroad. 
The tagline is simple–Obama is weak like Gorbachev, the U.S. is being defeated like the U.S.S.R."

Last night, Stephen Colbert exposed just what a fraud Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is when it comes to anything coherent on Syria.
For more, let's get the Republican response from Senator Rand Paul, who made the rounds on the cable news shows last night after first delivering the traditional State of the Rand speech.  Now, Paul has been opposed to military action from the beginning, so he was thrilled by Russia's diplomatic proposal.
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): I don't know whether to trust the proposal or not. ... The question is, are they serious? ... Can we trust the participants in this plan?
Right.  You can't always trust.  For instance, that thing on your head.  You assure us that it's hair, but I have yet to be convinced it's not a slumbering wombat ready to strike at any time.

So you know what?  I agree with Rand Paul.  We cannot trust Russia or Syria.  Killing civilians is bad, but it's not that bad.  We shouldn't do anything.
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): It's a violation of every norm for someone to kill civilians, and I think Assad should be accountable.
Absolutely.  Got to hold him accountable.  Otherwise, what are we as a nation, Not-Accountable-Stan?

So I agree with Rand Paul.  No, Jimmy, the second Rand Paul.

Thank you.  OK.  We must hold them accountable with the President's plan of limited strikes.  Send a message.
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): They have said that the war would be ""unbelievably small"" and limited.  To me that sounds like they are pre-announcing that the military strikes will not punish Assad personally or effect regime change. ... I think if Assad's responsible, he deserves death for this.
Death it is, regime change, shock and awe, bombs away!
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): I think if we bomb Assad, I think it will more likely that the country becomes more unstable. ... Just about any bad outcome you could imagine is made more likely by U.S. involvement in the Syrian civil war.
OK, I was wrong, this is the Rand Paul I agree with.  Cuz think about it, if we take out the guy who gasses children, somebody bad might take over.  So just to recap, Rand Paul says:
1) no diplomacy,
2) can't do nothing,
3) but no to the President's plan,
4) and no to regime change.
I mean, taken all together, that's really....................................... huh.

You know what, I'm not sure how I would describe Rand Paul's response to the President.  Um, you know what, Rand Paul, how would you describe Rand Paul?
SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY (9/10/2013): I think he's been a little bit here, a little bit there, and a little bit everywhere. ... I don't think he makes any sense.
You know what?  You could not have said it better yourself.  (audience cheering and applause)  We'll be right back.

220,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2013/05/29/Blame-the-President-for-Benghazi,News,Breitbart,Republican,Blame the President for Benghazi,"

When the American mission in Benghazi, Libya was attacked on September 11th, 2012, only one person had the positional authority, legal mandate, and communications apparatus to give the order to defend our personnel on the ground: the President of the United States.
The President did not give that order, and four Americans died in Benghazi that day. All the rest of the nonsense to which we have been treated-from prepared talking points, congressional hearings, and finally to the outright lies-matter not when compared to the ignominious moments in which the President of the United States refused to do his job.
That same day, two other American embassies in the Middle East were also under attack in Sana, Yemen and Cairo, Egypt. As a result, our intelligence systems were on high alert. When the calls, satellite and drone feeds, faxes, and reports began bombarding every command center from Germany to the United States, our nation, already at war for eleven years, was again under siege. Staffs from Africa Command, European Command, the National Military Command Center, the CIA Operations Center, the State Department Operations Center, and the White House Situation Room were fully operational.
This all means that on September 11, 2012, our national security apparatus was on full alert. It means everyone was briefed. This is how it works; no games, no conjecture, no television and movie looks, just real battle in real time with real lives at risk.
The road to that indecision is littered with policy and leadership failures that culminated in an American mission and clandestine CIA base being attacked and the murder of our Ambassador and three dedicated Americans doing their jobs. However, the one person responsible for it all is the one man who could have, but refused to, even try to stop the carnage… the President of the United States.
All the President had to say within the first two hours while being briefed by the Secretary of Defense was, “Send in a response force.” This command, followed by his signature on a paper called Cross Border Authority, would have ordered the Department of Defense to do everything and anything to save lives in Benghazi, Libya. 
Three and a half years earlier, on April 9, 2009, President Obama had done exactly that when pirates hijacked an American flagged merchant ship, Maersk Alabama, sailing off the coast of Somalia. In this earlier incident, the President made the right decision within hours to allow SEAL Team Six the time to plan and go. In the end, we all witnessed a textbook successful rescue operation. 
Fast forward to September 11, 2012, and we have a desperate situation with Americans in jeopardy. The same President, instead of deciding how to respond, disappeared for the evening  and then went to Las Vegas the following day to raise money for his re-election campaign.
Had the President ordered a rescue, he had everything he needed to mount a prompt and forceful response–from F-16’s in Aviano, Italy, to an armed and fueled plane standing by at C Company, 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group, training in Croatia-a mere three hours from Benghazi by air. 
When the first shot was fired in Benghazi, no one knew how long the fight would last. Subsequent government claims saying we could not get there within the seven-plus hours that the tragedy lasted are specious at best and an outright lie at worst. We did not even care enough to try; that fact alone should make all Americans who mourn the loss of four of our countrymen very angry.
This ultimate Presidential control–the ability to bring armed American forces to bear anywhere in the world within hours–has existed for over 25 years. It exists precisely because of past mistakes and embarrassing moments brought to us by various governmental agencies, congresses, and presidents.
Since September 11th, 2012, we have been treated to a tractor-trailer load of misdirection, disingenuous speeches, television appearances, and outright lying by public officials at every level of the government of the United States of America. Now with other scandals hitting the news, we are beginning to forget and confuse what is the only important point to know after we acknowledge and pray for the four Americans murdered by terrorists that fateful day.
There is one simple point to be made about Benghazi: the President of the United States is the only human being on the planet that can order a bullet, a missile, a plane, a drone, a boat, a helicopter, a soldier, sailor, spy, or push cart with a squirt gun attached to go into another country and perform an aggressive action.
On September 11, 2012, we know the President failed to give that order. We don’t know where he was, what he was doing, or why he failed to act. But we do know he failed to act, and that inaction cost the lives of four brave Americans."

A group of special operations veterans is demanding House Speaker John Boehner form a Select Committee to uncover the truth behind the Benghazi attacks. The group said that Americans and the world will not be able to trust the Obama administration on Syria until it tells the truth about what happened in Benghazi. 
Larry Ward, the political director of Special Operations Speaks (SOS), told Breitbart News that Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) was “dead on when he linked action in Syria to the Benghazi Massacre and cover up” when he questioned Secretary of State John Kerry before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday. 
“How is anyone supposed to believe anything that comes out of this Administration?” Ward said to Breitbart News. He noted that Americans and world leaders do not trust the Obama administration on foreign policy matters after Obama, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and then-Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice lied over and over about “the YouTube video.” The video depicting Muhammed was initially said to be responsible for the attacks. 
Duncan, holding up a photo of former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who died in the attacks, told Kerry that Benghazi was vitally germane to the Syria debate. 
“Before we commit the lives of American sons and daughters into a civil war half way around the globe, we must be told the whole truth about the Benghazi Massacre,” Ward said. 
To uncover that truth, SOS sent an open letter to House Majority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) this week, saying it was “deeply troubling” that Boehner has refused to create a Select Committee on Benghazi. The group urged him to answer the unanswered questions about the Benghazi massacre within a week, form a Select Committee to find the truth, or resign his speakership. 
In the letter, the group claimed Boehner would be complicit in the Obama administration’s Benghazi cover-up if he failed to act. "

The Obama administration has been forced to admit that the nuclear deal to which Iran agreed last weekend in Geneva, Switzlerland has not actually been finalized. In the interim, Iran is continuing its enrichment of uranium, as well as continuing construction on the Arak nuclear plant it is meant to suspend. And the White House is being criticized for misleading the public about the terms of the Iran deal, which keep getting worse.
The Washington Post noted, in an editorial otherwise supportive of the deal, that the Obama administration had not told the whole truth: “What the White House didn’t report is that the text of the accord makes several major concessions to Tehran on the terms of a planned second-stage agreement…the United States and its partners have already agreed that Iranian enrichment activity will continue indefinitely. In contrast, a long-standing U.S. demand that an underground enrichment facility be closed is not mentioned.”
Iran clearly expects that the deal will eventually lead to the end of all sanctions against the regime for its repeated violations of UN Security Council resolutions that ban any nuclear enrichment, and that it will see its so-called “right” to enrich uranium recognized either explicitly or de facto, without restrictions–and not in 15-20 years, as the administration has implied, but in a mere five years from the signing of the deal.
No one is quite sure when the deal begins, and when the six-month window contemplated under the terms will be over. So Iran continues to play for time, and the Obama administration, having accepted Iran’s nuclear enrichment in principle, is forced to accept interpretations of the deal that favor Iran, having lost the leverage sanctions once provided. As the line from The Empire Strikes Back goes: this deal’s getting worse all the time.

Chuck Hagel, filibustered Republican nominee.



Chuck Hagel, filibustered Republican nominee.

The Senate is going to take a second stab at a confirmation vote for former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to be defense secretary next Tuesday, and indications are that this time Republicans won't have the votes to sustain their filibuster. Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) will vote for Hagel on Tuesday. Damning him with faint praise, Shelby told the Decatur Daily that Hagel is ""probably as good as we're going to get,"" in announcing his vote switch.
What else could Republicans really do at this point, particularly after the national humiliation of the ""Friends of Hamas"" debacle? There is a diehard corps of Republicans, though, that don't seem to get that they've made themselves public laughingstocks, and who just aren't capable of being embarrassed into backing down. That would be the 15 who wrote a letter to President Obama demanding that he withdraw the nomination. They include Lindsey ""I'm a tea partier! Really!"" Graham, Jim ""Hamas is like the Salvation Army"" Inhofe, and Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz who, and this is true, has a list of the communists who have infiltrated Harvard Law School. Oh, and 2016's would-be golden boy, Marco Rubio.
But with Shelby moving on, the gig is up. Republicans Thad Cochran, Mike Johanns, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski voted with Democrats last week to end cloture, and very likely will again. With all 55 Democrats, that's all she wrote. Even John McCain appears to know that enough is enough, and is ready to give up and vote for cloture. If there are already enough Republican votes to get it done, though, McCain will probably just be pissy enough to vote no. Because that's just who he is.
The pointless delay of Hagel's confirmation has accomplished a few things about Republicans, however. First, no matter how outlandish the story, if Breitbart reports it, they'll run with it. Second, these are the people who have de facto control over the Senate! They'll filibuster anything on the flimsiest of grounds, just because the can, new filibuster rules be damned.
That still has to change. If you haven't already, please sign our petition urging Harry Reid to re-open the process of filibuster reform in the Senate.

President Obama: The American people elected their representatives to make their lives easier, not harder
This is what it comes down to.
The GOP hopes that if they can make enough Americans suffer it will hurt President Obama.
The GOP has an agenda that hurts 99% of Americans and only benefits the wealthiest 1%. They ran on that agenda in 2012 with Romney/Ryan and lost badly. The American people have rejected the GOP's ""1%ers Only"" agenda and will continue to do so no matter what screeching Teabaggers believe.
The majority of Americans who aren't brainwashed Fox viewers overwhelmingly want Representatives in Congress that will make our lives better, not harder.
The choice is clear, if you want a sane and functioning Government that tries to make life better for the average American you should vote for Democrats.

This Republican Government Shutdown isn't just about killing Obamacare, it is about overturning the results of the 2012 Presidential Election.

225,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/05/27/The-Ailes-Manifesto,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,The Ailes Manifesto: America Rallies Around Roger Ailes and Fox News,"
Fox News CEO Roger Ailes’ May 23 stirring letter to Fox employees will be remembered as a turning point in the battle for freedom of the press in the age of Obama.  
The Ailes letter, denouncing the Obama administration’s trampling on the First Amendment, should be seen, of course, as a strong defense of Fox correspondent James Rosen. In addition, the Ailes letter–in truth, a manifesto–is a staunch vindication of Fox News and its “speak-truth-to-power” approach to journalism. Finally, the Ailes Manifesto should be seen as a clarion call for freedom–for freedom of the press, and also for the right of all Americans to think freely, liberated from the MSM thought-monopoly.  
As Patrick Caddell has pointed out here at Breitbart News, the Obama Administration has never truly been worried about leaks, because the Administration itself has been the main source of leaks. Why? For political advantage, of course. That is, to make the Administration look good, especially in regard to the war on terror in the run-up to the 2012 election. 
The Obamans wanted to maintain their exclusive “franchise” on leaks, rewarding friendly reporters, such as The New York Times’ David Sanger, with information on highly-classified programs, including the Stuxnet virus used against Iran. In fact, Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, upon reading Sanger’s book Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power, said, “You learn more from the book than I did as Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and that’s very disturbing to me.” In other words, US national security was a distant second, well behind the primary goal, which was the President’s re-election.  
To be sure, the Obama Administration leaked for other reasons, as well. As Breitbart News’ Matthew Boyle reported, the Obama Justice Department was happy to leak documents to advance its own interests in the “Fast and Furious” scandal.  
It is obvious that the Obama Administration will leak any information regardless of its sensitivity to national security or to individuals’ reputations when it is expedient for political gain. The facts are incontrovertible, over a broad range of issues, over a long period of time.  
While the Obama administration has been playing this dangerous game, Roger Ailes has been clear and straightforward. The Ailes Manifesto is, indeed, fierce in its defense of freedom. As the Fox News founder–at the helm, now, for 17 years–wrote: 
The administration’s attempt to intimidate Fox News and its employees will not succeed and their excuses will stand neither the test of law, the test of decency, nor the test of time. We will not allow a climate of press intimidation, unseen since the McCarthy era, to frighten any of us away from the truth.
Even amidst the greatest threat to press freedom in six decades, neither Fox, nor its friends and allies, are going to back away, or back down. The fight for freedom is a fight for all of us.  
Indeed, as the Ailes Manifesto continues to reverberate through the media and political landscape, we can observe three kinds of reaction: first, strong awareness and support from the activist public; second, a surprising amount of solidarity from the other journalists and journalistic organizations; and third, a cringing U-turn by some notorious Obama administration lackeys and lapdogs.  
So let’s look at each of these three categories in turn. 
First, support from the activist public. Social media showed a huge outpouring of support for reporter Rosen and the Ailes letter. “Ailes’ letter give you a sense of him as a boss,” one Twitter user said. “Kind of man that inspires real loyalty out of respect.”
“Simply put, Roger Ailes, a true principled Leader,” said another. One response read, “The Roger Ailes memo might be the most badass thing I’ve ever read.”
Another reader remarked, “Roger Ailes sounds downright Churchillian.”
Second, others in the MSM have chosen to side with Fox, at least on this one issue. Urged on by press leaders–including Fox News’ Ed Henry, who said to fellow pressies, “let’s not be a bunch of lemmings”–many MSM-ers have chosen to do the right thing, even if it pains them. As Joel Pollak noted, stalwart liberal Alex Seitz-Wald of Salon.com was moved to tweet, “I understand lib cognitive dissonance on Obama admin going after Fox reporter, but only right answer is #TeamRosen.”
Fox News Opinion summed up much of this diverse media support in a May 23 compendium titled, “They All Stand with Fox News’ James Rosen.” The piece took note of supportive comments from staffers of CNN, The New Yorker, The Washington Post–even former anchor Keith Olbermann. Remarkably, the tabloid-y TMZ, not known for its political coverage, had to agree that the controversy, and the Ailes Manifesto, constituted a hot story. 
On May 21, the White House Correspondents Association issued a strong statement: 
Reporters should never be threatened with prosecution for the simple act of doing their jobs. The problem is that in two recent cases, one involving Fox News’ James Rosen and the other focused on the Associated Press, serious questions have been raised about whether our government has gotten far too aggressive in its monitoring of reporters’ movements, phone records, and even personal email.
Meanwhile, the support keeps coming. On Saturday, The Washington Post wrote a tough pro-Rosen editorial titled, “The freedom to ask,” in which the Post quoted the Justice Department’s own stated policy on leak investigations, which declares, “The prosecutorial power of the government should not be used in such a way that it impairs a reporter’s responsibility to cover as broadly as possible controversial public issues.” The Post then added, “The Obama administration should recommit to its spirit.” 
Third, even some of Obama’s most groveling fans have had to adjust course in light of the new knowledge about his administration’s bullying methods. In fact, support for Ailes and Fox has been so broad and strong that even mortal enemies of Fox have had to come around, however grudgingly. For example, Media Matters for America (MMFA), the George Soros-funded anti-Fox smear operation run by David Brock, has been forced to do a 180 from its original pro-Obama position.  
On May 14, as the news about the Justice Department investigations was breaking, MMFA slavishly published talking points in support for the Obama administration. In other words, the MMFA Obama-propaganda operation was trying to teach others how they, too, could be Obama-propagandists. Yet after a firestorm of criticism, MMFA shifted its position, albeit over ten long days. 
On May 24, MMFA Senior Fellow and Andrew Breitbart bête noire Eric Boehlert, reflecting this new line, complained that “federal law enforcement seems preoccupied with snooping around, in increasingly clandestine ways, and ensnaring reporters in criminal investigations.” Well, yes; better late than never.  
Boehlert continued in this manner, even allowing for the heretical thought that Fox News might not be at fault in everything: 
Whether it was the Department of Justice’s wild overreach in seizing phone records of more than 20 separate telephone lines used by Associated Press editors and reporters, or the Department’s more focused, yet even more troubling, information grab of a Fox News reporter, the practice is wrong and shortsighted. It’s also un-American.
One can only imagine the drama inside MMFA before those anti-Obama Administration words were printed on its site. Which was more gut-wrenching for David Brock, criticizing the Obama Administration or defending Fox News from it?
Of course, as Pollak wrote, the pro-Ailes/pro-Fox sentiment, while welcome, is unlikely to last for long:   
Now that Holder has been caught in a hacking scandal of his own–first of telephones at the Associated Press, then of Rosen and other Fox News journalists–the playing field is leveled. And even though the wider media solidarity with Fox News is doomed to be short-lived, from now on the White House will face bolder, fearless conservative media, confident in the knowledge that they are defending universal principles.
Still, Ailes and Fox have made their point, and it will be an enduring point. The impact of the strong Ailes Manifesto and the unyielding Fox stance may be felt only briefly among the MSM, but it will remembered forever in conservative, libertarian, and constitutionalist circles.   
On this Memorial Day, these words of Ailes have it exactly right: 
Too many Americans fought and died to protect our unique American right of press freedom. We can’t and we won’t forget that. To be an American journalist is not only a great responsibility, but also a great honor. To be a Fox journalist is a high honor, not a high crime.
And we here at Breitbart News might humbly add: it’s a high honor to be an American on the same side as Roger Ailes, James Rosen, and Fox News, in this historic fight for freedom. Together, we will win, because victory begets victory. "

If you think the most recent ""embrace the suck"" passed in the House that screws military veterans' pension benefits is just one step in the effort to screw vets, you'd be wrong. In fact, these ideas and worse have been brewing in Washington for a few years now. I first covered this issue in 2011, when the Obama Administration first began proposing 85 percent cuts in military pension plans. I noted later that year that a big battle was brewing over it, and then again in 2012 when some of the proposed cuts became part of Grand Bargain negotiations. Each time, military families have fought back, including our very own angelajean, MilitaryTracy, and others who are part of the Daily Kos Military Group. First and foremost, join their campaign to fight this cut in military benefits.
Make no mistake, the Administration and Congress have big plans for military veterans and their retirement and none of them are good.
Among the changes being considered:
The Department should establish a new structure for the military retirement system, based on annual contributions. One model for this new structure is the existing Uniformed Military Personnel Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).
The TSP operates in much the same way as a 401(k) plan, which is the largest scam ever perpetrated in the history of finance. Money is taken out of your meager military pay and then invested in mutual-type funds. They work just like a 401(k) plan, in that you can take the money out before you retire, borrow against it, or play around in high-risk securities with it. One of the funds invests in government securities and is managed by the Plan's trustees. Those funds will not ever lose money, so long as there is never a default. But, you guessed right, the rest of the funds are invested in Wall Street securities. Those funds are managed by Larry Fink's BlackRock, a spin-off of Steven Schwartzman's Blackstone Group. Management fees are, of course, paid to BlackRock. How nice is that?
Please read below the fold for more on military benefits.


So, first things first: End pensions for military members, and instead, throw them into 401(k)-type plans managed by Wall Street firms. Which, I'm sure you all know, are just overflowing with happy retirees.
Next, this little turd:
DoD contributions could vary depending on the needs of the services, such as larger contributions at certain retention gates, specific Military Occupational Specialty, or other demands to assist in force shaping.  
Under the current deal, it does not matter what your rank or billet is. If you serve your 20 years, you get your pension for life. You put your life on the line, you get this promise in return for you and your family. It's that simple. But under the new plan, how much the Pentagon contributes to your market-sensitive 401(k) plan will depend on your rank and billet! How much would you guess that top brass will be deemed ""essential to force shaping"" and enlisted grunts get the shaft? That would be a sure bet because it's in the recommendations.
Now, one of the things the government needs to address is this problem: If you serve less than 20 years, you don't get a military pension. Yes, that is the deal, you know that going in. If you want to go to the private sector after a 4-year stint, well ... good on you. But what of someone who serves 15 or 19 years? Well, those folks should be taken care of, obviously. A graduated pension system makes sense. Your pension amount should start quite low and increase over time served, obviously. That is the obvious, sensible solution. Turn the retirement cliff into a slope.
The Administration and Congress, however, aren't proposing that as a simple solution. They propose to do away with military pensions altogether and put in a 401(k) system instead. I can't think of a greater insult to those whose jobs involve so much sacrifice for them and their families. Sometimes their very limbs. The current budget agreement passed in the House is just a first step, cutting the cost of living adjustment. The next step is junking the military pension system altogether.
There is no way President Obama and members of Congress can support this and claim with a straight face that they are keeping America's promise to our veterans.

227,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/15/Obama-Constitution-flashback,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,FLASHBACK: Obama: 'I Actually Respect The Constitution',"
In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) attended a fundraiser where he blasted President Bush, telling the crowd, “I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution.” President Obama, however, has been far less respectful of the Constitution that Senator Obama purportedly was. In fact, Obama has steadily violated a bevy of Constitutional provisions ranging from separation of powers to specific elements of the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.
This week, Obama unilaterally decided to tell insurance companies that they could now allow sale of plans in the individual insurance market that Obamacare had prevented, forcing five million Americans off the health plans they liked. As Ken Klukowski of Breitbart News has written, this is a violation of the Constitutional separation of powers: 
Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act.
But President Obama has a history of violating the Constitutional balance of powers. As Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has noted, he has unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration law; he has refused to prosecute drug law violators; he simply stopped defending federal laws he didn’t like, like the Defense of Marriage Act, in court; he issues waivers on Obamacare and the No Child Left Behind Act; Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has attempted to regulate carbon emissions when Congress didn’t push through a global warming bill; he appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board in violation of law; his administration rammed through an auto bailout that screwed bondholders, as well as a slush fund from British Petroleum. Strassel writes, “Mr. Obama came to office promising to deliver a new kind of politics. He did–his own, unilateral governance.”
President Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not extend to freedom of religion – his administration has forced religious businessowners to pay for insurance plans that cover activities in violation of religious precepts. It does not extend to freedom of speech – Obama has condemned exercises of speech he doesn’t like as violative of American principles (see, for example, the infamous YouTube video Obama said caused violence in the Middle East). It does not extend to equal protection under the laws – Obama has personally intervened in criminal cases like that of George Zimmerman. 
Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not apply to protections against unreasonable search and seizure, as Obama’s deeply intrusive National Security Agency programs prove. It does not apply to Fifth Amendment protections against taking of private property. It does not apply to the Second Amendment, as Obama’s executive orders on guns show. And it most certainly does not extend to the Tenth Amendment, which protects states’ rights. 
Obama has never respected the Constitution. In fact, he sees it as a barrier to his ambitions. That’s why, as a senior law lecturer at the University of Chicago, he lamented the fact that the Warren Court “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.” That’s why Obama repeatedly emphasizes that the Constitution stops him from doing things he wants to do — it’s an obstacle to be overcome, not the greatest governmental structure ever created.

No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.
--U.S. Constitution, Article I, sec. 9, cl. 3

Let's be clear: Marvin Peugh is a bad man, and no one questions that he engaged in a pair of financial schemes in 1999-2000 which led to his conviction on several counts of bank fraud and sentencing in March 2010. That much is not in dispute.
This is: The federal sentencing guidelines which were in effect at the time he committed the crime would have yielded a recommended sentence of 30-37 months; after their amendment in 2009, the recommended sentence for the same acts was 70-87 months. Peugh's lawyers insisted the Ex Post Facto clause should yield a sentence under the old guidelines; instead, the Hon. Frederick J. Kapala of the Northern District of Illinois sentenced him to 70 months, plus three years' supervised release joint and several liability for restitution (with his partner, also convicted) in the amount of $1,967,055.30. He appealed, lost before the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and appealed again to the Supremes.
And, so, after entertaining oral argument, a 5-4 decision of the Court written by Justice Sotomayor has reversed Peugh's sentence on account of the Ex Post Facto clause, and remanded for his resentencing, potentially saving him 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 years of jail time. Justice Kennedy supplied the fifth vote, Justice Thomas supplies yet another I'm More Originalist Than You marker, and I'll supply a healthy amount of explanation below the orange gnocchi.


First, this reminder: The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are, at this point in the law, only guidelines. Post-Apprendi and Booker, a federal district court judge must use the guidelines as a starting point, but is free to depart from them (in either direction) based on stated reasons so long as it is deemed a reasonable use of the judge's discretion.
Justice Sotomayor's decision starts with Calder v Bull, a 1798 decision of the Court, which held that the Ex Post Facto clause applies to:
“1st. Every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action. 2d. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed. 3d. Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence,  and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law  required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.”
And so, Justice Sotomayor argues, the guidelines are binding enough so as to effectively change the sentencing rules midstream:
That a district court may ultimately sentence a given defendant outside the Guidelines range does not deprive the Guidelines of force as the framework for sentencing. Indeed, the rule that an incorrect Guidelines calculation is procedural error ensures that they remain the starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system....
Peugh points to considerable empirical evidence indicating that the Sentencing Guidelines have the intended effect of influencing the sentences imposed by judges.  Even after Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases imposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences that depart downward from the Guidelines on the Government’s motion. In less than one-fifth of cases since 2007 have district courts imposed above- or below-Guidelines sentences absent a Government motion. Moreover, the Sentencing Commission’s data indicate that when a Guidelines range moves up or down, offenders’ sentences move with it.
The federal system adopts procedural measures intended to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing. A retrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable  to a defendant creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation.

To which the dissenters (led by Justice Thomas) argue, no, wait, a guideline is not a ""law"":
First, the Guidelines do not constrain the discretion of district courts and, thus, have no legal effect on a defendant’s sentence. Second, to the extent that the amended Guidelines create a risk that a defendant might receive a harsher punishment, that risk results from the Guidelines’ persuasive force, not any legal effect. The Guidelines help district judges to impose sentences that comply with §3553(a). The risk of an increased sentence is, in essence, the risk of a more accurate sentence—i.e., a sentence more in line with the statutory scheme’s penological goals. Guideline changes that help district courts achieve such pre-existing statutory sentencing goals do not create a risk of an increased sentence cognizable under the Ex Post Facto Clause.
To which Justice Sotomayor and the majority responds:
The Government does not challenge these holdings but rather argues, in essence, that the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences to give rise to an ex post facto violation....
On the Government’s account, the Guidelines are just one among many persuasive sources a sentencing court can consult, no different from a “policy paper.” The Government’s argument fails to acknowledge, however, that district courts are not required to consult any policy paper in order to avoid reversible procedural error; nor must they “consider the extent of [their] deviation” from a given policy paper and “ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance."" Courts of appeals, in turn, are not permitted to presume that a sentence that comports with a particular policy paper is reasonable; nor do courts of appeals, in considering whether the district court’s sentence was reasonable, weigh the extent of any departure from a given policy paper in determining whether the district court abused its discretion. It is simply not the case that the Sentencing Guidelines are merely a volume that the district court reads with academic interest in the course of sentencing….
District courts must begin their sentencing analysis with the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense and use them to calculate the sentencing range correctly; and those Guidelines will anchor both the district court’s discretion and the appellate review process in all of the ways we have described. The newer Guidelines, meanwhile, will have the status of one of many reasons a district court might give for deviating from the older Guidelines, a status that is simply not equivalent for ex post facto purposes.

The arguments put forward by the Government and the dissent cannot unseat the conclusion that Peugh’s case falls within Calder’s third category of ex post facto violations. “[T]he Ex Post Facto Clause forbids the [government] to enhance the measure of punishment by altering the substantive ‘formula’ used to calculate the applicable sentencing range.” Morales, 514 U. S., at 505. That is precisely what the amended Guidelines did here.
Oh, snap. Justice Thomas wrote the Morales decision.
So that's that. Almost. Because I need to flag one more instance, where, yet again, Justice Thomas flies solo, going much further into originalist precedent-destroying than any of his conservative colleagues. See, Justice Thomas would have also held that ""nothing in the text or history of the Ex Post Facto Clause suggests that it should hinge on the expectations that prisoners and defendants have about how many days they will spend in prison,"" and hold that so long as the longer sentence was possible under the earlier sentencing regime, it would not violate the Ex Post Facto clause to impose it on the defendant. Everyone who's been interpreting Calder in the subsequent 200+ years, Justice Thomas believes, has been doing it wrong (even though he, himself, did the same thing in Morales in 1995):
Retroactive laws that merely create a risk that a defendant will receive a higher sentence, however, do not implicate traditional ex post facto concerns. An individual contemplating the commission of a given offense knows he may be sentenced anywhere within the legally prescribed range. He may hope to receive a lenient sentence, and he may even have good reasons for expecting leniency. But he does not have any guarantees. See Garner, 529 U. S., at 258 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part in judgment) (“Discretion to be compassionate or harsh is inherent in the sentencing scheme, and being denied compassion is one of the risks that the offender knowingly assumes”). The law provides the defendant with only one assurance: He will be sentenced within the range affixed to his offense by statute. Legal changes that alter the likelihood of a particular sentence within the legally prescribed range do not deprive people of notice and fair warning, or implicate the concerns about tyranny that animated the adoption of the Ex Post Facto Clause.
As to his undermining his own decision in Morales, Justice Thomas sheepishly drops a footnote:
As the author of Morales, failure to apply the original meaning was an error to which I succumbed.
Again: Only Thomas went there. (He also clearly loses points for the wussy use of the passive voice. How about ""As the author of Morales, I erred in failing to apply original meaning""?)
Indeed, Justices Alito and Scalia issued a separate dissent just to make clear to everyone that they wouldn't (yet). In its entirety, it reads:
I agree with JUSTICE THOMAS that retroactive application of amended advisory Guidelines does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause under our “sufficient risk” test. See California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499, 509 (1995). I do not have occasion in this case to reconsider  that test’s merits or its relation to the original understanding of the Clause.
So Peugh goes to jail (for less time, probably), and Justice Thomas goes his own way. Again.

Let's say, just hypothetically, you are the attorney general for the commonwealth of Virginia. So it's sort of your job to uphold and enforce the law, even the laws you don't like, because that's part of the job. You know what isn't part of the job? Advising people to break the law you've sworn to uphold.
While that might seem obvious, apparently it isn't so obvious to a certain attorney general and wannabe governor whose name is Ken Cuccinelli. (As is so often necessary when discussing Republicans, please note this is not from The Onion.)
Cuccinelli recounted an exchange with his own bishop in which he counseled the cleric to embrace civil disobedience: “My local bishop said, ‘Well, you know I told a group I’m ready to go to jail.’ And I said, ‘Bishop, don’t take this personally: You need to go to jail.’”
Lest you think Cuccinelli and his bishop were casually discussing breaking the law in a righteous battle for some greater good, you can stop that right now. Because the greater good for which these two fine Catholics think law-breaking is worthwhile is, of course, the fight to stop women from having access to basic health care because Abraham Lincoln had some good quotes about stuff and also religious liberty:
“You know, Abraham Lincoln has many good quotes, but one of them is ‘the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it vigorously.’ And here we’re going to have an example of what tyranny means when it’s played to its logical conclusion,” Cuccinelli said. “Because forcing business owners and businesses to do this is not consistent with our history of preserving religious liberty, one of the most important protections we have in this country.”
If you're scratching your head trying to figure out how encouraging civil disobedience is actually a form of ""vigorously"" enforcing the law, don't bother. It doesn't make sense, and it isn't supposed to. We're talking about Republicans, after all, and they never let a little thing, like not making a goddamned bit of sense, stop them.
For almost a year, wingnuts and Catholic bishops (and yes, in the Venn diagram, that's basically just one big circle) have been whining and stamping their feet and reciting their favorite old timey quotes because it makes them super sad to think about women having basic health care. This has not actually persuaded anyone that women having health care is a bad thing. Quite the opposite, as demonstrated by about a bazillion polls on the issue. Not like that ever stops them.
So Cuccinelli, in his run for governor, is definitely doing his best to appeal to the wingnuttiest wingnuts in his base, and damnit, he'll even advise breaking the law—contrary to, you know, his current job description—to prove that he's just the guy for them.

Last night, Bill Maher explained the real reason conservatives should be so afraid of California — because we're a living experiment that shows everything they've been preaching is pure unadulterated bullshit.
And finally, New Rule: Conservatives who love to brag about American exceptionalism must come here to California, and see it in person.  And then they should be afraid.  Because while right-wingers are taking over places like North Carolina and Texas and even Wisconsin, California is creating the kind of modern, liberal nation the country as a whole can only dream about.  And not only can't the rest of the country stop us — we're going to drag you with us.  (audience cheering and applause)
Now, it wasn't that long ago that pundits were calling California a failed state and saying it was ungovernable.  But in 2010, when other states were busy electing whatever Tea Partier claimed to hate government the most, we elected a guy who actually liked it — Jerry Brown.  And without a Republican governor and without a legislature cock-blocked by Republicans, (audience laughter) a $27 billion deficit was turned into a surplus.
How?  Well it's amazing, really.  We did something economists call cutting spending and raising taxes.  (audience applause)  I know, it sounds like crazy science fiction, but you see, here in California, we're not just gluten-free and soy-free and peanut-free, we're Tea Party free!  (massive audience cheering and applause)
Yes, we can live in reality!  I mean, Texas could do it too, but they love ""freedom"" too much.  Like when that unregulated fertilizer plant blew up.  In California, when things blow up, it's because we're making a Jason Statham movie.  No, California is not perfect, but it is in our nature to try new things.  For example, now that it's clear Obamacare is going to be a success here, the movement to just go all the way to single payer is gathering steam.  (audience applause)
In lots of areas, California has decided not to wait around for the caboose part of America to get on board.  Yokels can mock ""European style democracies"" all they want.  We're building one here — gay marriage, pot smoking, regulating carbon.  And people like it.  The same way when Americans come back from a vacation in Europe, they all say the same thing: ""I saw titties on the beach!""  (audience laughter)  But they also remark on the modern airports and train stations over there, and the absence of beggars in the street, and food that tastes like food.  (audience applause)  And they wonder, ""Why can't we get that here?""
Well, you will be getting that here, courtesy of the Golden State.  Why?  Because we're huge.  We're huge!  40 million of us!  (audience cheering)  When we demand something, the market must supply it.  Like when California set a high mileage standard for cars sold in this state, Detroit had to make more efficient cars.  California by itself is the 8th largest economy in the world, the fifth largest agricultural exporter, and of course, #1 in laser vaginal rejuvenation.  (audience laughter)  Oh, I pat myself on the back.
You know, it's so ironic, the two things conservatives love the most — the free market and states rights — are the two things that are going to bend this country into California's image as a socialist fagtopia.  (audience cheering and applause)  Maybe our constipated Congress in Washington can't pass gun control laws, but we just did.  Because we don't give a shit about the NRA.  Out here, that stands for ""Nuts, Racists, and Assholes.""  (massive audience cheering and applause)
And while other state governments are working with Jesus to make abortion more miserable — because otherwise women would just use it for weight loss (audience oohs) — California is making it easier.  And while immigrants are demonized in Washington and elsewhere, in California we just OK'd driver's licenses for undocumented aliens.  (audience applause)  That's right, we're letting them drive cars — just like white people!  Because we can't be worrying about all the nonsense that keeps Fox News viewers up at night, when they should be in bed adjusting their sleep apnea mask.  (audience laughter)
So in conclusion, my message to the rest of America is just this: DO NOT RESIST!!  Kneel before Zod!  California has been setting the trend in America for decades, and it's not going to stop now.  We say jump, you say, ""Please, sell me new exercise clothes for jumping.""  (audience applause)  We said put cilantro in food, and dammit, you did, you put cilantro in food, even though neither one of us knows what it is.  And almond milk?  Come on!  We just had some extra almonds and thought we'd fuck with you.  (audience laughter)

Video below the fold.




Bill Maher also wrote up a fuller version of this New Rule over at Huffington Post.  One part that was cut out for time that was a good explanation of what happened was this.
Since then, everything Republicans say can't or won't work — gun control, immigration reform, high-speed rail — California is making work.  And everything conservatives claim will unravel the fabric of our society — universal healthcare, higher taxes on the rich, gay marriage, medical marijuana — has only made California stronger.  And all we had to do to accomplish that was vote out every single Republican.

North Carolina's Racial Justice Act was model legislation that enabled death sentences which were tainted by racial discrimination to be reduced to sentences of life in prison without parole. McCrory, who posed as a moderate businessman when he ran for election, took off his business suit and put on his white robes when he signed this vile legislation on June 19. Not content with merely riling up his most racist supporters, McCrory is attacking the United States Constitution by attempting to make the legislation retroactive.

NC NAACP Responds to the Disturbing Repeal of the Racial Justice Act
On Juneteenth Holiday
June 19, 1865–or Juneteenth–is celebrated around the world as the day of liberation for millions of enslaved African Americans in the southern states.  Although all enslaved people in the southern states that were still engaged in an open rebellion against the United States had been declared free in January 1, 1863, in most of the states there were not enough U.S. military forces to enforce the end of slavery.  When the U.S. Navy fleet sailed into the Galveston Harbor in Texas, however, with sufficient U.S. military forces to back up his words of freedom, U.S. General Gordon Granger read U.S. Army General Order #3: ”The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.”
“Gov. Patrick McCrory picked Juneteenth–of all the days in the year, –to reinstate North Carolina’s proven race-based system of death, to sign an unconstitutional and flawed law that repeals North Carolina’s nationally-acclaimed Racial Justice Act, ” said Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, President of the NC State Conference of over 100 adult and youth branches across the state.  ”The extremists who racially gerrymandered themselves into power with obscene donations from Art Pope and national secret political societies have now placed their approval on the proven racist system of death in our courthouses.  The Racial Justice Act – which raised the window and turned on the lights on the racism in death penalty cases, was a major step in our efforts to carry out General Order #3, and to achieve “absolute equality of rights” between former masters and slaves.”
“It is not disputed that the repealed Racial Justice Act was a huge success and allowed death row inmates to present overwhelming evidence that the criminal justice system which resulted in their convictions was fatally flawed.  If past cases, where four death row inmates were able to establish the existence of racial bias in jury selection during their trial, are any indication of the evidence which exists in these pending cases, more death sentences will be struck down”, said NC NAACP Lead Attorney Irving Joyner. “It is a ‘down right – dirty shame’ that our political leaders, in light of these past revelations of a systemic breakdown and misuse of our prosecutorial process, chose to destroy a viable remedy, rather than to repair the race-based defects found in the system.  Gov. McCrory’s repeal seeks to make the new law apply retroactively, blunting appeals by death row inmates to assert their discrimination claims. Applying the repeal retroactively is clearly unconstitutional, since it is an ‘ex post facto law.’   This poorly disguised discriminatory attempt to strip the rights of death row inmates will now cost the State substantially more money in legal fees, as it must defend the tea party zealots’ agenda to disregard and diminish the constitutional protections of poor and working people.”
Juneteenth, which should be a day of rejoicing, has been turned into a day of sadness in North Carolina.  Governor McCrory had the opportunity to veto this bill, and separate himself from the Pope-Tea Party zealots who have seized control in the legislature.  Instead, he joined the forces of denial, which see no racism, hear no racism, in the back rooms and court rooms of our legal system of death.  The citizens of North Carolina have not and will not sit by and allow the extremists to take control of the State.  Governor McCrory, you have been put on notice.
The NC NAACP has always opposed the death penalty.  The Racial Justice Act passed in 2009 to allow men and women on death row to change their death sentences to life without parole, if they could prove racial bias in their death sentences.  Irrefutable research has shown that racial bias remains prevalent in North Carolina’s justice system.  Ignoring this fact is an embarrassment to all the people of North Carolina.

The rodeo at the Missouri state fair this weekend demonstrated just how post-racial our society really is, sending a rodeo clown out in a Barack Obama mask as:
Rodeo announcer Mark Ficken, president of the Missouri Cowboy Rodeo Association and a school superintendent, announced a special guest: ""President Obama.""
Working up the crowd, Ficken said, ""We're going to stomp Obama now.""
""As soon as this bull comes out, Obama, don't you move,"" he said. ""He's going to getcha, getcha getcha, getcha.""
A clown on the arena floor chimed in: ""Hey, I know I'm a clown. He's just running around acting like one. Doesn't know he is one.""

That's right, rodeo clown. The president is ""running around"" ignorant of something that's obvious to you. Ha ha ha, the black man got above himself and thinks he's better than a rodeo clown, how dare he, let's get a crowd to cheer at the idea of a bull running him over.
If you read this and are tempted to think ""oh, but this might just be about party and policy, not race,"" consider that ""another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask, pretended to tickle him and played with the lips on the mask."" (And if you were tempted to think this wasn't about race, you haven't been paying attention the past five years or you're just really, really in denial.)
Oh, and in case you missed it, the announcer reveling in the idea of ""stomping"" Obama? That guy is a school superintendent. He's in charge of the education of the children of Boonville, Missouri. Good to know the kind of attitude coming from the top in those schools.

233,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2012/03/20/Ann-Curry-Ambush-Kirk-Cameron,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,NBC's Curry Attacks Kirk Cameron's Religious Beliefs,"

Shorter Ann Curry: Your religious beliefs represent hate speech! 
Make no mistake about it, this is all about going after the Christian Church. Same-sex marriage, GLAAD’s fascist rampages, and all of this Orwellian political correctness is part of a long-term goal:  to make Christian beliefs a form of bigotry and to force a left-wing agenda on the church–all under a Trojan horse labeled “discrimination.” 
In many respects, Obama forcing the Catholic Church to violate its conscience with respect to providing birth control and abortion drugs through their social service institutions is a dry run for this. The left wants to know if they can persuade the American people that a non-existent right (in this case, free birth control) trumps a First Amendment that declaratively restricts the government from impeding the free exercise of religion. 
The obvious next step will be to attempt an end-run around the First Amendmen, by declaring as bigoted the Church’s refusal to marry same-sex couples. They will also attempt to declare as hate speech any belief held by the church that in any way angers GLAAD. 
What Ann Curry did to Kirk Cameron this morning is the first phase of that war: The shaming campaign. On national television, she brought the actor on to declare that his religious belief’s “hate speech” will encourage others to “mistreat gay people.”
We all know what the next step is, and that’s the outlawing of these opinions under the principle that the speaking of such things will cause harm to others.  
This, of course, would mean the end of the church — which is the whole idea.
Newsbusters:
Leading off an interview with conservative Christian actor Kirk Cameron on Tuesday’s NBC Today, co-host Ann Curry immediately attacked him for recent comments he made to CNN’s Piers Morgan: “I’m going to ask you about this firestorm that you set off…on the topic of gay marriage….Many people are suggesting that this is hate speech. Are you encouraging people to feel hate towards gay people?” [Listen to the audio or watch the video after the jump]
Curry plucked out a single sentence from Cameron’s CNN interview: “…you said, quote, ‘I think that it’s unnatural. I think that it’s detrimental and ultimately destructive to so many of the foundations of civilization.'” Cameron called out her selective framing of the topic: “I love all people. I hate no one. And, you know, when you take a subject and you reduce it to something like a four-second sound bite, and a check mark on a ballot, I think that that’s inappropriate and insensitive.”
Even after Cameron explained that the “edited down” quote “certainly didn’t reflect my full heart on the matter,” Curry still asserted he was encouraging hate: “Do you feel any responsibility saying words like that, that might encourage people to feel that it’s okay to treat – mistreat gay people?”
Cameron pushed back and cited Morgan’s blatant bias on the issue: “Nobody should mistreat anybody….what I think this reveals is that – the interviewer that asked me these questions even used the words with me, “I think your views are destructive” – so what that shows me is that all of us who really think deeply about social issues, like gay marriage, and abortion, and homosexuality, have convictions on issues.” 
Ann Curry and Leftists like her don’t give a damn about gays. If they did, you would see the same amount of hostility directed towards Muslims. "

Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) has won a major battle against the politically correct left’s “War on Christmas,” he announced in a press release on Christmas Eve on Tuesday.
Since 1973, U.S. House rules made it an ethics violation for any official congressional communications to contain the phrase “Merry Christmas.” This month, after battling the system for the more than two years since he took office in 2011, Huelskamp was able to get the House to determine it will not consider use of the phrase “Merry Christmas” an ethics violation.
“For decades the PC Police have intimidated Christians throughout America with their attacks on the symbols and language of Christmas,” Huelskamp said in a statement released midday on Christmas Eve. “From nativity scenes to Christmas trees, those opposed to Christmas has sought to eradicate any reason for the season from the public square.  And Congress has not been exempted.”
Huelskamp noted the history of the U.S. House’s War on Christmas before detailing how he has won this battle in the war.
“Amazingly since 1973, the U.S. House of Representatives has forbidden the use of ‘Merry Christmas’ and deemed use of such words in any official mailing or e-mail an ethics violation,” Huelskamp said. “Instead, they demanded the use of ‘Happy Holidays.’ This month, the House Franking Commission accepted the position I have fought for since arriving in Congress–ignore the PC Police and let us use ‘Merry Christmas.'”
Huelskamp added that since 2011, he has fought against the politically correct people in the U.S. Congress who implemented and still attempted to enforce this rule. “In 2011 during an interview on Fox News, I stated my refusal to comply with this decades-old policy, which reflects the continual leftist war on Christmas,” Huelskamp said. 
I have continued that refusal through today, even as it has cowered many other public officials and private industry alike. The new refusal of the U.S. House to cater to the PC Police moves us one small step away from that carefully crafted secular society devoid of any reference to our religious and cultural heritage. I am glad that finally Members of Congress can express their holiday joy in a manner that they see fit and consistent with our American history–without an ethics threat.
Huelskamp ended his statement with a warm Christmas greeting for his constituents and all Americans: “As I have done for the past two years, I personally wish you and all of America a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.”
Merry Christmas, folks.

The New Black Panther Party is in Sanford, Florida organizing rallies and gatherings to be held after the jury reaches a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. The jury began its second day of deliberations on Saturday. 
Jurors are deliberating whether Zimmerman committed second-degree murder when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman has claimed he had to shoot Martin in self-defense. 
The Washington Times noted the group has tweeted, “New Black Panther Party will not give you specific details on anything other than to say we have rallies and street maneuvers planned.” The group has even tweeted about a planned Sept. 7 rally for Trayvon Martin: “We can’t and WON’T try to control the general dissatisfied population. For sure we are ORGANIZING.”
“If Zimmerman is acquitted there is likely to be unrest all over America. It will be way beyond the capacity of the NBPP,” the group tweeted. “From what we are hearing there is a HIGH chance of rebellion across the nation if Zimmerman is acquitted on all charges.”
The Times flagged some tweets that showed the group’s disdain for Zimmerman. The NBPP tweeted that Zimmerman was “exposed on closing arguments as a lying, conniving, manipulating scheming underhanded profiling devil” and that the prosecution’s “withering” closing argument “wiped that smile off his [expletive] face.”
On Friday, Malik Shabazz, Chairman of the the New Black Panther Party, appeared on the David Webb Show on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, which Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon guest-hosted. Shabazz claimed the New Black Panthers are in Sanford because President Barack Obama has encouraged more “traditional” civil rights groups and leaders, like Al Sharpton, to not play active roles in organizing protests during the trial. He said groups like the New Black Panthers have had to replace the more “traditional” civil rights groups who he claimed have been “silenced.”"

Cornel West said that under President Barack Obama there has been an increase in what he called the “new Jim Crow” and claimed his presidency has thus been a failure.
Appearing in a Monday interview on Al Jazeera America’s Talk to Al Jazeera with David Shuster, West said 2.5 million new prisoners have been incarcerated while Obama has been in office mostly “because of soft drugs” and the disparity in “crack cocaine versus regular cocaine” users. West referred to this phenomenon as the “new Jim Crow” because he said minority communities and the poor are disproportionately impacted. 
West blasted the level of corruption on Wall Street that has seen few people to go jail and said there has been a “two-tiered” system of justice under Obama. 
West said that disparity applied to Obama’s economy as well, as corporations have made record profits while there has been “massive unemployment” and “increasing wealth inequality.” He said struggling Americans are “giving up work” or “working part time” in Obama’s economy and those numbers are not reflected in the official unemployment numbers. 
Shuster, conversely, gushed over Obama’s accomplishments, saying Obama’s presidency should be considered a success if his presidency was judged by “morality” because Obama prevented a depression, passed Obamacare, ended the Iraq War, ended “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and appointed the first Latina Supreme Court justice. He continued to defend Obama, saying Obama saved the economy and the unemployment rate would have been worse without Obama. 
But West disagreed, saying Martin Luther King Jr. would not approve of the “vanilla suburbs” at home that symbolize the income inequality that he said has gotten worse since King’s “I Have a Dream Speech” 50 year ago. West acknowledged that Appalachia also had problems with income and crime inequality."

Seems like every young conservative with a phone cam thinks they're James O'Keefe.
Sadly for them, since there's no Andrew Breitbart left to selectively edit and post their handiwork, thereby making it seem a lot more damning than it really is, they're reduced to making even the most obvious, historically inarguable comments by those of us on the left seem controversial.
Just such a thing happened to me this past Wednesday, during my talk at Providence College in Rhode Island. I'll get to the supposedly ""shocking"" video shortly, but first let it be noted that most of the 500 or so in attendance were enthusiastically supportive of the message I delivered regarding the obligation of educational institutions to promote racial equity and representation, by way of deliberate efforts at recruiting and retaining students of color. There had been some controversy at the school recently, thanks to an article in the student paper critiquing the college's diversity plan, and so I weighed in. My argument was really quite un-radical, in truth. I merely explained, drawing on the available evidence, that unless deliberate efforts were made to make Providence a more inclusive place, it would not simply happen on its own, and that highly capable persons of color would continue to be overlooked. And this would happen, not because they were unqualified, but because of the inertia of a K-12 education system that too often provides unequal opportunity to students, such that would allow all students to thrive and even consider Providence, let alone apply and be admitted.
Seriously, in terms of radicalness, it was like a 6.5 on my normal scale.
Follow me beneath the squiggly to find out what happened...


In any event, during the Q&A period things got more interesting. Two conservative students asked me questions -- good, tough questions (and indeed the kind I like getting at these sorts of events) -- and my answers, and our interactions proved grist for the right-wing ""undercover video"" mill, despite how incredibly mild and obviously true my remarks were, to which they took such offense.
One of these was a young woman of color who wanted to know -- given my ""dislike for conservatives and Republicans"" -- what I would say to people of color who were also conservative, such as herself. I explained that I wouldn't say anything different to her than any other conservative. Rather, I asked her, as I would anyone on the right, how she would explain the persistent racial disparities between whites and people of color, if she rejects (as the right does, and as she admitted she did), the notion that racism and discrimination, either past, present, or a combination of the two, were largely to blame.
At no point did she even try and answer my question, because like most conservatives, she cannot; at least not without sounding incredibly racist in the process. Because the only possible answer, if one rejects the discrimination thesis as an explanation for ongoing and glaring disparities in income, wealth, education, and elsewhere between whites and black folks, is inherently racist: namely, that those persons of color must in some way be inferior, either biologically or culturally, relative to whites. I waited with baited breath for her -- a woman of color -- to actually admit that was what she thought. But instead of grappling with the question honestly, she said nothing, beyond her amazing admission that she refuses to accept the simple statement that people of color had ever been disadvantaged in the U.S., or that whites had ever been advantaged, due to racism. In other words, it wasn't just that she insisted America was an equal opportunity society now (say, because of the civil rights revolution), which is at least an understandable and honorable argument, however wrongheaded I might view it to be. Rather, she refused to so much as acknowledge that the history of racism and white supremacy had ever mattered at all. She was the moral equivalent of a Holocaust denier, so fundamentally irrational and uninformed about basic social reality as to call into question how and why a school as good as Providence would have admitted her as a member of its student body. And to think that she was chagrined by affirmative action ostensibly lowering the academic standards of the school on behalf of the other black kids there? Ah, methinks the lady doth protest too much.
But her friend and conservative colleague's question -- actually it was a statement -- was even more interesting. She claimed that I was ""anthropologically reductionist"" (one of those word casseroles that we learn in college and that some sadly deploy just to show how smart they are), for even noticing something like race. She, on the other hand, in the throes of a deeper (and Scriptural) enlightenment merely saw ""people"" when she looked around, not colors, and especially ""people made in the image of God."" Cue the harps and Vienna Boy's Choir.
In response, I told her first that such a sentiment was lovely, but, I thought naive. Mostly because even if we accept the notion that we are all merely individuals made in the image of God, the fact is, our identities as whites or people or color, men or women, straight folks or LGBT, have mattered, and have resulted in advantages for some and disadvantages for others. In other words, we can't treat people as abstractions, removed from their social context and consider that justice. If racism has had consequences -- which of course her black friend refused to admit, so no doubt one can understand her confusion -- then one must deal with that, and attempt to rectify the injustices that have brought us to this point, not merely gloss over them in the name of some colorblind ecumenism, thereby leaving in place all the unearned advantages obtained by some and unearned disadvantages visited upon the rest. She was, in short, guilty of viewing individuals using a dictionary definition of the term, when what we actually experience in this world in the lives we lead, is an encyclopedic version of ourselves, far more complex than either the dictionary, or certainly the Bible might lead us to believe.
But what I also said -- and which apparently created such a firestorm -- was the part where I noted that however nice it was to prattle on about people being made in the image of God, that even there, we have a problem in this culture, given how we have created the image of that God to match whiteness. In other words, we have made God white, and Jesus white, as could be seen on any number of crucifixes (or is it crucifi?) around this Catholic campus, including one that was hanging right behind my head while I spoke: a lily-white, Europeanized savior, devoid of any relationship to what first century Jews would have looked like. Until my questioner was prepared to deal with that, and why we had done that, and what it meant, she really was in no position to lecture me about my anthropological reductionism or anything else.
One would think that any reasonably educated person would realize that the whitening of Jesus was an act of white supremacy, undertaken down through many centuries for the purpose of inculcating western and European domination. Constantine, after all, said that the cross was the sign under which he would conquer, not liberate, the world. My comments are not remotely contestable by rational people. But in the eyes of Providence College conservatives, they were heresy of the highest order.
And so today I discovered that someone in the crowd apparently provided a video of my talk to well-known white nationalist (as in, openly so), and Providence resident, Tim Dionisopoulos, and that he had written about it and uploaded it to the web. Therein, Dionisopoulos took special umbrage at my discussion of the white Jesus issue, as if my comments were the height of craziness. And he made special note of the part where I joked that the school should make Jesus black for a year, just to show that his color ""really doesn't matter"" (which is what white Christians always tell me when I bring up his whitening, as if to suggest I shouldn't make a big deal of it). Apparently, some folks think I was being serious and that my comment (obviously intended to lampoon their own unblinking devotion to his pasty whiteness on their campus crosses) suggested some kind of anti-Catholic bias.
The videographers also found it shocking, just shocking that I would suggest the Catholic Church (and really, Christendom more broadly), had been deeply implicated in the genocidal mistreatment of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas. This revelation comes as no surprise to anyone who has studied the history of native peoples, or the church for that matter; indeed, even the Church no longer denies it, though they rarely deal honestly with its implications. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, for instance, has itself noted the history, however bloodlessly as such:
Catholicism's spread to Native people across the United States resembles in many ways the settling of the country itself. From the earliest days French and Spanish missionaries who came to this world newly discovered by Europeans came as extensions of the colonizing powers. The approach was, in many cases, to force the Natives to accept the faith as part of the process of servitude…
The history of the Alta California missions are instructive here. These were settlements established by Spanish colonizers so as to rapidly assimilate native peoples there into both European culture and Catholicism, under the belief of the Church that it had a moral right to evangelize and that the Spanish crown had a legal right to land. The missions operated by forcibly resettling indigenous persons around the mission itself so as ""convert them"" not only from so-called heathens into Catholics, but from savages to civilized peoples, in European terms. Once Indians were Baptized they were disallowed the right to move about the country; rather, they were forced to work at the missions, under the rigid control of the Friars. Indian women, in particular, were housed in such unsanitary conditions at the missions that diseases spread rapidly, resulting in the deaths of thousands. Contemporaries writing at the time noted without compunction that the labor conditions at the missions resembled slavery, and since the native peoples were unpaid for their work -- work that ultimately enriched the Catholic Church and the colonial powers with which the Church was entwined -- such an analogy is obviously warranted.
Elsewhere the Church contributed directly to the cultural and even physical evisceration of indigenous Americans, in ways that any truly educated person in this country would know, were our schools dedicated to the teaching of anything remotely comporting with truth. For a comprehensive accounting of the evil done in the name of God to indigenous peoples, one need only read George Tinker's Missionary Conquest: The Gospel and Native American Cultural Genocide, or David Stannard's meticulously documented, American Holocaust, to see that my comments at Providence, far from indicating a bias against Catholicism, fully dovetail with historical fact, however inconvenient those facts may be for a school that has chosen ""Friars"" as its sports mascot.
That today's campus conservatives think challenging the phony whiteness of Jesus, or noting the history of the church's role in racism makes one a radical is instructive. It speaks to what an utterly sheltered, provincial and fundamentally ignorant world view these persons have been given heretofore, by their parents, high schools, priests and preachers, and by a larger society that has no room for any understanding of America and Christianity that isn't laudatory. Their inability to hear of evil, let alone address it, is rendered all the less likely by such a sheltering, and their ability to engage in even the simplest rational dialogue with others, or even with history, is made almost impossible.
The good news is, the school is pushing forward with its diversity initiative, and nearly everyone in attendance at the talk cringed and groaned openly at the foolishness of their classmates, there on display. So one can only hope that even at a school like Providence, this too shall pass.

With a happy Iran at the negotiating table and plenty of reasons to take the spotlight off health care, the Obama administration now seeks to tie the hands of political opponents by limiting spending by tax-exempt groups with political messages.
The Treasury and IRS announced they were currently working on adapting the tax code to limit what kinds of groups could apply for 501(c)(4) status, a category designated for political non-profits and “social welfare” groups that follow less stringent spending rules than political action committees (PACs). The Obama administration’s proposed changes to the code would prevent 501(c)(4)s from engaging in advocacy for a specific candidate and political advocacy generally, including paying for campaign ads on television. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur called the move “a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations.”
Unlike PACs, 501(c)(4)s do not currently have to disclose donors legally. They have surpassed unions and trade associations in political spending and become a pivotal part of the post-Citizens United campaign finance landscape. They do not aid candidates directly, but take on issues and buy ads that directly argue to the public one way or another. While the groups can be of any political stripe, spending by conservative groups has greatly surpassed that by liberal organizations like Organizing for America. And although the measure would crack down on bigger organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, the strength of smaller, Tea Party-central advocacy groups who rely on their tax exempt status to promote messages mainstream political figures would otherwise ignore would most likely be among the hardest hit.
Conservatives both complying with the law in their roles running 501(c)(4)s and those in office have responded to the measure with uniform outrage. A spokesman for the NRA, a 501(c)(4), called the measure a “blatant abuse of the tax code designed to muzzle the American people’s free speech rights.” Rep. Darrell Issa described the move as a “crass political effort,” and placed emphasis on the fact that unions and trade organizations– often much more likely to contribute to liberal efforts– were left to their own devices while the IRS and Treasury turned on these particular political non-profits.
This isn’t the first time the IRS proposes to crack down on political groups voicing opposition to President Obama’s policies, but it is the most sweeping attempt. Controversy with such groups came to a peak this year when it was discovered that more than 80% of 501(c)(4) groups on the IRS’ watch list between 2010 and 2012 were conservative and/or Tea Party affiliated organizations. 
While the administration promises careful scrutiny of the tax code before making any large changes, President Obama’s vocal disapproval of the expressive freedoms protected by the Citizens United ruling and his administration’s targeting of opposition groups through the IRS leave little room to expect tax reforms to have anything but a chilling effect on the national political discourse. "

Over at the Atlantic Garance Franke-Ruta has a thoughtful article arguing that the GOP’s current “war on women” response is ill-considered at best.
Five different Republican committees this morning released a joint memo
pushing back on the “Democrats’ War on Women” messaging to highlight
the sex scandals of a group of Democratic men and argue that Democrats
are hypocrites who only care about women when it is politically
convenient.

It’s a fine message as far as it goes, which is as a kind of a summer
doldrums GOP base-riling play, reminding Republican women that there
are a bunch of Democratic men out there who they — and others! — think
are creeps.
Two things about this. First, Democrats underestimate how much stuff like this really gets under the skin of people on the other side. The entire “war on women” campaign is offensive to GOP women and to men who have wives and daughters. 
But making a political point by crafting an obnoxious bit of hyperbole is something Democrats excel at lately. Whether it’s comparing the GOP to hijackers or terrorists over budget negotiations, the party has fully embraced argument by demonization. I’m not talking about a loose comment here or there, which always happens on both sides, I mean a coordinated campaign from the top down which includes the President. 
Franke-Ruta argues that instead of acting on our entirely justifiable irritation with the left’s obnoxious memes we should design a more reasoned campaign built around women and security issues. I think it’s well intended and probably even a good idea. But–and this is point two–it fails to appreciate the extent to which policy arguments are merely backdrops for more energetic attacks in our elections these days.
To give a current example, these “no slutbags” flyers appearing around NYC are going to do more to hurt Anthony Weiner than any policy argument about his 64 points for a strong middle class. And the same applies to the 2012 election. 
The left is kidding itself if it thinks the “war on women” was about expanded funding for birth control. It was about Rush calling Sandra Fluke a slut. That was the headline and the source of outrage onto which all the policy baggage was later loaded. Similarly, Todd Akin’s comments about rape did more to make the war on women a reality than any policy papers posted by the DNC. Populist outrage first, policy backstopping afterwards. 
Don’t believe me? Have a look at this move on ad from last year. Notice the focus is on offensive statements not policy arguments. In fact, American Crossroads tried to respond
with their own “war on women” policy arguments, not
unlike what Franke-Ruta is suggesting the GOP try now. But as we all
know, those arguments did not get nearly the same level of media or popular traction. 
Rush and Akin’s comments are to Democratic cultural politics what Jaws was to movies about killer sharks. The fascination on the left may have devolved into Sharknado-level parody by now, but there’s no doubting that a new genre was spawned. And to extend that metaphor, there’s no point responding to these memes with policy prescriptions anymore than there is giving the Sharknado sequel a stern and serious negative review. There is no policy response to “binders full of women.” None that matters. 
Filner, Weiner and Spitzer give the GOP an easy (and potentially effective) opportunity to respond in kind. It may not be a reasoned policy argument but as we
learned in 2012 that’s not what wins elections."

Voting in Hartford, Connecticut, on November 6, 2012

I have to admit that rather than being angry about Republican attempts to lure black voters by twisting and spinning and blatantly lying about who they are as a party and who and what they stand for, I have been watching their contortions with an almost unholy glee.
They have had it so easy fogging the minds of low-information white folks who consist on a steady diet of Fox news, conspiracy theory, and panic-driven racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia, that blinded by buying their own propaganda and bigotry, they have bought the package they sell and continue to make futile attempts to steer us ""blah"" folks to vote for them, even as they spit on us in public on a daily basis.
Their ""intellectual"" theorists from the Buckley minions at The National Review, their bloated, bloviating media mouthpieces and money-men, are facing a dark future with few of us of darker in hue voting for the Party of R in the years ahead, and no tactic, stratagem or game plan they come up with from the depths of warped-by-hate brain pans seems to work. Gotta hand it to 'em—they keep trying. Read how below the fold.


My latest loud guffaw came while reading ""Conservatives Try to Rewrite Civil Rights History (Again)"" which opened with:
Rand Paul’s unsuccessful speech at Howard University—where he tried, and failed, to paint the Republican Party as the true home for African American voters—didn’t happen in a vacuum. It drew from a heavily revisionist history of American politics, in which the GOP never wavered in its commitment to black rights, and the Democratic Party embraced its role as a haven for segregationists. In this telling of history, black support for Democrats is a function of liberal demagoguery and crude identity politics. If African Americans truly understood their interests, the argument goes, they’d have never left the Republican Party.
The piece went on to explore recent attempts at re-writing racist southern-strategy architect Barry Goldwater's contributions to black folks.  
Write-on R's. You will write in vain.  
We don't need degrees in political science, or to read right-wing bloggers to know our history. Many of us had Republican grandparents. I know I did, and wrote about it. Black folks talk about politics in barber shops, beauty parlors, sittin' on bar stools, on the bus on the way to work and around the dinner table. We don't form our opinions based on punditry. We deal with the daily reality of walking, eating, sleeping, working, driving, shopping and breathing while black.
Black people are not stupid.
The R's have convinced themselves that the last two national election cycles are some sort of aberration, that just because Democrats had some black guy at the top of the ticket black folks blissed out and will come to our senses once he is no longer the Democrats' standard bearer. They are completely ignoring the fact that black folks have been voting for white Democrats since FDR started luring us away from the R party of old a long time ago.
Sure, they can buy off a few dusky faces to spout their rhetoric. Just see how well choosing Michael Steele worked out for ya. Opportunists come in all colors. Pasting a dark visage on tainted ideology does nothing to mask the stench of rotting food for thought.  
Black people are not stupid.
Nor have we been struck blind, deaf and senseless. We hear dog whistling and the dulcet tones of patronizing put-downs quite well, thank you.
We may not all be PhDs, but a degree from the university of the streets serves us well—we have learned the hard way how to survive in a hostile America. We begin learning the day we are born, drink it in with our mother's milk or formula and before we are in the second or third grade we learn daily lessons in blackness.
You have Bell-Curve'd us, and Willie Horton'ed us, and Welfare Queen'ed us, as you stand-your-ground and stop-and-frisk us.  
The latest cause for R hand-wringing and lamentation and attempts at re-invention is the much touted poll on black voter turnout, surpassing whites.
Even news stories questioning the data results conclude:
Data-parsing aside, what’s clear is that in the last two presidential elections, blacks and whites turned out at roughly the same rate. Coming less than 50 years after systematic efforts to prevent blacks from voting were banned by the Voting Rights Act, that’s a historic milestone. The Supreme Court is set to rule in June on whether to strike down a key provision of the 1965 law.
The news also bolsters the case that the Republican effort to make voting harder for racial minorities—including strict photo ID laws, cutbacks to early voting, and purges of voting rolls—may have backfired, by stoking outrage in the African-American community in particular.
“It made the case very clear-cut to people about what was happening,” Marvin Randolph, the NAACP’s vice president for campaigns, told MSNBC.com. “We could say to people: This is a poll tax.”
“Politics is a lot like physics,” Randolph added.  ”Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.”

Yeah. 'Cause we are not stupid we have a re-action. We've been reacting for many years. From slave rebellions, resistance and revolts, through the tough years of reconstruction into the anti-lynching organizing and civil rights movement, we've fought, pushed-back and died. We are not stupid. Republicans aren't the ""party of Lincoln."" We know where the Dixiecrats fled to. We've watched you eat your own and cast them out when they even approach something resembling reason.  
Republican attempts to limit our hard won right to vote just adds fuel to the fire. And they ain't stopping.
Ari Berman in The Nation last week reported on new voter repression legislation proposed and introduced for 2013 :

• Mandating a government-issued photo ID to cast a ballot: Arkansas, Connecticut, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Washington, Wyoming
• Restricting voter registration drives: Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Mexico, Virginia
• Banning election-day voter registration: California, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska
• Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote: Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia
• Purging the voter rolls: Colorado, Indiana, New Mexico, Texas, Virginia
• Reducing early voting: Arizona, Indiana, South Carolina, Texas, Wisconsin
• Disenfranchising ex-felons: Virginia.

Oh, and by the way: Latinos and Native Americans don't cotton to the nickname Tonto. That may have worked well for the Lone Ranger and his ""sidekick"" Indian buddy who was named ""stupid"" on tee-vee in the 50's, but promoting Marco Rubio as a patently obvious ploy to get a flood of browns to swamp the voting booths for you ain't gonna happen.  
As my Puerto Rican husband said yesterday, ""Nosotros no somos estúpidos.""
So we'll be gathered together under the Democratic party big tent, seeking shelter from the acidic rain of the Republican hate-fest for the forseeable future.
Guess who is stupid?

Scholars and students of film often use the phrase “breaking the fourth wall.”
This is the moment when suspension of disbelief is removed, and the film “winks” at the audience in a moment where the latter are made to realize that what they are seeing is not real, and its creators (and actors) are choosing to obey—or break—genre conventions.
Scholars who study race and racial ideologies often talk about how in the post civil rights United States racism has moved from what they call “the front stage” (the public and the readily seen) to the “backstage” (what is more hidden and private).
Consequently, being called a “racist” is the impetus for public shaming and exile. In response, white racism has moved to private spaces, uses humor and comedy as a shield, and takes refuge online.
Food celebrity Paula Deen’s admission in a recent anti-discrimination lawsuit that she routinely uses racial slurs such as “nigger”, and how she yearns for a return to Jim and Jane Crow America, is an almost perfect moment where she broke the metaphorical fourth wall of racism in the Age of Obama.
In her deposition she explained how:
[W]hen asked if she wanted black men to play the role of slaves at a wedding she explained she got the idea from a restaurant her husband and her had dined at saying, “The whole entire waiter staff was middle-aged black men, and they had on beautiful white jackets with a black bow tie.
“I mean, it was really impressive. That restaurant represented a certain era in America…after the Civil War, during the Civil War, before the Civil War…It was not only black men, it was black women…I would say they were slaves.”
Such images remain potent in American popular culture. And for some white folks of a certain age, as well as those possessed of a conservative, Right-wing political orientation, such images embody “real America”, and a ""simpler"" time before black and brown folks ""forgot their place"", the gays and lesbians came out of the closet, and women embraced feminism.
Paula Deen also embodies the moment of “race and reunion” that occurred after America’s Civil War. In the aftermath of a conflict which took at least 750,000 lives, whites in the North and former Confederacy had to find a way to come together as a whole and intact political community.
The solution: reimagining the Confederacy’s illegal acts of treason and secession as a noble lost cause.
North and South were both invested in White Supremacy and creating a society wherein African-Americans were a subordinated and dominated class of people.
Race and reunion involved a rewriting of American history such that slavery was remade into a benign and civilizing institution: the plantation was an idyllic and wonderful place. In this twisted vision, African-Americans, especially men, would descend into idleness, rapine behavior, and be a threat to white civilization unless they were controlled by violence and lynch law.
This lie of a noble and idyllic South, with its happy loyal slaves, continues to cast a shadow over post civil rights America.
For example, movies such as Gone with the Wind remain popular. Civil War reenactors march off as members of the Confederacy; they see themselves as good men involved in a futile struggle—not as agents defending white supremacy and racial terrorism. Award winning music groups such as Lady Antebellum channel a nostalgic view of the pre-Civil War South through the white racial frame in order to depict a historical milieu of white supremacy that ought to be yearned and pined for by their audiences.
Ultimately, Paula Deen’s desires are White yearnings for black subordination and submission.
As the Jim Crow Museum details, the black mammy maid figure is a lie which does the social and political work of convincing white people that black women (and other people of color) live to serve them. The black butler or Tom figure does similar work. They are both two-dimensional characters who are asexual, robbed of their full humanity, and eager to serve white people.  
Such figures remain iconic. See the caricatures Uncle Ben and Aunt Jemima in almost every American supermarket.
Stories of resistance to these White fantasies are also removed from the dreams of Paula Deen and the White conservatives who yearn for a return to “real America.”
Those happy smiling black maids were also peeing in food and taking their monies to help support the nascent Civil Rights movement. Nameless black butlers and Pullman Car porters—those men named “George”—were freedom fighters readying to resist and mobilize against White Supremacy.
The election of the country’s first black president is symbolically potent. Paula Deen’s desire for a return to Jim and Jane Crow is a reflection of a broader anxiety among the White American body politic and collective subconscious.
There, black and brown folks should be maids and butlers. A black family is in the White House. America’s demographics are changing because of immigration. Therefore, a particular type of Whiteness feels particularly imperiled in this social and political moment. Whatever one thinks of Obama's policies, for a good portion of Red State America, it is the fact of his personhood and blackness that is the real affront and crime.
What is the result? Movies and TV shows that emphasize the destruction of America and the White House since the election of Barack Obama. There are also forthcoming historical biopics such as The Butler about a noble black servant who served a series of presidents in the White House across several decades. TV shows such as Devious Maids fulfill the type-casting and stereotype of Hispanics and Latinas as natural servants.
Paula Deen’s fantasy of black and brown compliance, surrender, and subordination has connections to some of the country’s most ugly moments since the election of Barack Obama.
Birtherism, and Republican Joe Wilson's heckling of President Barack Obama during his State of the Union Address in 2009 is a parallel to Paula Deen’s fantasy.
Conspiranoid fantasies of Secession and a second Civil War are also part of this national derangement on the part of the White Right and Tea Party GOP. The murder of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, and how Republicans have rallied to Zimmerman's defense, is a reflection of a foundational assumption that black people must always be subservient, and surrender to White authority--as well as those overly identified and enamored with it--in any circumstance.
Projecting forward, at the end of her saga Paula Deen will be forced to publicly apologize for her racism. In that moment, and keeping with script, she will also channel some tears in order to get back into the good graces of her fans.
I believe that Paula Deen should be given an award for being so real and transparent about her racial attitudes. She exposed the backstage of white racism in post civil rights America.
Paula Deen is not alone in her feelings; Paula Deen's biggest sin is that she was just too honest and forthright  for her own good.

Republicans might not give a damn about women, but at least they give a damn about winning in 2014. Via The Hill:
Several House Republicans are signaling support for the once-controversial Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a development that carries political ramifications as the GOP seeks to repair its image among female voters in time for 2014.
This is really starting to look pathetic. House Republicans allowed VAWA to expire last year because they considered it unacceptable that ""women"" should include lesbians, immigrants and Native American women. So once again, the Senate overwhelmingly—and yes, with bipartisan support—passed it. And once again, House Republicans just aren't sure if they can bring themselves to even hold a vote on it.
But at least, according to The Hill, some Republicans are starting to think about how opposing this heretofore uncontroversial legislation might have some negative side effects. Like, say, on Election Day in 2014. West Virginia Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, for example, said, ""It is far, far past due to reauthorize VAWA."" Gee, ya think?
Capito and a handful of other House Republicans are suggesting that maybe they should get over themselves and their weak-tea objections to the Senate's bill, but it's not as if they've had a change of heart and suddenly want to embrace those very women they've been saying do not deserve protection from rape and abuse. Republicans aren't about to have a change of heart on non-white non-straight women. But this just might be reason enough for them to have a change of heart on the bill:
The 2012 election cycle saw Republicans up and down the ballot face accusations that they were “out of touch” on women’s issues — a Democratic argument that gained traction with voters following inopportune comments about rape and pregnancy by Republican Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana.
National exit polling showed 55 percent of women voted for House Democratic candidates, compared to 45 percent who supported House Republicans.
The presidential race saw an identical gender gap in favor of President Obama.

Yeah. Turns out the Republicans' War on Women did not bode well for Republicans in the last election, and if they don't do something to change the perception that, you know, they're bad for women, they just might be looking at another gaping gender gap in next year's election.
That's the ugly reality House Republicans are starting to accept—especially those blue state Republicans who will be particularly vulnerable in 2014—which is why they sent a letter this week calling on their party leadership to hold a vote and pass the damn bill already. So will they?
Boehner on VAWA: ""No decision"" yet on whether the House will take up the Senate bill or move our own version.
— @jbendery via web



Yeah. Don't hold your breath. Instead, sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act.

For the second quarter in a row, progressive cable news channel MSNBC has been hit with the unpleasant news that it's ratings have fallen and it now trails behind FOX and CNN in all the important demographics.


At first this drop in popularity was explained away by the fact that we're not in an election year and liberal partisans aren't as interested in following the news once the contest has been settled. Other critics have said the problem is that MSNBC has become too tame and too cerebral by adding shows like ""All In"" with Chris Hayes to its prime time line-up and moving its firebrand hosts like Ed Schultz to Saturday obscurity.
I'm sure those reasons, and probably some others I can't think of have contributed to MSNBC's precipitous decline, but they are not why I've stopped watching the cable news channel on a regular basis. The fact is that as a liberal Democrat, I can't keep walking around in a constant state of impotent rage, it's literally killing me. Watching MSNBC every night only reinforces the fact that the Republican led House,  Republican led state governments and the Republican-centric Supreme Court are sending this country to hell in a handbasket and there doesn't seem to be a bleepin' thing any of us, particularly elected Democrats, can do to stop it.
As much as I admire Rachel Maddow, and next to Jon Stewart, I think she's the best thing on television, I can no longer bear to hear her excellent and thorough analysis each night of how the ""red"" states are dismantling women's rights, shredding civil rights, denying voting rights and imposing their own brand of Sharia law in legislatures that have more in common with banana republics than the constitutional democracies they are supposed to represent. It turns out that ignorance is bliss, or at least it's not the gut-wrenching, stress-filled sense of hopelessness and dispair you get from having your attention riveted nightly on inequities that you are powerless to fix.
I mean really, how many protest marches do we join, petitions do we sign, or phone calls do we make before we accept the fact that our actions have less of an impact on the laws being passed to govern our lives than a gnat landing on the back of an elephant. It turns out that watching the destruction of our democracy with charts and graphs and color commentary on television every night is a soul killing experience and it's better for my health if I avoid it.
This, of course is what separates us from right-wing conservatives. Unlike us wussy progressives, they thrive on their anger, losing an argument only fuels their hatred and whets their appetite. FOX News stays at number one in the ratings whether their candidates lose an election, or a court decision goes against them, or their majority in the house fails to derail Obamacare. In fact, watching their set-backs and disappointments paraded on TV and explained as unjust results of a liberal conspiracy only makes them grow stronger and more irrational in their sense of purpose.
Not so for me. I simply can't continue to spend my days and evenings consumed with ineffectual fury. Tuning into a nightly, technicolor recap of the decimation of social and civil rights issues that were already argued and settled a half a century ago isn't illuminating my perspective, it's breaking my heart.

President Barack Obama talking about race? Uh oh, lots of heads exploding in conservative America.  

As you'll see below the fold, wingnutopia didn't take this very well, proving once again that the notion of ""rebranding"" for the GOP is DOA. They are the racist white American party. Not all Republicans are racist, but all racists are Republican.



As you read these, just a random sample out of 1,600 when I last looked (almost all expressing similar sentiments), remember the popular conservative claim that it's Obama who is the racist one...
He just can't keep his emotions in check or mouth shut... Obama's racist tendency is shining bright today....
Coming from a half white man... Barry, STFU.
barry's preferred target is the Constitution, and the Constitution is incapable of self-defense. At least Trayvon attacked something capable of fighting back. That puts Trayvon one step above barry in my book.
Seriously? A more ""perfect"" union? This country is getting more divided by the day thanks to BO.
All I see now are blacks running rampant looking for an excuse to loot and terrorize. GG BO for setting blacks back a couple more decades.

He isn't going to be happy until we have a full-blown race war.
What an idiot.
Congratulations Amerika. You elected this clown TWICE!

He wants a race war, and when Whitey finally fights back that's when DHS gets to use their shiny new toys.
Darn right he is divisive!
But a majority of the Black population is too.
Tell you what Mr. President, if you don't like our legal system, why not move to another country, and take your Racist supporters with you!
Whites aren't racist, they are tired of African Americans being slothful, violent, criminal, and milking the system because they squandered their free public education, and refused to learn to read, write, do arithmetic, and speak English.
Blacks are their own worst enemy!
John Derbyshire was fired when He warned Whites to stay away from Blacks.For those too stupid to follow his advice will find out what it is like to try and carry a cat home by his tail.
Aw what'sa matter, Obama? You didn't get all the mobs and deaths you wanted out of this verdict? Not enough looting and plundering and blood for you?
It was bad enough when you tacitly called on the black community to take revenge on Zimmerman by declaring that he had murdered 'your son'. Now you're saying that Zimmerman murdered YOU - and you're silently calling on all your political lovers to go out and get even on everyone else because of your 'unjust death'.
Obama - you really are a cad. I would say shame on you, but you've proven already with your greedy and wicked life that you have no shame. The sooner you are cast out of office, the better.

Repeatedly, in his own words in his own books and speeches, Obama (and most of the 96% of blacks who are Democrats) are irrational, racist, socialists who commit the majority of all crime in America in and out of government.
What do you get when a Community Organizer raised in Indonesian madrassas, tutored by Frank Marshall Davis, and mentored by Jeremiah Wright for 20 years gets reelected President?
CIVIL RACE WARS 2013

Well it’s a Fact Obama is a racist no more hiding it Barry, to
all you guilt feeling libs and to all the Hispanics that voted for him enjoy
your President you are now consider White Hispanic so you get to bend over and hold your ankles like the white folks, hope and change more like racist and violence, only in a America a violent thug is honored like a hero, but only if you’re a black thug White /
Hispanics have to answer for their crimes, Race War coming soon thanks to Obama,
and the libs are so happy but the truth is you will be the first ones taken out,
Blacks don’t really like you and hardworking Whites and Hispanics hate you also Vote Racist Vote Black.
MORE LIKELY...LIAR N' CHIEF...YOU COULD HAVE BEEN HIM...HAD NOT THE NWO BILDERBERG PICKED YOU OUT OF OBSCURITY...TO PROMOTE YOU TO THE HIGHEST POSITION IN OUR LAND...THROUGH LIES AND DECEPTIONS!
You have been bred to be where you are...you are a puppet of the NWO...working to take America down...and we know who you are...and what you are...a traitor to America...NOT a uniter of men...but a divider of men!
The descriptive names that I have given you throughout the last (5) years denote your intent and who you are.
YOU ARE...the Liar N' Chief...the Chameleon N' Chief...the FlimFlam Obamaman...the NWO Bilderberg..Obama the Bush and now just known as the 'massa' in the big house!
Yessir...we have your number and it is up in 2016!

Trayvon got what he deserved. More thugs need the get the same. Obama, you're full of $hit as a Christmas turkey.
You need to resign and go back to Indonesia and, while you're at it, take that chimpanzee of a wife with you.
IMPEACH Obama...REMOVE and IMPRISON the entire cabinet and all political appointees

I'm so sick of this jacka** inserting race and himself into every situation that involves an african American-yet he's silent, you can even hear crickets chirping, if the incident involves a Caucasian.
His very statement about the outcome and aftermath being different had it been a white male is a moot point.
Had it been a white male it would have never even been covered by the national media and that's because there are no white counterparts to the tag team duo of obama and sharpton to bring up the race issue which they are so masterfully skilled at.
Like Clint Eastwood said to Spike Lee-""HE NEEDS TO SHUT HIS FACE.""
How long did it take Obama to speak out ON BEHALF of the four American heroes killed in Benghazi? What did he do to impact their deaths? Dis he have holder change nay of our laws? Did he support any protests? Short Answer: NO!
Is this country going to survive the race and socioeconomic wars this administration seems intent upon bringing on all of us? The President has clearly drawn lines in the sand with these comments, setting us up for a black against white race war. How can we have a ""more perfect union"" when the President has done this kind of race-baiting?
Let me count the times I threw up a little in my mouth when I watched that SOB give that speech. Nothing like watching a dictator try to humble himself knowing that his little plan for Zimmerman didn't work out.
Obama should have edumacated the black masses instead of blowing smoke up their bungholios... trayvon profiled Zimmerman... assaulted him... because he thought he was gay... that is testimony from Jeantel on the witness stand and in interviews on CNN and msnbs...
No surprise the black community has to ignore the facts to justify their childish and uneducated reaction to the truth.
YOU WONDER WHY THIS SCREWBALL COMES OUT WITH THIS, TILL YOU SEE THAT CONGRESS IS LOOKING INTO THE ADMINISTRATION GETTING THE BENGHAZI SURVIVORS TO SIGN A NON DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT............

giving the 'black boys' the go ahead to crack some cr@ckers!!!
better watch yourselves and your families... I know I will be!
Yesterday I was saying to myself, this weekend probably wouldn't be that bad,
now I am very concerned about the animals that will be running around trying to vindicate POtuS' statements!!!!
REALLY!?!?!? You just can't let this go can you?! You've got to stir the racial pot because your presidency has been a complete and utter FAILURE!!!!!
Obamacare and the auto bailout are imploding and we have to listen to this CRAP!
What a POS ideologue!! What an absolute embarrassment! Undeserving of the office of the presidency, posturing to representing not the country but his particular race (or at least the one he identifies with)!!
If I had a petty dictator of a president he would be Barrack Obama.

This is only a diversion so you won't think about the real problems such as the IRS and Benghazi. As long as we are bickering about Trayvon, we tend to forget about the important things
Sigh...

With a happy Iran at the negotiating table and plenty of reasons to take the spotlight off health care, the Obama administration now seeks to tie the hands of political opponents by limiting spending by tax-exempt groups with political messages.
The Treasury and IRS announced they were currently working on adapting the tax code to limit what kinds of groups could apply for 501(c)(4) status, a category designated for political non-profits and “social welfare” groups that follow less stringent spending rules than political action committees (PACs). The Obama administration’s proposed changes to the code would prevent 501(c)(4)s from engaging in advocacy for a specific candidate and political advocacy generally, including paying for campaign ads on television. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Mark Mazur called the move “a first critical step toward creating clear-cut definitions of political activity by tax-exempt social welfare organizations.”
Unlike PACs, 501(c)(4)s do not currently have to disclose donors legally. They have surpassed unions and trade associations in political spending and become a pivotal part of the post-Citizens United campaign finance landscape. They do not aid candidates directly, but take on issues and buy ads that directly argue to the public one way or another. While the groups can be of any political stripe, spending by conservative groups has greatly surpassed that by liberal organizations like Organizing for America. And although the measure would crack down on bigger organizations like Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS, the strength of smaller, Tea Party-central advocacy groups who rely on their tax exempt status to promote messages mainstream political figures would otherwise ignore would most likely be among the hardest hit.
Conservatives both complying with the law in their roles running 501(c)(4)s and those in office have responded to the measure with uniform outrage. A spokesman for the NRA, a 501(c)(4), called the measure a “blatant abuse of the tax code designed to muzzle the American people’s free speech rights.” Rep. Darrell Issa described the move as a “crass political effort,” and placed emphasis on the fact that unions and trade organizations– often much more likely to contribute to liberal efforts– were left to their own devices while the IRS and Treasury turned on these particular political non-profits.
This isn’t the first time the IRS proposes to crack down on political groups voicing opposition to President Obama’s policies, but it is the most sweeping attempt. Controversy with such groups came to a peak this year when it was discovered that more than 80% of 501(c)(4) groups on the IRS’ watch list between 2010 and 2012 were conservative and/or Tea Party affiliated organizations. 
While the administration promises careful scrutiny of the tax code before making any large changes, President Obama’s vocal disapproval of the expressive freedoms protected by the Citizens United ruling and his administration’s targeting of opposition groups through the IRS leave little room to expect tax reforms to have anything but a chilling effect on the national political discourse. "

An April 2013 email from a career Department of Homeland Security official released on Friday by the office of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) stated that the Department of Homeland Security “absolutely gave special treatment” to green card visa applications filed by foreign national EB-5 investors in GreenTech Automotive, the company Virginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe served as chairman of from 2010 to 2012.
In the released email, the names of the sender as well as the recipient have been redacted, but both are described as “career DHS officials.” The text of the email also refers to a person called “D1,” which Senator Grassley’s office believes is US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director Alejandro Mayorkas. President Obama nominated Mayorkas to become Deputy Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security on June 27. 
Mr. Mayorkas testified before a Senate committee holding hearings on his nomination on July 25. The hearings were attended by only Democrats. Republicans did not participate because Mr. Mayorkas is the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office.
The email, dated April 12, 2013, is from a “Senior USCIS Career Official” and is sent to “USCIS Career Officials.” It reads as follows:
We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the directive of D1. D1 was working directly with the RC’s [EB-5 Regional Center] atty, [name redacted]. Additionally, I would call a wholesale rewrite of the AAO’s [Administrative Appeals Office] decision by the front office special treatment. Look at the first draft in the attached email and the final version, attached.
Senator Grassley asked Mr. Mayorkas about an apparent inconsistency between this email and his earlier testimony in a letter he sent to Mr. Mayorkas on Thursday. Grassley wrote to Mayorkas that “you testified [on July 25]: ‘I have never ever in my career exercised undue influence to influence the outcome of a case.'” Grassley noted in his letter to Mayorkas that “D1 [mentioned in the April 12, 2013 email] is an apparent reference to you.” 
Grassley then cited Mayorkas’ testimony to the Senate committee on July 25:
Several documents call into question some of the statements you made regarding preferential treatment in your testimony at last Thursday’s hearing. For example, you were asked in the hearing about communications with Terry McAuliffe with respect to Gulf Coast Funds Management. You testified: “I was asked to attend a meeting with Mr. McAuliffe so that I could hear in person his complaints… two years ago… I heard those complaints, and that was the extent of the interaction… I moved on with my work.” (Emphasis included in Grassley letter)
But, Grassley wrote, “Contrary to the impression left by your answer, documents indicate that both before and after that meeting, you actually engaged in nearly a dozen contacts with Gulf Coast Funds Management between 2010 and 2013, including direct communications with Gulf Coast’s attorneys.” Grassley concluded, “That one meeting with Mr. McAuliffe was clearly not the extent of your interaction on that matter.”
The EB-5 foreign national investor program has come under intense scrutiny over the past several years. Under the program, enacted into law in 1990, foreign nationals may obtain temporary and permanent green card resident visas in return for investing a minimum of $500,000 in an American company.
The possibility that foreign nationals who have invested in GreenTech Automotive have been granted temporary green card visas due to the political influence of the principals involved is a key issue currently under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General’s Office. 
Terry McAuliffe, who was chairman of GreenTech Automotive during the period when political influence may have played a role in the granting of visas, is a friend and chief fundraiser for former President Bill Clinton. Anthony Rodham, brother of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is the President and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management, which the Department of Homeland Security designated the EB-5 Regional Center that works exclusively with GreenTech Automotive to help secure green card visas for its EB-5 investors.
Grassley’s letter to Mayorkas was one of two stories about GreenTech Automotive that made headlines on Friday. In a related story, GreenTech Automotive confirmed to Breitbart News on Friday that it has received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce company documents. According to the Washington Post, those documents were subpoenaed as evidence in the SEC’s investigation into claims made by GreenTech Automotive to its investors."

It has to be a beautiful thing being an approved member of the left-wing mainstream media. No matter how boring and unimaginative you are, no matter how many facts you get wrong — all your cronies are always right there to back you up.
Jonathan Alter is a tiresome, washed-up leftist whose latest book — the title of which I forget — isn’t selling so well and didn’t do so well in the facts department. In other words, it has been an embarrassment of Joe McGinniss
 proportions. And yet, over the past couple of weeks, Alter’s media comrades have attempted to come to his rescue to try to pump sales by any means necessary. 
Earlier this week, The Huffington Post and Politico’s Dylan Byers both humiliated themselves with their transparently desperate attempts to help Alter out. And now it appears to be the Washington Post’s turn.
You would think that the sting of humiliation that comes with whiffing on the four biggest stories of the Obama presidency might result in something of a wake-up call for the financially troubled Post. But, as if to prove you can’t teach an old Palace Guard new tricks, yesterday the Post poured its bandwidth and investigative resources into… The Tale of the Fox News Supply Closet.
You see, in order to sell his book — other than groveling like a punk
 — Alter salted his love letter to Obama with the kinds of tidbits he knew his fellow Obama-worshipping, Fox News-hating media pals would love: a bunch of nonsense about how Roger Ailes — one of the most successful network executives in history — is some kind of paranoid freak — you know, like Ted Turner. 
Among a litany of over a dozen falsehoods about Ailes, Alter claimed that the Fox News chief is so paranoid about wiretaps (doesn’t sound so paranoid today!) that he “once worked out of a supply closet.” Ailes outright denied the claim to Politico, saying, “It’s completely false and silly. In fact, I had no idea we have a supply closet.”
Well, that obviously set off alarm bells at the same astute Washington Post that missed the IRS, AP, Verizon, and Benghazi scandals. And the result Friday was an in-depth, source-driven, 500-word investigative report into whether or not there are supply closets within the Fox News HQ.
No, I am not kidding.  
And while it is fun to laugh this stuff off, you have to look at the The Matrix of what is really going on — which is pure character assassination. 
Unlike the shriveling Post, Roger Ailes and Fox News are not only wildly succeeding in a media environment where almost everyone else is faltering, but they have been acting like real journalists in the fine tradition of what we saw from the Post during Watergate.
Unlike the Post, Fox News is not whiffing at these scandals or guarding The State’s palace. Instead, they are digging, asking tough questions, pressing for answers, breaking news, and letting Power know that there is at least one real watchdog among the many lapdogs.
But all Fox News and Ailes get in return is to find themselves being investigated and held accountable by a mainstream media — that not only refuse to do the same to the current administration, but are trying to prevent that from happening to the administration.

The curious case of former IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman’s 157 meetings at the White House is now more curious with the revelation that he attended meetings with Stephanie Cutter, Deputy Campaign Manager for President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. While she technically served a stint as a White House advisor to the President, her role has always been that of an aggressive political operator. That their meetings coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative and Tea Party organizations raises many questions. 
Cutter may have had an official White House title, but she has always been a campaign operative. In 2010, she was named an Assistant to the President, charged with communications and outreach for ObamaCare. Presumably, it is in this role that she was in meetings with Shulman. This itself is odd, because as the IRS is tasked with implementing large swathes of ObamaCare, HHS is responsible for the public outreach and oversight of the public exchanges at the heart of the law. 
Cutter has not revealed the details of the meetings she attended with Shulman. We don’t know the exact dates they met, except that they must have coincided with the IRS targeting of conservative groups. We do know that the targeting began around the time that ObamaCare was enacted.
It is hard to imagine a meeting agenda that would include both the supposedly non-partisan IRS Commissioner Shulman and the hyper-partisan Cutter. The IRS is supposed to develop technocratic rules to implement ObamaCare. Communications and outreach ought not be part of their mission. Could it be that part of the White House’s outreach plan on ObamaCare was to silence opponents?
Cutter should be called to testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee to explain the details of these meetings. Her portfolio at the time, communications and outreach, imply a political component that would not ordinarily be tasked to the IRS Commissioner. What, exactly, were the nature of these meetings?

Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberly Strassel noted on Friday that Barack Obama and the IRS have a new plan to target Tea Party groups in advance of the 2014 elections. 
During Thanksgiving week, the Treasury Department announced a proposal to limit the political activity of 501(c)(4) groups. The Obama Administration claimed that the plan was necessary to clarify confusing tax laws. 
The House Ways and Means Committee investigators believe that the proposal was designed by examining Tea Party group applications, figuring out exactly how they proceeded, then limiting those very actions in the new proposal, thus shutting them out of the political process.
House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp said, “The committee has reviewed thousands of tax exempt applications. The new regulation so closely mirrors the abused tea-party group applications, it leads me to question if this new proposed regulation is simply another form of targeting.”
Tea Party groups, just as other tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations, have to prove that the majority of their work is for “primary” social-welfare purpose if they want to keep their tax-exempt status. The primary purpose of most Tea party groups is illuminating for Americans the size of government and the erosion of the Constitution. They do so through nonpartisan voter guides, speakers forums, pamphlets, or voter-registration drives.
Now, however, the IRS is planning to recognize those very activities as “political activity,” not “social welfare,” thus rendering Tea Party groups unfit for 501(c)(4) status. 
Thus, the new proposal is not about clarifying tax laws but rather, as Dave Camp stated, “to put Tea Party groups out of business.”
The new rule only applies to 501(c)(4) groups. The League of Women Voters Education Fund, a Democratic stronghold, is registered as a 501(c)(3), considered a “charity” that is strictly limited regarding its political activity. That same organization claims on its website that it holds “candidate debates and forums,” and its “educational activities” include “understanding candidate views and ballot initiatives.”
The League can still issue its voter guides, registrations, and candidate forums. Any conservative social-welfare organization acting similarly will probably lose its tax-exempt status. And guess which groups are unaffected by the new rule, because they are 501(c)(5)s? 
As Strassel writes:
The same president who in May was “outraged” by the IRS’s actions now says it was all just some confusion over tax law (which his new rule fixes). He told Chris Matthews last week that the media had hyped what was a few poor IRS souls in Cincinnati who were “trying to streamline what is a difficult law to interpret… And they’ve got a list, and suddenly everybody’s outraged.”"

Racist climate denier Rep Pete Sessions is the (most recent) scumbag who disrespected President Obama, per Huffington Post. Perhaps the White House is denying this in an attempt to take the high road.  They probably should have said they had no comment though....
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) let his Democratic caucus know last week in a private meeting that a top House Republican told President Barack Obama, ""I cannot even stand to look at you,"" according to two Democratic senators who were present, and confirmed by two Senate Democratic aides who said they independently learned of the exchange from two other senators.
The alleged incident took place in the throes of the government shutdown, when Obama was meeting with different factions of lawmakers to try to find a resolution to the debacle. The White House aide told Democratic leaders that the lawmaker who couldn't stand to look at the president was Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), the chairman of the House Rules Committee, the two senators told HuffPost.
One of the two Democratic senators who spoke to HuffPost said that Reid told the caucus about the incident last Tuesday and named Sessions.

Despite the efforts of House members like Rep Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) to kill the Monsanto Protection Rider, it passed in the House version of the short-term appropriations bill, the Continuing Resolution (CR).
Today the Senate was successful in stripping this provision out of the CR.
According to Sen Brian Schatz (D-HI)
""The Monsanto Protection Act is bad policy for the country and the State of Hawai‘i. The Senate version of the Continuing Resolution does not include this provision, effectively repealing the Monsanto Protection Act. This provision took the ability of the Secretary of Agriculture to fully exercise his regulatory power over GMOs, and compromised the role of our courts as a check on the legislative and executive systems, making it significantly more difficult for concerned citizens to present their case.
I strongly urge the House not to sneak the Monsanto Protection Act back into the final version of the appropriations bill. However, if it is slipped back in, rather than letting the issue be deliberated with full transparency and public input, I will immediately introduce legislation to repeal it.""

Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), a farmer himself said:
Stripping the Monsanto Protection Act is a victory for American consumers and family farm agriculture.  Corporate giveaways have no business in a bill to fund the government, and I’m pleased that the Senate stood up for accountability and transparency and against special interests.  I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Schatz to make sure that this damaging provision never again makes it into law.""
Hawai'i has been called ""ground zero"" for GMO/Agricultural Chemicals development. Its mild climate allows two growing seasons and its small legislature is easily bought out. In fact only 10 members of the Hawai'i legislature are not recipients of GMO/Chem money.

The GMO seed companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, Bayer, and Dupont are the biggest agricultural chemical manufacturers. Their controversial claims of GMO seeds cutting down on pesticides are exactly opposite of reality. According to Organic Consumers herbicides account for about one-third of the global pesticide market, and around 80% of GM seeds involve herbicide-resistance.
Agriculture chemicals have poisoned aquifers on Oahu and Maui.
Kaua'i now has a bill pending that would require companies like Syngenta to disclose what pesticides they are spraying. Kaua'i residents are concerned not only with existing EPA registered pesticides but the experiments with the unregistered pesticides these GMO companies are developing.
So it is no surprise that popular and progressive Sen Brian Schatz responded to his many constituent calls and helped kill the Monsanto Protection Rider.
However.
Sen Schatz is being primaried by a New Democrat Coalition corporatist, Colleen Hanabusa.  She has been conspicuously quiet on the subject of the Monsanto Rider.
No wonder. Her group, the New Dems, sees biotech as the ""future of the U.S.""  They successfully pushed to extend patents and give corporate welfare to biotech companies.
""New Democrats believe the federal government can promote advances in biotechnology by providing funding for basic research, ensuring the protection of intellectual property and investing in regulatory agencies such as the Patent and Trademark Office and the Federal Drug Administration. ""
Hanabusa is quoted in the latest New Dem press release urging Congress to put partisanship aside.  But according to the New Dems, that means embracing the odious Simpson-Bowles recommendations that balance the budget on the backs of the poor and elderly by cutting Social Security and other safety nets.
Not one word about the New Dems' support of corporate welfare and eternal war.
Sen. Schatz kept his constituents updated on the Monsanto Rider and his (successful) efforts to remove it as well as the nonsensical provision to defund the Affordable Care Act.  We heard about defunding the ACA many times from Hanabusa (always in conjunction with increasingly desperate pleas for donations) but not one word on the Monsanto Rider.
So Rep Hanabusa:  Where do you stand on special deals for biotech companies? With your New Dem pals or with the people of Hawai'i?


12:55 PM PT: Here is the text and a link to legal analysis of the Monsanto Protection Rider:
In the event that a determination of non-regulated status made pursuant to section 411 of the Plant Protection Act is or has been invalidated or vacated, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon request by a farmer, grower, farm operator, or producer, immediately grant temporary permit(s) or temporary deregulation in part, subject to necessary and appropriate conditions consistent with section 411(a) or 412(c) of the Plant Protection Act, which interim conditions shall authorize the movement, introduction, continued cultivation, commercialization and other specifically enumerated activities and requirements, including measures designed to mitigate or minimize potential adverse environmental effects, if any, relevant to the Secretary’s evaluation of the petition for non-regulated status, while ensuring that growers or other users are able to move, plant, cultivate, introduce into commerce and carry out other authorized activities in a timely manner: Provided, That all such conditions shall be applicable only for the interim period necessary for the Secretary to complete any required analyses or consultations related to the petition for non-regulated status: Provided further, That nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the Secretary's authority under section 411, 412 and 414 of the Plant Protection Act.

252,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/04/26/New-York-Times-Reveals-Obama-s-Maneuvers-And-Motives-On-Pigford,News,Breitbart,Republican,Pigford: NYT Pegs Obama for Vote-Buying Scheme,"

The New York Times has vindicated the news sense of Andrew Breitbart and years of Breitbart News coverage of the Pigford scandal with a front page, above the fold blockbuster of investigative journalism that adds new details about the fraud in the USDA farmer settlements and the key role that Barack Obama has played in Pigford dating back to his days as a Senator.
Andrew Breitbart worked tirelessly to expose the Pigford fraud scheme only to have the clear evidence of manipulation by politicians and plaintiff lawyers ignored by the mainstream media. The story involved politicians and lawyers hijacking a lawsuit by black farmers against the USDA designed to make up for years of discrimination and turning it into a multi-billion dollar fraud where people claiming to have ‘attempted to farm’ were able to collect $50,000 checks with no proof. The Obama administration expanded the program for Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, using the same low “attempted to farm” standard that invited massive, undetectable fraud.  
The Times piece was written by a team led by Sharon LaFraniere, who worked on the story for months and according to the article “was based on thousands of pages of court and confidential government documents, as well as interviews with dozens of claimants, lawyers, former and current government officials and others involved in the cases over the past 14 years.”
Here are some highlights from the article, including a number of details not previously reported:
Questionable Legal Moves
The Times story gives a great deal of detail about how the Obama administration certified its own settlement in the cases of the Native American, women, and Hispanic farmer settlements, sidestepping both the legal system ad Congress. Breitbart News has reported on the Obama administration’s expansion of Pigford previously, but the Times brought shocking new information to light. 
For one thing, there were only a total of 91 plaintiffs actually filing suit; 10 women and 81 Latinos. This is a very small number and it certainly would have been possible to handle any actual discrimination claims on a case-by-case basis. However, the Times points out that the government was very skeptical even about those cases. 
“Some of these folks have never made a loan payment in their entire history with U.S.D.A.,” Lisa A. Olson, the lead government litigator against the 81 Hispanic plaintiffs, told Judge Robertson in August 2009. “There may even be folks who are under criminal investigation.”
The Obama Administration made a choice to create a settlement mechanism on their own. The Times says “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”
With pressure mounting from some in Congress, “The Obama administration made the ‘legally questionable’ decision to sidestep Congress and pay the woman and Hispanic farmer claims out of a special Treasury Department fund known as The Judgment Fund. “
The small number of actual cases is also significant because of the disparity in the number of actual suits and the number of claims filed so far in the cases; only ten women were actually filing suit but an incredible 24,000 have filed to get $50,000 under the settlement still active at the FarmerClaims.gov website.
Pigford Was About Buying Votes
Even the New York Times has trouble getting Department of Justice officials to speak on record on the story. The Times says, “Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West, who supervised the civil division and oversaw the handling of the cases, canceled an interview. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also declined to comment.”
This 2008 article from the San Francisco Chronicle profiles Tony West, who was then the California finance co-chair for the Obama campaign and is described as an “Obama power broker.” West, a deep Obama campaign insider, oversaw the settlements for the Obama administration.
This is another indication that the Pigford scandal was about vote buying and elections for the politicians involved. Much of the original Pigford corruption traces to Arkansas. That was no accident but was at the behest of the man who was President when the first Pigford settlement was designed, Bill Clinton. From the Times:
Mr. Clinton asked Carol Willis, then a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who was known for his expertise in black voter turnout, to get involved. Mr. Willis said the president wanted to make sure his home state, Arkansas, benefited.
During the 2008 elections, the Times details how the Obama administration used Pigford for election purposes. From the Times:
..legislators from both parties, including Mr. Obama as a senator in 2007, sponsored bills to grant the late filers relief.
Mr. Boyd said Mr. Obama’s support led him to throw the backing of his 109,000-member black farmers’ association behind the Obama presidential primary campaign. Hilary Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.’s chief lobbyist, said Mr. Obama’s stance helped establish him as a defender of the concerns of rural African-American communities.
And the Times makes it clear that others felt the settlements were buying off special interests. A professor from U.C. Berkley testified for the government that there was no pattern of discrimination by the USDA against Native American farmers. 
Professor Rausser was astounded when, with both sides gearing up for trial in late 2009, the government began settlement negotiations. “If they had gone to trial, the government would have prevailed,” he said.
“It was just a joke,” he added. “I was so disgusted. It was simply buying the support of the Native-Americans.”"

Obama had a bad 2013 but Huff Post’s Sam Stein wants to know why. Among the answers he comes up with is the White House’s own arrogance.
Stein reviews a series of reasons why 2013 broke bad for the President. The Obamacare rollout gets top billing and unexpected events in Newtown and Syria also make the list. But at least a few people see the source of the problem as coming not from outside the White House but within it:
Mike Lux, who served as Obama’s liaison to the progressive community
during the 2008 White House transition and has been critical of the
administration since, argued that self-assuredness played a damaging
role, preventing Obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon.
When would-be allies warned the White House about the looming dangers
of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a
Larry Summers Federal Reserve nomination, the advice was heard, but not
necessarily heeded.  
“I feel like the White House goes it alone too much,” said Lux. “In
advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem, it doesn’t
seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion
in the party and with progressive allies.” 
A top progressive operative put it more bluntly: “These guys are
stunningly arrogant. They really believe that their shit doesn’t smell,
that they have all the answers. And that arrogance continues to hurt
them.”
Stein concludes that the hinge point of the bad year was Obamacare. That was the place where false promises and foreseeable problems all rushed together in a sickening crunch for the administration. After the government shutdown in October, the Republicans were polling badly and Obamacare was trending up despite the fact that the site did not work at all. Two months later, with the scope of their failure made clear, all of those gains have been reversed and then some."

The liberal media have their knives out for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) after his textbook cross-examination of Secretary of Defense nominee Chuck Hagel at the latter’s confirmation hearing Jan. 31. Jane Mayer of the New Yorker seized on a speech Cruz gave three years ago in which he asserted that when he was at Harvard Law School, shortly after Barack Obama, there were twelve Marxists on the faculty and one Republican.
That, Mayer alleges, is evidence of Cruz’s innate McCarthyism–and hence, she implies, ought to discredit Cruz’s inquiries into Hagel’s beliefs and financial backing. That’s rich coming from the New Yorker‘s resident Koch-obsessive, who launched a McCarthyist assault on the Tea Party in 2010, asserting it was mere Astroturf for the “billionaire Koch brothers’ war against Obama,” and demanding more scrutiny of the Kochs’ ties to it.
Her current campaign against Cruz is a pure political vendetta–a fact she does not even try to deny. In her latest offering, she defends her sudden interest in the 2010 speech as follows: “…Cruz’s hostile questioning of Obama’s nominee for Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, and insinuations about Hagel’s loyalties had provided a fresh context for looking more closely at the nature of the accusations he has leveled at political opponents.” 
In terms of accusations against one’s opponents, it’s hard to top Mayer’s suggestion that millions of conservative Americans are paid stooges–or Obama’s numerous attacks on opponents using false accusations and innuendo. Remember the doctors who cut out kids’ tonsils for no reason except greed? The Republican presidential nominee who just might be a felon, and may have killed a man’s wife? Few complaints from Mayer there.
In fact, Mayer gave positive coverage to the anti-Bain Capital ads that ran against Romney in Ohio. In a post-election article on Nov. 19, 2012, “Seeing Spots,” Mayer noted that the ad about a worker’s dead wife was inaccurate. She nonetheless celebrated the company that made it for another ad in the series, “Stage,” which helped “to float the image of Romney as a coldhearted fat cat” and gave Obama a decisive advantage in the polls.
Cruz was absolutely correct that there were, and are, many radicals on Harvard Law’s faculty, and few Republicans. Give the Texan a technical for hyperbole: he may have over-counted the Communist revolutionaries, and undercounted the Republicans. But Mayer turns to two dubious sources to attack Cruz’s assertion. One is Charles Fried, the former Reagan solicitor general; the other is critical legal studies guru Duncan Kennedy.
Fried was a Republican. He is far to the left of that party today. In 2008, Fried voted for Barack Obama. In 2011, in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he declared that Obamacare’s individual mandate was constitutional–even agreeing that it would be constitutional for Congress to pass a law forcing people to buy vegetables or buy a gym membership. Though it upheld Obamacare, the Supreme Court rejected that argument. 
As for Kennedy, he is not a Communist, and says he never “believed in the overthrow of the U.S. Government.” Yet he believes in the undoing of much that sustains our system. of laws and institutions. For example, when I was a student, he once told me that the solution to the problem of illegal immigration from Mexico was to end the border entirely, i.e. to be one country. That would have rather radical implications for our government.
One of Kennedy’s colleagues, Roberto Unger, is a fellow member of the critical legal studies movement. He is not a Communist, but a self-described leftist revolutionary nonetheless. I took two classes with Unger while I was an undergraduate, and he attacked the American “cult of the Constitution,” arguing that the world’s present countries with a new system in which each represented a different (leftist) “moral” vision.
Several members of Harvard Law’s faculty espouse other radical left ideas. They are not card-carrying Communists, but some do see themselves as proponents of different forms of Marxist thought, and would like to see revolutionary changes in both the U.S. government and the international order. Saul Alinsky, too, was not a Communist–but he believed in the radical disruption of our political system and the redistribution of wealth.
Those views are distinguishable from formal Communism only by virtue of the fact that they do not call for a proletarian dictatorship. Our contemporary “social democrats” wish to impose such revolutionary changes through our present political system, transforming our Constitution and our society through democratic means. There are far more of such radical professors at Harvard Law School than those who defend conservative thought.
The media’s crusade against Cruz proves that in Obama’s America, it is considered far worse to accuse someone of being a Marxist than to be one. The same journalists who demand full disclosure of every penny that conservative financiers might have put into lobbying or politics now mock Cruz’s attempt to probe Hagel’s financial disclosures–or the lack thereof, since Hagel has refused to supply much of the requested information.
It is certainly of interest that a man who would lead the Pentagon would have close ties to an organization funded by the Saudi government, the Hariri family, and foreign arms dealers, among others. Had Hagel been chairman of Americans for Prosperity, Mayer would no doubt be clamoring for a full-scale investigation into the Kochs. Instead, she is leading a smear campaign against Cruz, one of the few in D.C. actually doing his job."

Sally Quinn, bad for women everywhere.

Today's flaming dish of burning stupid—actually published two days ago but just hitting my radar today—Sally Quinn writes about Huma Abedin:
Though her friends say she is strong and resolute and defiant, sadly she makes all women look like weak and helpless victims. She was not standing there in a position of strength. It was such a setback for women everywhere.
Really, Sally? Really? One woman's private decision about her personal relationship with her erring husband is a setback for women everywhere?
Horseshit. Just stunning, mind-boggling horseshit.
What any woman decides to do inside the complexity of her own marital relationship has absolutely no bearing on any one woman anywhere. Much less is a ""setback"" for us all.
Or as one commenter at the foot of the column put it to Quinn:
This from a woman who began an affair with her married boss, broke up his marriage, and proceeded to re-make hershelf as some perfect Christian woman. Really? Maybe we should let Ms. Abedin deal with her marriage with some privacy.

Eight months into President George W. Bush’s second term, the Washington Post wrote that Bush’s frequent trips to his Texas ranch symbolized “a lackadaisical approach to the world’s most important day job” and gleefully noted that Bush was intent on setting the record for being on “vacation”–or away from Washington, D.C.–for the most number of days of any president. 
But when President Barack Obama vacations in Hawaii, sets up a fantasy golf vacation for himself with Butch Harmon and Tiger Woods, averages more than a vacation a month in 2013 while purporting to be a man of the people and demanding the rich pay their fair share, and playing sequester politics by shutting down White House tours, the mainstream media is silent. 
And while Bush spent more time outside of Washington than Obama, it is also worth nothing that nearly all of Bush’s vacations were trips back to his Texas ranch or family vacation homes in Maine. 
The Post, in 2005, conceded that Bush’s vacations–unlike Obama’s–were not lavish and he did not “make time for fun.”
“Bush rarely takes the type of vacation one would consider exotic — or, to some, even appealing,” the Post wrote. “His notion of relaxation is chopping cedar on his ranch or mountain biking through rough terrain, all in 100-degree-plus temperatures in dusty Texas where crickets are known to roast on the summer pavement. He seems to relish the idea of exposing aides and reporters to the hothouse environment.”
Obama, on the other hand, has traveled to Hawaii every winter. The Obama daughters are vacationing at the Atlantis Resort in the Bahamas this week with a full Secret Service detail, as Breitbart News reported, even as the White House claimed they could not afford to pay Secret Service agents to continue the popular White House tours for other students who are on their spring vacations in Washington, D.C. 
The Obamas have gone to Martha’s Vineyard multiple times while the country was in recession and Americans were struggling to find jobs. Michelle Obama has taken a whirlwind trip to Spain and a ski trip to Aspen. 
Obama took 13 vacations in his first term, which spanned all or part of 83 days. But they have been much more lavish than Bush’s. His annual vacations to Hawaii alone have cost taxpayers at least $20 million during his first term. In 2011 alone, Michelle Obama may have cost taxpayers $10 million on vacations herself. Obama’s fantasy golf outing this year cost local law enforcement in Florida a reported $78, 205. 
Bush was content to work from home during his vacations. And for doing so, the mainstream media tagged him as lazy and disinterested.

It has to be a beautiful thing being an approved member of the left-wing mainstream media. No matter how boring and unimaginative you are, no matter how many facts you get wrong — all your cronies are always right there to back you up.
Jonathan Alter is a tiresome, washed-up leftist whose latest book — the title of which I forget — isn’t selling so well and didn’t do so well in the facts department. In other words, it has been an embarrassment of Joe McGinniss
 proportions. And yet, over the past couple of weeks, Alter’s media comrades have attempted to come to his rescue to try to pump sales by any means necessary. 
Earlier this week, The Huffington Post and Politico’s Dylan Byers both humiliated themselves with their transparently desperate attempts to help Alter out. And now it appears to be the Washington Post’s turn.
You would think that the sting of humiliation that comes with whiffing on the four biggest stories of the Obama presidency might result in something of a wake-up call for the financially troubled Post. But, as if to prove you can’t teach an old Palace Guard new tricks, yesterday the Post poured its bandwidth and investigative resources into… The Tale of the Fox News Supply Closet.
You see, in order to sell his book — other than groveling like a punk
 — Alter salted his love letter to Obama with the kinds of tidbits he knew his fellow Obama-worshipping, Fox News-hating media pals would love: a bunch of nonsense about how Roger Ailes — one of the most successful network executives in history — is some kind of paranoid freak — you know, like Ted Turner. 
Among a litany of over a dozen falsehoods about Ailes, Alter claimed that the Fox News chief is so paranoid about wiretaps (doesn’t sound so paranoid today!) that he “once worked out of a supply closet.” Ailes outright denied the claim to Politico, saying, “It’s completely false and silly. In fact, I had no idea we have a supply closet.”
Well, that obviously set off alarm bells at the same astute Washington Post that missed the IRS, AP, Verizon, and Benghazi scandals. And the result Friday was an in-depth, source-driven, 500-word investigative report into whether or not there are supply closets within the Fox News HQ.
No, I am not kidding.  
And while it is fun to laugh this stuff off, you have to look at the The Matrix of what is really going on — which is pure character assassination. 
Unlike the shriveling Post, Roger Ailes and Fox News are not only wildly succeeding in a media environment where almost everyone else is faltering, but they have been acting like real journalists in the fine tradition of what we saw from the Post during Watergate.
Unlike the Post, Fox News is not whiffing at these scandals or guarding The State’s palace. Instead, they are digging, asking tough questions, pressing for answers, breaking news, and letting Power know that there is at least one real watchdog among the many lapdogs.
But all Fox News and Ailes get in return is to find themselves being investigated and held accountable by a mainstream media — that not only refuse to do the same to the current administration, but are trying to prevent that from happening to the administration.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez has denied soliciting prostitutes in the Dominican Republic but admitted he traveled at least three times on a donor’s private plane to and from the country. 
The statement comes on the heels of an FBI raid on wealthy ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen’s Miami office late Tuesday evening and internal FBI emails showing the bureau is investigating the Senator’s alleged solicitation of allegedly underage prostitutes in the Dominican.

“Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Senator Menendez for many years,” Menendez’s office said in a Wednesday statement, according to the Washington Post. “Senator Menendez has traveled on Dr. Melgen’s plane on three occasions, all of which have been paid for and reported appropriately. Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false.”
When the story first broke, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) executive director Rob Jesmer called on Menendez to release all his travel records. He has not done that, and his spokeswoman Tricia Enright did not immediately respond to a Breitbart News request for the travel records. 
Jesmer said the allegations against Menendez are “very serious and deserve examination.”
“Fortunately, there is a simple way for Senator Menendez to begin addressing these questions, and that is by releasing his schedule and travel records related to Easter Week of this year, as well as the other dates in question,” Jesmer said.
This reporter broke the story while writing for The Daily Caller last year and interviewed two Dominican Republic women in November who claimed Menendez paid them for sex around Easter-time last year. The encounter apparently took place at Casa de Campo, a posh 7,000-acre resort in the Dominican Republic. Each woman told this reporter that Menendez had agreed to pay them $500 for sex but only paid them $100."

The New York Times has vindicated the news sense of Andrew Breitbart and years of Breitbart News coverage of the Pigford scandal with a front page, above the fold blockbuster of investigative journalism that adds new details about the fraud in the USDA farmer settlements and the key role that Barack Obama has played in Pigford dating back to his days as a Senator.
Andrew Breitbart worked tirelessly to expose the Pigford fraud scheme only to have the clear evidence of manipulation by politicians and plaintiff lawyers ignored by the mainstream media. The story involved politicians and lawyers hijacking a lawsuit by black farmers against the USDA designed to make up for years of discrimination and turning it into a multi-billion dollar fraud where people claiming to have ‘attempted to farm’ were able to collect $50,000 checks with no proof. The Obama administration expanded the program for Native Americans, Hispanics, and women, using the same low “attempted to farm” standard that invited massive, undetectable fraud.  
The Times piece was written by a team led by Sharon LaFraniere, who worked on the story for months and according to the article “was based on thousands of pages of court and confidential government documents, as well as interviews with dozens of claimants, lawyers, former and current government officials and others involved in the cases over the past 14 years.”
Here are some highlights from the article, including a number of details not previously reported:
Questionable Legal Moves
The Times story gives a great deal of detail about how the Obama administration certified its own settlement in the cases of the Native American, women, and Hispanic farmer settlements, sidestepping both the legal system ad Congress. Breitbart News has reported on the Obama administration’s expansion of Pigford previously, but the Times brought shocking new information to light. 
For one thing, there were only a total of 91 plaintiffs actually filing suit; 10 women and 81 Latinos. This is a very small number and it certainly would have been possible to handle any actual discrimination claims on a case-by-case basis. However, the Times points out that the government was very skeptical even about those cases. 
“Some of these folks have never made a loan payment in their entire history with U.S.D.A.,” Lisa A. Olson, the lead government litigator against the 81 Hispanic plaintiffs, told Judge Robertson in August 2009. “There may even be folks who are under criminal investigation.”
The Obama Administration made a choice to create a settlement mechanism on their own. The Times says “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments engineered a stunning turnabout: they committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”
With pressure mounting from some in Congress, “The Obama administration made the ‘legally questionable’ decision to sidestep Congress and pay the woman and Hispanic farmer claims out of a special Treasury Department fund known as The Judgment Fund. “
The small number of actual cases is also significant because of the disparity in the number of actual suits and the number of claims filed so far in the cases; only ten women were actually filing suit but an incredible 24,000 have filed to get $50,000 under the settlement still active at the FarmerClaims.gov website.
Pigford Was About Buying Votes
Even the New York Times has trouble getting Department of Justice officials to speak on record on the story. The Times says, “Acting Associate Attorney General Tony West, who supervised the civil division and oversaw the handling of the cases, canceled an interview. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. also declined to comment.”
This 2008 article from the San Francisco Chronicle profiles Tony West, who was then the California finance co-chair for the Obama campaign and is described as an “Obama power broker.” West, a deep Obama campaign insider, oversaw the settlements for the Obama administration.
This is another indication that the Pigford scandal was about vote buying and elections for the politicians involved. Much of the original Pigford corruption traces to Arkansas. That was no accident but was at the behest of the man who was President when the first Pigford settlement was designed, Bill Clinton. From the Times:
Mr. Clinton asked Carol Willis, then a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee who was known for his expertise in black voter turnout, to get involved. Mr. Willis said the president wanted to make sure his home state, Arkansas, benefited.
During the 2008 elections, the Times details how the Obama administration used Pigford for election purposes. From the Times:
..legislators from both parties, including Mr. Obama as a senator in 2007, sponsored bills to grant the late filers relief.
Mr. Boyd said Mr. Obama’s support led him to throw the backing of his 109,000-member black farmers’ association behind the Obama presidential primary campaign. Hilary Shelton, the N.A.A.C.P.’s chief lobbyist, said Mr. Obama’s stance helped establish him as a defender of the concerns of rural African-American communities.
And the Times makes it clear that others felt the settlements were buying off special interests. A professor from U.C. Berkley testified for the government that there was no pattern of discrimination by the USDA against Native American farmers. 
Professor Rausser was astounded when, with both sides gearing up for trial in late 2009, the government began settlement negotiations. “If they had gone to trial, the government would have prevailed,” he said.
“It was just a joke,” he added. “I was so disgusted. It was simply buying the support of the Native-Americans.”"

With Fox News‘ “declaration of war” on the Obama administration’s anti-journalism policies, the Democrat-Media Complex has been divided against itself. 
Members of the press, who consistently hide behind their own objectivity, have been forced to come out in Fox News’ favor in the Department of Justice targeting of Fox News journalist James Rosen. Democrats have been forced to come out of the woodwork to declare that the Obama administration’s treatment of journalists has indeed been abysmal.
But this is a political set-up that cannot hold. The journalistic establishment is generally all too happy to watch their conservative colleagues burned at the stake. Only the fact that the Associated Press was targeted before James Rosen forces the press to embrace the united front approach against the administration.
So what comes next?
The Obama administration surely will not stop targeting its opponents in the press. Whether they are monitoring James Rosen’s communications, screaming at CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson for daring to cover the Fast and Furious scandal, or giving “advice” to Bob Woodward about covering President Obama, the White House operates through intimidation. For years, the White House has made Fox News its primary target in the anti-media war, recognizing that the rest of the media would play along.
Now Obama and company must win back their traditional media allies. That will start with a coordinated play – likely led by White House ally Media Matters – directed at Fox News. An opinion host will be targeted for destruction, and the White House will jump in with both feet. Other reporters, recognizing the cover provided by the White House targeting an opinion journalist at Fox News rather than a straight reporter, will join in. Soon the alliance between Fox News and their erstwhile friends will be broken completely, even as the mainstream press pretends to back journalistic integrity.
This game is not over. Not by a long shot. The Democrats and their press allies know that turning on Fox News is the only way to prevent the burgeoning Obama scandals from turning their man into an early lame duck. The united front will undoubtedly cave soon.
The question, then, is simple: will the American people hold the members of the Democrat-Media Complex accountable for abandoning their journalistic mission in favor of Obama administration shilling?

The smackdown video above was released Wednesday by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Message: What IRS scandal? Not that the failure of Republicans, particularly Rep. Darrell Issa of California and the puppets in the right-wing media noise machine, will ever shut up about this no matter what is learned about the reality.
We've had months of ""investigations"" and allegations that there was a partisan effort by the IRS, coordinated by the White House, to target tea party organizations over their tax-exempt status. What have we learned? Democratic and independent groups were looked at in the IRS examination of tax status, not just tea party groups. None of the tea party groups were denied tax-exempt status. While bellyaching about the supposed partisan nature of the IRS's evaluation of these groups, Issa asked IRS Inspector General J. Russell George to confine himself to looking solely at conservative and tea party groups in his internal investigation into what happened.
As for Issa's claims that he would tie the ""scandal"" to the White House? Bupkis.
At a breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer had sharp words for the ""investigation"":
""The allegation was, by many Republicans, that the White House was directing the IRS to target Tea Party groups,"" he said. ""That was the allegation. And that has turned out to be completely false. There is no evidence to suggest that. And now it has turned out that the IRS was not just targeting conservative groups but also looking at a large number of progressive groups as well. So that changes the dynamic of what it was.""
Issa warned us in November 2010, gloated actually, just before he became head of the House Oversight committee, that he would be overseeing seven investigatory hearings a week, 40 weeks a year. Many of those since then have been overblown, partisan affairs at best and cheap-shot smear jobs of President Obama at worst. All of it designed to capture the limelight.
Government should be held accountable. Scandals should be exposed. Reforms should be instituted where problems are uncovered. But using government authority and wasting taxpayer resources to launch baseless attacks for partisan gain and public attention are themselves deserving of some official probing. Perhaps Congressman Issa could focus that Klieg light he loves to wield in another direction—on himself.

Well, if it is Thursday, there must be a new Obama scandal. But one thing is for damn sure: whatever that scandal is, you can bet the American mainstream media will be playing catch up and not having the glory of breaking a story about a major White House scandal. 
Fact: Over the past few weeks, four major scandals have broken over the Obama administration, and it is a very sad (and frightening) truth that our pathetic, American, lapdog mainstream media are not responsible for breaking even a single one. 
Verizon? Nope, not our guys. That was the Brits over at The Guardian.  
IRS? Nope, not our guys. The IRS broke their own scandal with a planted question. 
The Justice Department’s seizure of Associated Press phone records? Nope, not our guys. Believe it or not, the Associated Press didn’t even break that story. Like the IRS, we only found out because the Justice Department outted itself in a letter notifying the AP of what it had done. 
Benghazi? Are you kidding. With a couple of rare exceptions (Jake Tapper, Sharyl Attkisson) the media have spent the last eight months attacking those seeking the truth (Congress, Fox News)–not seeking the truth. It was the GOP congress that demanded the email exchanges concerning the shaping of the talking points, not the media. 
Left up to the media, we wouldn’t know anything about Libya. All of the media’s energy was collectively poured into ensuring the truth was never discovered. 
And do you want to know what makes this realization especially pathetic? In three of the four scandals (the AP being the exception), had our media been less interested in protecting Power and more interested in holding Power accountable, these huge, career-making stories were right there for the taking. 
For over a year now, conservative Tea Party groups have been complaining about IRS harassment. But because Obama told them to, the media hate the Tea Party. So in the face of these complaints and even a few Congressional inquiries, the media either ignored the harassment reports or openly sided with the IRS. (No joke. Click the link.)
Obviously, you can say the same about Libya. All the dots were there to connect: Security failures, two weeks of lies, the midnight arrest of some hapless filmmaker… But rather than connect the dots, the media played goalie for Obama against Fox News and Darrell Issa. Besides, there was a re-election to win and Todd Akin got something wrong about The Womanparts. 
Moreover, there are still plenty of dots to connect about Libya. But the new SQUIRREL is OVERREACH, and already the lapdogs are back in goalie formation. 
As for the Verizon story, members of Congress, specifically Democrat Senators Ron Wyden (OR) and Mark Udall (CO), have been hint-hint-wink-winking to the media that something is horribly amiss going back to December:
In a Senate floor speech in December, Wyden hinted at classified information he had received but could not share due to Senate rules that indicated the law “on Americans’ privacy has been real, and it is not hypothetical.”
“When the public finds out that these secret interpretations are so dramatically different than what the public law says, I think there’s going to be extraordinary anger in the country,” he told The Huffington Post the following month.
That is from today’s Politico report on the Verizon scandal. Apparently, Politico knew of this back in December but had all their investigative researchers digging into why those short-skirted Tea Partiers had it coming, so they missed another one of the biggest stories of the year. 
Politico shouldn’t feel bad, though, because when it comes to missing the four biggest scoops of the Obama administration, they have plenty of lazy, lapdog, sycophant company in that department. 
Our media are not only biased; it is an utter and complete failure and embarrassment. And although there are plenty of remaining table scraps to make meals out of, the media are already losing interest in the IRS, Libya, and AP scandals, but for only one reason–they are absolutely terrified of where they might lead. 
During the Bush years, it was the New York Times, Washington Post and Sy Hersh breaking story  after story after story about the White House. And yes, some of that reporting was–ahem –overreach, but at least Power knew it was being watched; our democracy was safe because an overzealous media  is what you call a luxury problem. 
Today, it is the complete opposite, and the result is an administration run amok. 
Get down on your knees and thank your Maker for conservative New Media, Roger Ailes, and for the few true liberals left in the media, like Glenn Greenwald–who works for the Brits.

A new Fox News poll shows Obama’s disapproval rating among registered voters has spiked to 51%, up from 45% last month. The poll shows an 8-point swing against Obama since April. Another shocking finding, undoubtedly linked to recent scandals, is that 68% of voters think the federal government is “out of control.”
Last month, 47% of voters approved of the job Obama was doing, while 45% disapproved. Disapproval of Obama has jumped 6 points since the latest scandal revelations. Among Independents, only 40% approve of Obama, while 52% disapprove. At this time 4 years ago, 60% of voters approved of Obama and only 30% disapproved. 
The scandals are also taking a toll on voters expectations for Obama’s second term. A plurality 49% believe his is a lame-duck, while 47% think he still has the ability to accomplish things in his final years in office. For the first time ever, also, less than a majority see Obama has “honest and trustworthy.” 
The poll also contained troubling news for embattled Attorney General Eric Holder. Just 28% of voters approve of Holder’s job performance, while 40% disapprove. It is surprising that almost 70% of voters even have an opinion of an Attorney General’s job performance. 
The particular nature of the current scandals, featuring cover-ups and abuses of power, are having a dramatic effect on how voters see the federal government. 68% believe the government is “out of control” and acting in a way that threatens civil liberties. Only 26% of voters report they don’t feel this way. Even a plurality of Democrats, 47-45, say the government is “out of control.”
These are no ordinary scandals and their consequences for Obama and the Democrats are only beginning to be felt.
The poll of 1,013 voters was conducted Saturday through Monday by Republican and Democrat polling firms. "

On Tuesday, Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer appeared on Fox & Friends and revealed that former Vice President Al Gore and other Obama cronies are cashing in on the Obamacare debacle.
In 2004, David Blood and former Vice President Al Gore co-founded Generation Investment Management. Schweizer says despite the perception that Gore’s investments are all green energy-related, Blood and Gore’s investment portfolio is currently comprised of 27% health care investments and stands poised to score big from Obamacare. 
“David Blood was a bundler for Barack Obama,” said Schweizer. “Even though they talk about being in green technology, 27% of their investment portfolio right now is in health insurance companies designed to profit from this sector.” 
Blood bundled over $500,000 in campaign donations for Obama in 2012.

Schweizer, whose new book Extortion debuted at number eight on the New York Times bestseller list, said other Obama fundraisers are also cashing in on the government health care overhaul. 
“The same thing goes for the private equity firms,” said Schweizer. “Evercore Partners–who is headed by Roger Altman, a bundler for the Obama campaign–they are said to cash in on what everybody is saying is going to be massive mergers between hospital companies, etc. Wall Street firms need to broker those deals and a company like Evercore Partners is perfectly positioned to do that.” 
Even as 4.9 million Americans are losing their health insurance plans under Obamacare, Schweizer says top Obama campaign fundraisers and insiders stand to rake in millions.  
“It’s a great business for them because the law basically creates a market for products that didn’t exist before,” said Schweizer. 
“Your book, Extortion, is going to open a lot of eyes,” said Fox & Friends co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck."

You expect to hear bottom-feeding lunacy from American Family Radio.  But this morning, Sandy Rios did something that hit way below the belt even by AFR standards.  On her daily morning show, Rios claimed that Hillary Clinton is lying about her recent health problems, including the blood clot found on her brain.  As if that wasn't bad enough, she claimed the whole story was a plot straight out of Saul Alinsky's playbook.  People for the American Way got a clip.
She’s out of the hospital, so they say, but did anybody see that yesterday? They saw pictures of her riding in the car, a camera caught her, she looked perfectly happy, laughing. Leaving the hospital but there had been no report that she had left the hospital and then suddenly the State Department issues a statement, ‘oh yes she’s out of the hospital.’ This has been a bizarre story to me. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t one of the skeptics, I am a skeptic, I’m a huge skeptic. Let me just give you the exaggerated claims here. The National Enquirer printed a story saying that Hillary Clinton is having a ‘brain cancer drama.’ And then of course we’ve had detailed reports of this blood clot that supposedly happened as a result of a fall which supposedly happened as a result of a terrible flu which that had caught.
I read an article in the Washington Post just a couple of days ago where her two doctors, and I’m sorry I can do this because I’m a girl, they are both women and they have these very strong female names and I say to myself: you know what, I just, I’m sorry, I just—do you know that the doctors have refused to make statements? They have not been allowed to ask questions, it’s just been statements from the State Department reporting how dreadfully awful, terrible the disease, that Hillary Clinton has is.
I think the point I want to make is that Hillary Clinton has a long history. Many of us remember what a liar she is. She sat at the feet of Saul Alinsky, she wrote her master’s thesis on how to do propaganda and lie; I see her finger prints on Benghazi, I see her finger prints on this illness. I have to say this is like the ‘Boy that Cried Wolf,’ when you lie that many times in your life, when you won’t testify in all of these scandals with your family, when you destroy women that your husband’s been involved in by lying about them, when you create this vast right-wing conspiracy, then who can believe you when you say you’re sick? I’m sorry, I’m not there.

Listen to the whole show here.  
Sick.  Absolutely sick.  Even for a network that actively promoted the smear that Christopher Stevens brought his beating on himself because he was supposedly an openly gay ambassador in a Muslim country, this is just disgusting.  Can you imagine what would happen if someone from our side suggested a prominent conservative was faking an injury?  
Tell Rios what you think of her idiocy on her Facebook.

Eric Holder knows that the only way he can save his job is by currying favor with the media, which is exactly what the embattled Attorney General is doing. The question is, will the media once again cave to the wishes of their beloved Obama administration or do their jobs and demand a full accounting from an out-of-control Justice Department on a chilling rampage to intimidate journalists and their sources? 
Yesterday, the Daily Beast embarrassed itself with a Holder profile so glowing and so obviously aimed at tamping down the media’s frustration with him, that even BuzzFeed’s left-wing Ben Smith raised his eyebrows over it on “Morning Joe” Wednesday. 
We also learned Wednesday that Holder has already set up meetings with various representatives from a number of print and television organizations to discuss how the DOJ will handle leak investigations in the future. 
During his Congressional testimony two weeks ago, Holder didn’t seem at all contrite during questioning about his department’s role in the seizure of phone records from the Associated Press. In fact, the Attorney General came off as cocky, bored, and peevish. 
Holder also didn’t even seem terribly fazed after it was discovered that he was the one who signed an application for a warrant to seize the private emails and phone records of Fox News reporter James Rosen. 
What has come out since, though, has obviously knocked the smug out of him. The House Judiciary Committee is now investigating Holder’s statements during his recent testimony. It seems that Holder’s statement about never hearing or having anything to do with attempting to prosecute a journalist or reporter doesn’t quite reconcile with an application that accused Rosen of espionage. A perjury charge could be forthcoming. 
What has to worry Holder the most, though, is that the revelations surrounding the Justice Department’s hysterical actions toward Fox News have not elicited the kind of reaction from the mainstream media that Holder likely expected. The media hates Fox News almost as much as the Obama administration does, but only almost. 
Rather than let their political hatred and envy of Fox News’s success turn into a Get Out of Jail Free card for Holder, the media has instead rallied around Fox. This means that once Congress is back in session next and the hearings into the Justice Department begin, the press coverage could be very bad for an Attorney General who up till now has been zealously protected by the media in scandal after scandal. 
The Huffington Post has already called for Holder to be fired. If the rest of the mainstream media jumps on board, Holder is toast and Holder knows this. More importantly, so does Obama. In short, Holder’s fate and legacy will be decided by how the media collective chooses to cover this scandal in the coming weeks. 
So starting as early as Thursday, Holder is going to attempt to charm and convince the media to ignore their duty, circle the wagons, and play goalie for him just one more time.

After weeks of being vilified by the national media and White House as a terrorist, racist, and radical hostage-taker out to destroy the economy, Ted Cruz (R-TX) is receiving the kind of death threats that are all-too expected after this kind of national demonization campaign. A person who identifies himself on Twitter as Troy Gilmore, Jr. listed the Senator’s homes address and suggested Cruz be taught a “street wise lesson.” Capitol Police are investigating:
 The Hill reported Capitol Police were looking into the post by someone identifying himself as Troy  Gilmore Jr.
 The tweet, posted early Friday, said, “Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home  address in Houston, The Hill reported.
 It also said, “What goes around comes around CRUZ!!”
 The Hill said the poster — using the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 — said he had served in the U.S.  Army and Navy, and posted another tweet Friday afternoon saying Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a  street wise [sic] lesson.”
In the last couple of weeks, the hate speech directed at Cruz from the elite media has been merciless. Politico mused about drowning Cruz; The Washington Post compared Cruz to an evil, mass-murdering terrorist – “Ted Bin Laden”; a writer for The New Yorker compared Cruz to O.J. Simpson. The media have also made Cruz the face of a movement they have described as a bunch of racists “wearing suicide vests” and “taking hostages.” 
Mind you, this is just what the elite media have been saying. President Obama and top Democrats have been just as bad. 
After all of this, the only surprise is that this is the only death threat against Cruz, or at least the only one we know of. Why would someone not feel a seething hostility towards an individual the national media and our president are wishing dead, comparing to terrorists, and relentlessly demonizing as the leader of a radical, dangerous, arsonist, anarchist, racist, hostage-taking cause that will destroy America?
We sure have come a long way from a media and White House that just two years ago made a national crusade out of finding a New Tone in politics. In the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, within an hour, the media blamed Governor Sarah Palin over a standard issue campaign map that placed crosshairs over Giffords’ district. Even after it was clear there was no connection to the map and the deranged killer, the media and President Obama still lectured America over the corrosive effect violent political rhetoric was having on our culture. 
But just two years later, the media are no longer interested in enforcing the New Tone. And just a year after trying to destroy Rush Limbaugh over his labeling of a left-wing activist as a “slut,” the media are currently engaged in a hate speech campaign beyond anything we have seen in years.  
Politics aside, although the media will never publicly acknowledge the possibility that their “othering campaign” might have contributed to a death threat against a U.S. Senator serious enough to involve police, let’s hope that privately there is at least some soul searching going on.

Spring Break is a common ritual for students across the country, and First Daughter Malia Obama is no exception. But, of course, there is an important difference between the First Daughter and other students. When Malia Obama takes a trip, the American taxpayers get stuck with a hefty bill. How hefty? That’s what we’ve been trying to find out.
As you know, JW has kept close watch on the First Family’s extravagant personal trips for the American people, since we’re the ones footing the bill. And last week we released records detailing the government funds expended on Malia’s March 2012 Spring Break vacation to Mexico. According to the records, obtained from the U.S. Secret Service as a result of a Judicial Watch Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on September 20, 2012, the total cost of the trip amounted to $115,500.87. 
The following is a breakdown of the costs as detailed in the documents, which are available in full here:
Ground transportation:       $23,964.81
Lodging:                           $21,682.92
Airfare:                             $47,767.34
“Vouchers”:                       $21,636.14 (not itemized)
Support Charges:               $449.66 (travel for one from Mexico City to Oaxaca, not                                             itemized)
Malia Obama’s Spring Break trip evoked a significant amount of controversy after the Obama White House reportedly ordered the removal of press reports detailing the trip. 
On March 19, 2012, numerous online press outlets reported on Malia Obama’s Mexico trip, noting the fact that she was accompanied by 25 U.S. Secret Service Agents and as many as 12 of her friends. However, shortly after the press reports surfaced, they were quickly removed from the Internet. 
As reported by Politico: 
The AFP, the Huffington Post and other websites have scrubbed a report about first daughter Malia Obama’s school trip. On Monday, the AFP reported that Obama’s daughter was on a school trip along with a number of friends and 25 Secret Service agents. The story was picked up by Yahoo, the Huffington Post, and the International Business Times, as well as UK publications like the Daily Mail and the Telegraph and other overseas publications like The Australian. But on Monday night, the story had been removed from those sites.
In an update to this story, Politico published a statement issued by Kristina Schake, Communications Director to the First Lady, indicating that the removal of these news stories was “a White House effort:” 
“From the beginning of the administration, the White House has asked news outlets not to report on or photograph the Obama children when they are not with their parents and there is no vital news interest. We have reminded outlets of this request in order to protect the privacy and security of these girls.”
The trip reportedly took place shortly after the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statement advising students on Spring Break “to avoid Mexico.”  
I think we can all agree that in these economic times, with huge public debt and high unemployment, spending $115,000 in taxpayer funds on a Spring Break trip to Mexico is inappropriate. Is this what Americans are being asked to pay higher taxes for?
This is far from the first time the Obamas have taken advantage of the American taxpayer to enjoy expensive vacations.
We previously obtained records from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing Michelle Obama’s February 2012 President’s Day weekend ski vacation to Aspen, Colorado, with her two daughters. The records indicate U.S. Secret Service costs, including accommodations at the Fasching Haus deluxe condominium and the Inn at Aspen, were $48,950.38.
Judicial Watch also obtained documents from the United States Air Force and the United States Secret Service detailing costs associated with Michelle Obama’s controversial August 2010 vacation to Spain. According to a Judicial Watch analysis, the records indicate a total combined cost of at least $467,585.  
Judicial Watch also obtained documents detailing costs of a June 21-27, 2011, trip taken by Michelle Obama, her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana. Judicial Watch received mission expense records and passenger manifests for the Africa trip that described costs of $424,142 for the flight and crew alone. Other expenses, such as off-flight food, transportation, security, etc. were not included.
That’s a total of four trips at a cost of almost $1 million. And these are the trips we know about.
Rest assured, JW will continue to monitor these First Family excursions in a second Obama term. I suspect they will continue."

President Barack Obama rarely makes himself available to the mainstream media. They adore him anyway. At rare press conferences, such as the one scheduled for noon Friday at the White House, they lob softball questions or accept his evasive, meandering answers, rarely pressing him for clarity, much less truth. But there are many questions that the president ought to answer, yet which he is unlikely to face at all.
10. In 2008 you promised not to “do an end-run around Congress” with signing statements. Yet you have used signing statements and you have taken executive actions to circumvent Congress on immigration and other issues. Recently, you decided the employer mandate will not be enforced on October 1. Yet that date is stipulated by law. Doesn’t the Obamacare delay violate your powers under the Constitution?
9. Last week we learned that dozens of CIA personnel were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, and that there may be ongoing efforts to suppress information about what actually happened. In October 2012, you said that you issued three directives when you learned of the attack, yet these have never been seen. What did you actually do during the Benghazi attack, and why weren’t you more actively involved?
8. Last month, IRS officials testified to Congress that IRS Chief Counsel William J. Wilkins, whom you appointed, was directly involved in reviewing applications for non-profit status by Tea Party groups. He also met with you in April 2012, prior to issuing new “Be on the Lookout” (BOLO) criteria for evaluating such applications. What was your personal knowledge of the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups?
7. Recently your administration launched a new round of peace negotiations between Israel and Palestinian leaders. Israel had repeatedly said that it would negotiate without preconditions, but Palestinian leaders would not. Your administration, through Secretary of State John Kerry, pressed Israel to release 104 terrorists from Israeli jails. Was there a single new concession you demanded from Palestinians?
6. You have publicly dressed down the U.S. military on the issue of sexual assault. In the 2012 campaign, you were very involved in specific controversies, even calling Sandra Fluke, for example. Yet you have refused to say anything about the conduct of a fellow Democrat, Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego, who refuses to resign. Aren’t you setting a bad example on sexual assault, as commander-in-chief, in the Filner case?
5. Edward Snowden has continued to reveal new information about the National Security Agency’s abilities to gather information about Americans’ private communications. Leaving aside the question of whether the government should have that power, or whether you have broken past promises on civil liberties, the fact that these leaks happened at all is striking. Why is Gen. Keith Alexander still the head of the NSA?
4. Recently you announced that you were canceling a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Snowden issue and gay rights. Yet last month, even after Putin indicated he might offer Snowden asylum, you were still offering drastic cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal. It looks like the “reset” with Russia is a failure, after so many concessions. Isn’t it time to stop offering new cuts to U.S. nuclear weapons?
3. You are backing the Senate immigration bill, which passed because Democrats agreed to include border security measures. Regardless of whether those measures are sufficient, they depend on a commitment to enforce the law as written. Yet you have refused to enforce existing immigration laws, even imposing a so-called “Dream Act” by fiat. Why should Americans trust you to enforce a new immigration law?
2. You campaigned on the promise to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet you have helped the Taliban open a new office in Qatar, complicating relations with President Hamid Karzai, and recently suggested that there could be a “zero option” in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, as the U.S. withdraws, Al Qaeda is on the offensive across the region, and might return. Are we not repeating the mistakes of the past in Afghanistan?
1. You are about to head into a new round of budget negotiations. Some Republicans leaders have suggested that they are willing to offer concessions on the budget sequester if you commit to entitlement reform. You have spoken in theory about making some cuts but have never presented a plan, on paper, and have rejected all suggestions, even the Simpson-Bowles commission. Where is your plan to reform entitlements?
Bonus question: Last month, you spoke at length about how the African-American community views the death of Trayvon Martin case. You also asked people to respect the decision of the jury. Yet your Department of Justice is still aggressively investigating George Zimmerman, who is living in hiding, though all previous investigations showed no racial bias. Aren’t you violating Zimmerman’s civil rights?
UPDATE – Additional bonus question (from the comments): When you signed the Affordable Care Act, it included the Grassley amendment, subjecting members of Congress and their staff to the same rules as everyone else. Yet this week you signed off on special subsidies for members of Congress and their staff. Given your focus on inequality, how do you justify giving Congress Obamacare subsidies?
UPDATE 2 – Another bonus question (via Twitter): There is no longer any doubt that Nidal Hasan was motivated by radical Islamist beliefs. In May, you actually acknowledged for the first time that the Ft. Hood attack was an act of “Islamic jihad.” Yet your administration still considers is “workplace violence,” which denies victims certain benefits. Isn’t it time to declare the Ft. Hood shootings a terrorist act?"

Patrick Kennedy

Apparently having nothing better to do now that he is no longer in office, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, the eight-term congressman from Rhode Island, will unveil his personal crusade Wednesday in Denver. It's called Project SAM, Smart Approaches to Marijuana. It is anything but smart, however, what with its opposition to both medical marijuana and legalization of weed. He and those working with him say they seek a third way that ""neither legalizes, nor demonizes, marijuana.""
Thank goodness for small favors, Project SAM won't be promoting more of the arrests and lock-ups that have maimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans over eight decades for partaking of a mind-altering substance which all but the most stubborn opponents know causes harm to vastly fewer people than alcohol. That latter product has been legal in most of the nation for 80 years after a 14-year experiment with prohibition that helped make organized crime big business, exacerbated lethal violence and corrupted police departments from coast to coast as outlaw entrepreneurs sought to meet consumer demand.
Sound familiar? Just a few years after alcohol was re-legalized, marijuana was banned and has stayed that way for 75 years. Supplying the black market for the stuff is a gigantic business, both domestic and imported. The main foreign source is still Mexico, where the drug cartels whose wars have killed an estimated 50,000 people in the past seven years still get about half their profits from the marijuana trade. On the import side, the misbegotten War on Drugs launched 42 years ago by Richard Nixon has consumed a trillion (with a ""t"") dollars, which doesn't include income losses from people having their careers ruined or student loans chopped off because of marijuana convictions.
To his credit, Kennedy wants to see an end to such corrosive stupidity. But in its place, instead of legalization, he wants to impose mandatory drug treatment. That presumes everyone who uses marijuana is addicted or otherwise negatively affected. And this is, to put it plainly, bullshit. As is Kennedy's claim made Tuesday: “Marijuana destroys the brain and expedites psychosis. It’s just overall a very dangerous drug.”
For tens of millions of people, sir?
Disputing this idiocy doesn't mean marijuana isn't without health risks. It has some. Fact of life: Mind-altering substances of all kinds are dangerous to the mental health of a certain percentage of users.
But let's pretend for just a moment that legal marijuana would generate one-tenth the amount of mental illness, extra deaths, extra diseases, car and job accidents, bar fights, marital troubles, violent crimes and addictions as alcohol. I know, I know. Ludicrous. But just for the sake of argument, pretend. If someone could prove to a certainty, with psychic powers, say, that legalizing marijuana would become one tenth as deadly as legal alcohol, wouldn't that be a good reason to join Project SAM?
It might. Assuming, of course, that we were planning to crank up the old Temperance Union and fight to re-prohibit alcohol. Which we will never do.
Like alcohol, narcotics and other drugs, marijuana is not appropriate for underage individuals. People shouldn't drive, hunt or operate chainsaws while high. And, of course, some people are fools sober or high and will do things they shouldn't. But adults should not be forced to accept a misdemeanor or felony marijuana conviction on their record unless, as Kennedy is proposing, they submit to treatment that they don't need for consuming a substance that, for most users, does not cause mental problems, reduce their IQs or spur them to start mainlining heroin or smoking meth.
In the place of medical marijuana, now legal in 20 states, Kennedy wants extracted cannabinoids to be used. That's fine for ailments on which these extracts work. But that is not the case with many afflictions. There is apparently a beneficial synergy among at least some of the many chemicals in marijuana that extracts cannot achieve on their own.
How about instead of Kennedy's ""third way"" nonsense we just stop arresting people for using marijuana? Period. How about legalizing cultivation and sale under strict regulation and taxing?
Too extreme? Compared with what? The f'n War on Drugs?
Perhaps, since Patrick Kennedy has a history of alcohol, cocaine and oxycontin abuse, including driving under the influence, he might try focusing his crusade on the problems associated with substances he knows more intimately instead of one with an overdose death rate of zero and extremely low incidences of triggering violent behavior. Kennedy and the other crusaders involved with Project SAM, like former Bush speechwriter David Frum and former White House economic adviser Austin Goolsbee, who sit on its board, may be well intended. But their third-way approach is way way off the mark.

No California business for you!

The rivalry between Texas and California is no secret, and it goes far beyond the fact that they are the two most populous states in the nation. While neither state is monolithic in terms of its political ideology—Texas has deep-blue Austin while some inland parts of California are a startling shade of crimson—the politics of each state has been marked by radically different ideologies. California's main power bases of economic and political power include two of the places conservatives most love to hate: San Francisco and Hollywood. Meanwhile, every single statewide elected official is a Democrat, and Democrats have dominated the state legislature, despite the roadblocks along the way. In recent years, the state government has sought to invest in projects like high-speed rail and solar energy, often taxing itself for the privilege Texas, of course, is just the opposite: a conservative ideological paradise funded substantially by the oil industry, with low taxes and a belief that government is the problem, not the solution.
Because of its ideological ramifications, the rivalry between Texas and California is more than just competition for bragging rights between the nations two heaviest hitters; rather, it is ground zero in an ideological proxy war between the progressive and conservative factions of larger-scale national politics. And in recent years, as the Lone Star State was experiencing its so-called ""Texas Miracle"" while California was limping along from budget crisis to budget crisis, it was far from uncommon for conservative ideologues to point to the contrast between the two as evidence of the success of conservative economic policy.
Unfortunately for them, the tide has turned on this view. First, the so-called Texas Miracle turned out to be a sham masked by a combination of rapid population growth, high oil prices and low wages. Ironically enough, it was billions of dollars in stimulus funds that was propping up Texas' budget solvency. When that ran out and the economic crisis finally showed its full effects, the state faced a crippling budget deficit of $27 billion, and was forced to make massive cuts to Medicaid and education to stay afloat.
California, meanwhile, has been on exactly the opposite trajectory. The voters, sick of the tax revolt that had been artificially maintained by the Republican minority, voted in a series of structural reforms that loosened the minority's stranglehold in Sacramento and followed that up by passing two tax measures to promote green energy and protect our schools from further cuts. Combined with the economic recovery that has been taking place nationwide, these changes were enough to put California's budget back in the black for the first time in many years, even as Texas suffers from high poverty, low wages and a drastically failing education system.
Join me below the fold to learn more about why the economic miracle in Texas was really a mirage.


Texas' economic success, then, was more mirage than miracle. But even had it been sustained, it could never have been a model suitable for nationwide implementation. As Krugman explains:
What Texas shows is that a state offering cheap labor and, less important, weak regulation can attract jobs from other states. I believe that the appropriate response to this insight is “Well, duh.” The point is that arguing from this experience that depressing wages and dismantling regulation in America as a whole would create more jobs — which is, whatever Mr. Perry may say, what Perrynomics amounts to in practice — involves a fallacy of composition: every state can’t lure jobs away from every other state.
In fact, at a national level lower wages would almost certainly lead to fewer jobs — because they would leave working Americans even less able to cope with the overhang of debt left behind by the housing bubble, an overhang that is at the heart of our economic problem.

This job-poaching practice serves as the context behind Texas Gov. Rick Perry's latest media gimmick: a tiny media buy and a poaching tour throughout California, wherein he sought to visit California businesses in an attempt to convince them to relocate or expand to Texas. A primary focus of Perry's efforts is a company located on the Southern edge of California's Central Coast, Haas Automation, which claims it is unhappy doing business in California and is considering offers from other states.
Conservatives love to promote the narrative that businesses are leaving California in droves because of high taxes and regulation, but the truth is an entirely different story:
Conservatives have made hay of reports of California companies leaving the state. And it's true! Some have—254 in 2011, to be exact. Conservative media had a field day with that little stat. On the other hand, 132,000 new businesses were created that same year—second highest per capita in the nation, tied with Texas, and behind only Arizona. And that was California's down year.
As Markos also wrote:
California leads the nation in job creation because it is the world center for both entertainment and technology. Even foreign corporations, like Samsung, house their R&D in Silicon Valley for obvious reasons—this is where the talent and venture money lives. And yes, the things that make California awesome (like infrastructure, education, entertainment) cost money. But we appreciate those things, which is why we voted ourselves tax increases.
Turns out that businesses actually like to be here and love to start here. Maybe that's why Gov. Perry's trip was a massive failure:
On a conference call with reporters from Laguna Beach, the Republican said he spent his four days meeting with entrepreneurs and business leaders and held a reception for more than 200 California companies that have expressed interest in moving to Texas. His office later clarified, though, that the reception was actually with only 20 businesses.
Such relocations can take time, but Perry also offered no details on prospects, much less concrete announcements.

If Gov. Perry wants to recruit high-tech businesses from California to Texas, perhaps he should stop spending time in California making a failed sales pitch and spend more time at home fixing his state's poverty crisis and broken education system by actually investing in his state's people, instead of forcing his people to fall to the lowest common denominator of his state's laissez-faire business climate. Maybe he should lead by example and learn about California before visiting the next time. Who knows? He might actually learn that we have an energy industry.

277,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/06/Obama-Boehner-tired-spending,News,Breitbart,Republican,Obama to Boehner: 'We Don't Have a Spending Problem',"
In an interview with Stephen Moore of the Wall Street Journal, newly re-elected House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) opened up about President Obama’s utter unwillingness to cut a single dollar from federal spending. In a stunning admission, Obama reportedly told Boehner, “We don’t have a spending problem.”
Boehner added that President Obama continues to maintain that America’s federal deficit is caused not by governmental overspending but by “a health-care problem.” Said Boehner, “They blame all of the fiscal woes on our health-care system.” Boehner told Obama, “Clearly we have a health-care problem, which is about to get worse with Obamacare. But, Mr. President, we have a very serious spending problem.” Obama eventually replied, “I’m getting tired of hearing you say that.”
Obama may be tired of hearing Boehner talk about a spending problem, particularly when Obama has been re-elected on the basis of ignoring government spending. Nonetheless, America does have a spending problem, which Obama is steadfastly ignoring. “He’s so ideological himself,” Boehner explained, “and he’s unwilling to take on the left of his own party.” That’s why Obama refused to raise the retirement age for Medicare after agreeing to it. “He admitted in meetings that he couldn’t sell things to his own members,” said Boehner. “But he didn’t even want to try … We could never get him to step up.”
Boehner says that there will be no new tax increases over the debt ceiling. “The tax issue is resolved,” he said. And he said that more closed-door negotiations with Obama would be “futile.” It’s a bit too late to recognize that, but better late than never.
Obama need not negotiate on spending. He can just continue to bully Republicans by suggesting that they are the party of the rich – and his media lackeys can pretend that it’s fiscally irresponsible to ask the government to live within its means.

Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) had a dire prediction for America about sequestration, claiming that 170 million jobs would be lost as a result of the across-the-board cuts. But according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are only about 140 million jobs in the whole country.
During a press conference on February 28, Waters told reporters of a visit by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who told members of congress that sequestration is not the optimal way to cut the federal budget.
Talking of Bernanke’s comments, Waters claimed that “if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost.”
However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A-9, Selected Employment Indicators, in January of 2013 there were 141,614 million jobs in the current American economy.
Using Waters’ math, the US would lose about 30 million more jobs than it had to start with.
Yesterday we did have Mr. Bernanke in our committee and he came to tell us what he’s doing with quantitative easing and that is trying to stimulate the economy with the bond purchases that he’s been doing because he’s trying to keep the interest rates low and create jobs–and he said that if sequestration takes place, that’s going to be a great setback. We don’t need to be having something like sequestration that’s going to cause these jobs losses, over 170 million jobs that could be lost–and so he made it very clear he’s not opposed to cuts but cuts must be done over a long period of time and in a very planned way rather than this blunt cutting that will be done by sequestration.
As you know in this committee we have all of HUD and HUD is responsible for so many programs that determine the quality of life for women and families. CBDG, a form of grant programs will be cut by $153 million dollars. These are grants to cities that help with women and children and low-income programs.
We also will cut the Home Program by $52 million if sequestration takes place, Native American Housing grants by $34 million, House and Choice grants $113 million, Public Housing–mostly single women in Public Housing–another $304 million, and homelessness, everybody claims to be concerned about homelessness and the growing number of women and children who are out their homeless but look they will take a $99 million dollar hit and on and on and on.
And so, we are here today, one more time, talking about women and children and families and how we can protect our women, children, and families and have a decent quality of life–sequestration will set us back. All of the gains that we have made will be lost with sequestration."
279,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/02/Obama-debt-ceiling,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Who Will Stop Bully Obama on Debt Ceiling?,"
With President Obama set to precipitate a constitutional crisis over the upcoming debt ceiling, Republicans in Congress must now stand up to the bullying commander in chief. 
Yesterday, after the fiscal cliff had been passed through Congress, President Obama claimed victory. “Just recently,” he told supporters, “Republicans in Congress said they’d never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans. We’ve now raised those rates, permanently, making our tax code more progressive than it’s been in decades.”
But more important than Obama’s triumphalism was his insistence that he will not – repeat, will not – negotiate over the debt ceiling. At all. “While I will negotiate over many things,” Obama said, “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed.” Of course, Obama has racked up those bills, and it is he who refuses to pay the freight with any cuts whatsoever. But now he’s declaring the unilateral authority to avoid discussing the debt ceiling. “What the president was saying was, ‘I’m not going to play chicken with the debt limit,'” said Jen Psaki, Obama’s spokeswoman.
Under the Constitution of the United States, the House of Representatives has the power of the purse strings. It is Congress that decides whether or not to incur more debt, not the president. And yet Obama has essentially stated that he will not stand for any negotiation surrounding that Congressional power.
That’s tyrannical. But unlike in the past, the Democrats in Congress are willing to go along with such systemic perversion. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has shown himself quite willing to give Obama unlimited power to raise the debt ceiling. 
So the question now is whether Republicans will stand strong against this unconstitutional aggression from President Obama. In 2011, Republicans in Congress caved, and ended up with the pathetic fiscal cliff proposal that set up massive tax increases and an across-the-board cut. Then they made that cave complete in order to avoid those default tax increases.
Now, however, they have a second chance to stand tall. But they will have to stand together, and they will have to hold Obama’s feet to the fire. The issue of the debt ceiling is about more than spending. It is about whether we have a Constitutional system worth preserving, or whether the President should be allowed to run roughshod over it. Speaker of the House John Boehner has been re-elected — and in achieving re-election, he has given himself a second bite at an apple he missed in 2011, during that disastrous debt ceiling debate. The time for compromise is finished. Our thug president ended it. Republicans must realize that, and act accordingly.

To help get them stoked, I put together a list of the President's accomplishments over the last four years.  Actually, many folks had already created lists of accomplishments (See sources at bottom).  So, I simply consolidated them, added some unique categories, and made sure all were footnoted.  The results of this labor are below.  My dashboard fundraising page will refer them to Daily Kos and this diary.  Feel free to reuse the list as you wish, especially if you choose to build a Dashboard Grassroots Fundraising page of your own.  It's easy.
BTW, my dashboard fundraising page is named ""PocketChangeForObama"" because I thought it would be fun to pit my friends' pockets against the Koch brothers checkbooks!  My contribution began by pulling my wallet out, totaling the available bills, and making a contribution of that amount on the Dashboard to kick off our group's fundraising campaign.  Change is in our pockets.  Voila!
One final observation about the President's accomplishments.  We are all aware that the Republicans will be just as uncooperative in the future as in the past  four years.     In reviewing these lists I was struck by how much the President accomplished with Executive Orders and other specified constitutional powers.  If the President wins again, much more will be possible even without a dance partner in Congress!!

Oh. Oh dear. (Right Wing Watch)



Oh. Oh dear. (Right Wing Watch)

Oh, heavens, whatever shall become of our fair republic:
Approximately 100 conservative activists gathered in front of the White House on Tuesday for a kickoff of what organizers call ""the second American revolution.""
The event could easily have been mistaken for a tea party rally, with American and Gadsden flags, a smattering of biker jackets and a few lawn chairs.
Freedom Watch founder Larry Klayman, who emceed the event, told attendees if President Barack Obama does not resign by Nov. 29, conservative activists will meet in Philadelphia to elect a shadow government.

Two people per state? That's not a revolution, that's a Senate. If this shadow government is going to contain a full House as well, they're going to have to start appointing pets and toasters.
You have probably heard of Larry Klayman before. If not, no worries—but I should clarify that this is the loudmouthed neorevolutionary wingnut that has not been arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, not the one who has. Yes, it can get confusing. While the other revolutionary is all about being able to carry guns wherever you want because you never know when the mushrooms will kick in, this one is still on the whole Obama is possibly a Kenyan kick, plus also ""Benghazi-gate"" and the shutting down of our precious war memorials, etc., and so forth.
Alright, so Mr. Klayman has said that if President Obama does not resign by the sacred date of Black Friday, he and other likeminded crackpots will immediately meet, perhaps on what shall henceforth be known as Honky Saturday, to elect their own shadow government. One that is not from Kenya, and is not a secret Musslim and so forth:
Bishop Dan Johnson of the Heart of Fire Church in Louisville, Ky., prayed with ralliers, asking God to ""cause [elected officials] to get on their knees, not to Allah, but to God almighty."" In his prayer, Johnson denounced homosexuality, permissive parenting, pornography and welfare.
In addition to a bewigged George Washington impersonator and the editor of conspiracy website World Net Daily Joseph Farah because, well, duh, there was also a former congressman on hand to lend the proceedings another few shovelfuls of skin-crawling creepiness.
""We have a scoundrel living in that building,"" [Former Rep. Bob Barr] said, pointing at the White House, ""and need to do something about it.""
Ew, I thought that fellow had died. I suppose he might have, and his speech could have just been gas escaping—please get on that hypothesis, Mr. Farah, America demands an answer.
So there you go: the revolution is upon us, at least once they decide between Denny's and Olive Garden for the ceremonies. Never have so few given so little to scream so loudly—true patriots, all. Someday each one of them will be commemorated on trading cards, a little paperboard sea of revolutionary flags and trucker hats.
God speed, heroes, and remember to leave the 'shrooms at home.

GOP Rep. Cynthia Lummis wants
people to lobby Congress to stop
the sequester

Conservatives love cheering government spending cuts...
Just ask Wyoming’s lone House member, Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R), who applauded the $85 billion carved across the board in a letter to constituents.
“Instead of blindly filling empty desks,” she wrote last week, “federal agencies will be forced to consider which positions are crucial and make their decision based on necessity rather than luxury.”

...until they hit home, like they did last week at Yellowstone National Park in Lummis's home state of Wyoming, where park superintendent Dan Wenk froze his workforce and delayed the start of seasonal hiring and plowing after being ordered to cut $1.8 million from his budget due to sequestration. The cuts will hurt Yellowstone tourism, delivering a blow to the region's economy, but thanks to cheerleaders of sequestration like Lummis, Wenk's hands were tied.
When Lummis was confronted with angry constituents, the obvious thing to do would have been to support repealing or replacing the sequester. Instead, she invented a fantasy in which Wenk was the villain, because instead of cutting his operating budget he should have lobbied Congress for permission to cut his capital budget. But not only was her ""solution"" not actually a solution, it would have actually increased spending over the long-run.
In an interview, Lummis suggested that Wenk petition House and Senate appropriators for permission to take money from his capital budget to cover the cuts, an idea he said was not legal and would never get through Congress in time.
Beyond the absurdity of a member of Congress urging one of her constituents to solve his problem by lobbying Congress, it would be astonishingly stupid to shift money from capital projects to current operations when interest rates are as low as they are. If you neglect long-term capital projects, sooner or later the bill will come due, and the longer you wait, the bigger the bill will be—and interest rates are bound to be higher when they do. Unless you're planning to let your most core assets rot, in the long-run it's cheaper to act earlier with low interest rates, and you get the side benefit of whatever capital improvements you've made.
Basically, what Lummis says Wenk should have asked for is like that old saying about shuffling deck chairs on the Titanic, except instead of telling him to shuffle the deck chairs, she's saying he should have asked the crew for permission to shuffle the deck chairs—never mind the fact that she's a member of the crew. If this is the kind of genius Wyoming sends to Congress, they get what they deserve. It's just a shame that those of us who didn't vote for Lummis have to suffer the consequences as well.
Meanwhile, Republicans are still whining about losing their White House tour perk even as real people are getting hurt. Please tell them to stop bellyaching and do something about the sequester.

The news of the day is obviously President Barack Obama's second inauguration, but yesterday on Meet the Press, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) made some news of his own:
Senate Democrats will draft a budget blueprint for the first time in four years and use it to fast-track an overhaul of the tax code that is intended to raise significant revenue over the next decade, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said on Sunday.
On Friday, House Republicans waved the white flag of surrender on the debt limit, saying they would raise the ceiling as long as the Senate agreed to make their salary contingent on producing a budget. Technically, that's still a ransom demand, but it's like going from demanding all the gold at Fort Knox to demanding a $5 gift certificate at Glenn Beck's favorite gold e-tailer. Budget documents aren't the same as spending bills—guidelines for spending levels intended to control the budget-making process. They can also include reconciliation instructions, and as we saw with the passage of Obamacare, reconciliation allows the Senate to move forward on legislation without the threat of filibuster.
According to Schumer, Senate Democrats will use reconciliation instructions to provide guidance on tax hikes, allowing the Senate to completely bypass the filibuster. Of course, being able to avoid the filibuster doesn't much matter if House Republicans won't go along with tax increases, but check out this nugget from The New York Times:
A senior Republican tax aide confirmed that Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the Ways and Means chairman, planned to push forward this year with “revenue-neutral” tax reform, with the revenue target adjusted upward to the amount raised by the higher tax rates on the wealthy approved this month to resolve most of the so-called fiscal cliff.
The Republican aide said if the Senate can approve tax changes that raise revenues, it is possible that difficult negotiations between the two chambers could produce a final deal that would produce more tax revenue – but not as much as the Senate wants.

Yes, that's just an anonymous aide, so take it with the appropriate level of skepticism, but I still think it's noteworthy that an anonymous GOP aide is dropping hints at accepting new tax revenues through tax reform. In light of the comments, if I had to guess how things will play out form here it'd be this: The sequester will get replaced by a deficit reduction package that includes some new revenue through tax reform, a matching amount of cuts to Social Security and Medicare (but not Medicaid) contingent on the success of tax reform, and a different set of domestic and defense discretionary cuts to replace the ones in the sequester (which won't be contingent on anything). When that package is done, it will effectively mean the ""Grand Bargain"" is achieved. Republicans will grumble, but won't push forward on government shutdown. The White House, meanwhile, will turn its focus from deficit reduction to other policy areas. Of course, that's just my prediction of what will happen. As always, I reserve the right to be wrong.

The house that dumb built.



The house that dumb built.

I'm not sure that there's much nuance to be parsed out about the sequester and why we seem to be headed for it despite it being plainly and obviously the worst possible thing to do. The problem is that the one actually sensible solution—to just dump the whole idea, as Congress can do at any point during this entire ridiculous, posturing debacle—isn't politically palatable to any of the involved groups. Sure, the sequester will foul up the economy, hurt a hell of a lot of people and botch up important government functions all around the nation, but as of right now both parties see ""screw up the entire American economy, again"" as being preferable to any of the achievable political alternatives.
The Republicans know the partial shutdown of services is going to hurt—a lot. They also know they're going to be blamed for it, no matter what little Twitter hashtags they deploy to the contrary, and that once people with government jobs or government contracts actually start getting furloughed, costing them a hefty chunk of their paychecks, people are quickly going to become irate. Every small town in America is going to be awash with the news of what's been cut, and how many local residents are being furloughed, and how that's going to affect the rest of the local economy, and they'll all be duly noting that there was abso-effing-lutely no reason for it other than this stupid ""cut everything because governmenting is hard and stuff"" plan.
The problem for Republicans, however, is that they've premised nearly all of their obsessive anti-Obama rhetoric around the notions that (1) the government can't create jobs, (2) all government is bad, and (3) the scary deficit monster is going to kill us all. They can't stomach voting to lift the sequester when that means acknowledging (1) that government does indeed employ lots of people, (2) it does indeed do stuff that their constituents like, and need, and (3) the deficit is in fact not currently as important as the more immediate task of not screwing up the tenuous national economy, because Basic Economics. You can hear them already in the early stages of talking-point disarray on the topic, but Republicans are supposed to be for harsh, painful cuts to government. That's their brand. (True, they want different cuts, but the different cuts are just as deep and egregious, they were just supposed to be in things that Republicans, well, hated more. When you're cutting this deep during this economy, though, you're going to hit bone no matter where you put the knife.)
So for Republicans, the only way to dodge the sequester is to fess up that their entire debt ceiling freakout, and all of their demands afterwards, and all of the loudest premises of their electoral existence in these last few campaigns were all mere bluff. The only escape hatch that the White House is providing is the original plan that would mitigate the nastiness of the cuts by coming up with new revenues, i.e. new taxes; again, this requires Republicans not just going against campaign promises, but abandoning their entire supposed economic philosophy on the subject, period. Forget ideological integrity in these things: You have to acknowledge that even if the Republicans wanted to ditch every austerian, anti-legitimacy-of-government, anti-revenue principle they've been working themselves into a froth over during these last years, they're at least going to need a little more time to come up with a creative explanation for it. A new Twitter hashtag isn't going to cover that one.
The Republicans have invested themselves so heavily in these two brands of economic extremism that they are now ingrained into everything the Republican Party stands for. Whether those previous assertions mesh with plain reality or with the political needs of the moment (or, God help them, a phalanx of furious donors and lobbyists whose industries are about to be hit with that same axe) is irrelevant now. They're screwed. The sequester represents government as they advocated for it to be run: sharp, painful cuts done with an axe instead of a scalpel. They stood up and demanded it outright, during the debt ceiling fight. Then they all signed onto a law to do just that. If they're complaining, it's only because they only now realized that their demanded fantasy plan is about to be put into action, and that the results might not be the glowing American utopia that they've been promising. Follow me below the fold for more of the stupid.


The White House, on the other hand, is heavily invested in Grand Bargainism. They seem equally averse to suggesting the obvious plan, proposing Congress simply nix the ridiculously premised sequester and move on to smaller, more focused budget efforts like sensible people. In part that may be because they know the first side to suggest substantively weakening the sequester will then be the ""pro-deficit"" and ""big government"" side in the other party's pissy talking points for the next decade; in larger part, it seems to be because the administration itself is (yet again) so enamored with striking a Big Budget Deal that they are (yet again) pushing for the Big Budget Deal even when it's not necessary or wise. This was the same dynamic that led the White House into previous catastrophic ""negotiations"" with Congress as to whether or not the nation would shut down or default on its debts, negotiations which legitimized those same Republican threats in a rather stumbling attempt by the White House to reach some supposed ""larger"" agreement that would, in their minds, neutralize further budget fights for a while. The entire premise that any sufficiently ""large"" agreement would result in the other side not asking for more afterwards seems to be the height of political gullibility; nonetheless, that's what happened, and that's what kept happening in subsequent, related posturing, and all indications suggest that we're about to repeat the exact same thing.
So to the White House, accepting a bevy of damaging austerity-premised cuts is still considered a good bargain, if they can either (1) pry out tax concessions from the Republicans, which is at this point a goal unto itself, or (2) if the end result is ""big"" enough that the White House feels they won't have to do this crap again for a year or two. Not inspiring stuff, but again: There's no particular incentive on their parts to avoid the sequester outright. Sure, it'll hurt the economy, but Republicans will be blamed, a deal will be struck sooner or later or even later than that, then boom, victory.
As for House and Senate Democrats? They don't seem to even enter into things. They hold veto power over whatever the administration and Republicans decide to do, but as advocates for any other outcome, they're nonexistent. Again, because ""how about we not screw up the entire economy as political prank"" is right out, from a party messaging standpoint, leaving us only to debate how badly we'll be screwing it up and who will get what portion of the blame afterwards.
It's the precise dynamic of the debt ceiling fight, except this time, if possible, it's even worse because both sides have now fully embraced the rather strange notion that the economy isn't as important as enforcing a little austerity right now and damn the consequences. The fight is between the far right and the Simpson-Bowles right: all good, reasonable villagers agree that we need to screw retirees and others on the economic fringes, we're just haggling over who and how much. (Centrist ""victory"" in these matters will consist of getting Republicans to raise tax revenue after Republicans spent an entire eight-year administration lowering that same tax revenue to plainly unsustainable levels, which sounds like just asking those Republicans to exercise some common sense, and in fact is exactly that so good luck with it.)

So that's why we're at where we're at. The Republicans can't blink without looking like they're backing down on every one of their most cherished and loudly shouted supposed fiscal principles, principles that made their appearance in the debt ceiling fight and which caused this whole wreck of a thing in the first place. That's assuming, mind you, they have enough party unity left to even make a decision either way, which itself is far from a given. The White House thinks that no matter how bad things may be at this point or may get, they've at least finally got a good hand, and that they'll be able to bring Republicans back to the bargaining table after the very real bite of the sequester starts making for some very, very angry constituents back in Republican hometowns, thus finally leading the two sides to a lovely bipartisan agreement on some unknown (and, in all probability, disproportionately small) new amount of new tax revenues.
Sequester, here we come.
There's always the possibility that either side will blink. Even though the sequester is allegedly a Republican dream (Cutting the entire discretionary federal budget by an arbitrary percentage for no good reason? Be still my Norquistian heart!), the Republicans are unambiguously in the weaker position for the simple reasons that (1) the sequester is economically untenable for any period longer than a few days or weeks, and (2) the public is going to blame the jackasses who have been loudly cheering for government cuts when those cuts happen and start to hurt, because duh. Nonetheless, Republicans can't not shoot that hostage, because they said they would.
The White House might also cave for considerably less than their purported targets. Good money might even bet on that outcome, in fact, given the past (cough) history involved. And while I'm not a fan of the White House premise of using this same hostage to again attempt ""grand bargain"" revenue concessions, given that their role in avoiding the sequester is at this point merely advisory, there's not particularly any other path for them to take. True, they could beg House Republicans to simply call the whole thing off, but that argument is an obvious non-starter, so it won't happen. In any event, Grand Bargaining is in the air, God help us all.
So that's that. A very, very large number of Americans are about to be hurt for no particular reason other the Republican (and Officially Serious Villager, we must not forget) demand that we cut government and the deficit right the hell now, full stop, end of discussion. A very large number of Americans will be losing pay, they'll be losing needed services—they'll be losing things as basic as local airports that stay open. The desired outcome of this plan for both parties is to then establish a set of smaller or different cuts, possibly including the dramatic inclusion of slightly more tax revenue, and the prime long-term question is whether this entire process will merely stall the current, tenuous economic recovery or will, in some areas, kill it outright.
Make sense? Of course it doesn't. As an ideological belief, the current sudden-onset deficit fetishism was never meant to make sense in the first place. As with most things stubbornly ideological, however, merely knowing before the fact that it is a horrible, stupid, and clearly damaging idea is insufficient reason to not do it.

This could be your next flag soon unless you act. Seriously.



This could be your next flag soon unless you act. Seriously.

Historian Bruce Bartlett wrote an interesting post in The New York Times' Economix column, underscoring how the far right's apparent desire to force an actual default has deep historical roots - roots that seem to trace back to the same origins of the know-nothingism that is at the source of Tea Party nuttiness - the U.S. Civil War. Bartlett, a key supply-side economics advisor in both Reagan and G.H.W. Bush administrations, is hardly a left-wing firebrand, so you have to take his assessment very seriously.
What Bartlett's post underscores for me is that we are in the middle of what Tea Party advocates seem hope is nothing less than the destruction of The United States of America itself- a goal that has been fomenting since the formation of our nation.
More after the break.


Bartlett points out that the southern states were very angry about the U.S. requirement not to honor the debt of the Confederate States of America after the war, which triggered concerns that the south would try to get the U.S. to do likewise with its debt as southern representative re-entered Congress after the war. The result was the 14th amendment, which, in addition to codifying the abolition of slavery, included in its Section 4 the guarantee to honor all U.S. debts.
The fact that the debt issue was stuck in the face of the southern states in the same constitutional amendment as slavery abolition civil rights guarantees should not go unnoticed for either its symbolic value or for its roots as a point of contention with the Tea Party, which draws upon white resentments in the south and elsewhere fueled by the rise of civil rights laws in the 1960s. The Tea Party draws on white supremacist sentiment that has been a part of U.S. history since its beginnings, augmenting it with pro-Nazi sentiments fueled by the so-called Fellowship Foundation of ""key men"" (and, sometimes, women) starting in the mid-20th century. Their purpose is completely clear; split the U.S. so that it can be destroyed, and replaced with a far right police state benefiting a few elites.
As with the rise of Hitler during Germany's Weimar Republic, the Tea Party uses economic and social chaos to fuel its rise. It undermines faith in democratic processes at every turn, so that people will favor ""strong man"" governments - governments that will benefit the ""key men"" first and foremost and further the redistribution of wealth from average people to the elites. The Nazis of Weimar Germany also used resentment against Europe and moderate Germans for the perceived unfairness of war reparation payments after World War I to fuel nationalism, much in the same way that the Tea Party fuels resentment against the fall of the ""Southern Cause"" with its encouragement of Confederate flag-waving and the use of the proxy Gadsden Flag from South Carolina's troops in the War of Independence.
What we are engaged in is not an economic fight, or even a political fight. What we're engaged in is in fact a fight for the last chance for a democracy in the United States for the foreseeable future. The billionaire lords of the Tea Party. like the industrialists backing Hitler, want to wage economic and military war on anyone who might interfere with their accretion of wealth, both in this nation and beyond. Their ""values"" issues, while certainly a part of their outlook, are largely tools for a much more agnostic and pagan goal: power and wealth for its own sake, with the state as the crowning mechanism for their goals.
Sadly, I don't think that the U.S. public really gets this - or really gets that they are in a battle where they are still the majority against this hardened and fantasy-based group of extremists. Hitler rose to power in part because everyday people became exhausted, beaten down by harsh economic realities, a beating aided and abetted by a flaccid and complacent media. So it is again today. Little has been learned in a century, unfortunately, it would seem.
We do have hope and we do have options, but people are tired, and they need to feel that they have hope. This is what's lacking in the political dialogue right now. Obama is doing his best to fuel that courage and that hope, but it will take a lot more grass roots activism to overcome the Tea Party. They can command endless hours of news coverage simply by having a few of their relatives and friends wave Confederate flags in front of the White House. They call for massive rallies that never materialize - except in the news media's perception that declaring these things to be so makes them so.
We have to create our own reality for the sake of U.S. democracy, and soon, otherwise there will be no union left to save. If that seems to be an exaggeration, look at how the German people allowed democracy to slip away from their own nation. The fact of the matter is that, one way or another, we are still engaged in a great Civil War for American democracy, testing whether this nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure, as Abraham Lincoln put it. The enemies of democracy laid down their arms only in part more than 150 years ago. The final battle of that war is upon us. It is up to us as a people to decide how to fight it, but the fight has been brought to us regardless. We have only to choose how to respond.
Let's hope for the best - and fight for it.

In 2012, Paul Ryan said looming automatic budget cuts had encouraged the attack in Benghazi



In 2012, Paul Ryan said looming automatic budget cuts had encouraged the attack in Benghazi

In light of Paul Ryan's newfound rediscovered appreciation for the spending sequester's automatic defense and domestic cuts, let's take a trip back in time to four months ago when Ryan was making the case during the 2012 vice presidential debate that the sequester's potential spending cuts emboldened the terrorists who attacked the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Responding to a question about Mitt Romney's rash response to the attack, Ryan said:
Let's recall that they [the Obama administration] disavowed their own statement that they had put out earlier in the day in Cairo. So we had the same position, but we will -- it's never too early to speak out for our values.
We should have spoken out right away when the green revolution was up and starting; when the mullahs in Iran were attacking their people. We should not have called Bashar Assad a reformer when he was turning his Russian-provided guns on his own people. We should always stand up for peace, for democracy, for individual rights.
And we should not be imposing these devastating defense cuts, because what that does when we equivocate on our values, when we show that we're cutting down on defense, it makes us more weak. It projects weakness. And when we look weak, our adversaries are much more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks, and are allies are less willing to...

And with those ellipses Vice President Joe Biden could not take any more of Ryan's nonsense. He interrupted Ryan, and said that Ryan's statement was—you guessed it—""a bunch of malarkey."" Biden was right, but now that Ryan once again supports moving forward with those spending cuts, isn't it fair to conclude that Ryan—by his own logic—is standing with the terrorists? Yes, that's absurd, but in my defense, I'm not agreeing with Ryan—I'm just taking his argument to the logical conclusion.
Continue below the fold to find out how Ryan's argument gets even more knotty—it turns out that he not only voted for the sequester, but in 2011 proposed the exact same level of military spending as the president.


It turns out that Ryan's position gets even more knotty, because it's not just the he now supports something that he said in 2012 would undermine America, it's also that he actually supported the legislation that originally created the cuts that he he subsequently opposed and now supports again. Take another trip down memory lane to re-experience Ryan trying to B.S. his way out of that:
NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS News): Congressman, these defense cuts are part of the Budget Control Act. You voted for the Budget Control Act. In fact I went and looked, you put on the a statement at the time it was passed and you called it a victory, and you called it a positive step forward.
So, you voted for defense cuts. And now you're criticizing the president for those same defense cuts that you voted for and called a victory.
RYAN: No, no, I have to correct you on this, Norah. I voted for a mechanism that says a sequester will occur if we don't cut $1.2 trillion spending in government.

No, Norah. You're wrong. I didn't vote for it. Instead, I voted for it. So don't say I didn't vote for it, because I did vote for it. Er, I mean, don't say I did vote for it. Because I don't support it now. But I did vote for it. And I reserve the right to say whatever the fuck I please at any point in the future. Okay?
O'DONNELL: Congressman, it's my understanding that as part of the Budget Control Act there was not just the sequestration, the defense sequestration, but there is also $1 trillion in immediate spending cuts, which included the defense cuts, almost $400 billion that were proposed by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mr. Dempsey, as well as Secretary Panetta. And you also voted for those.
And now you're saying that you didn't vote for them?
RYAN: We can get into this nomenclature. I voted for the Budget Control Act but the Obama administration proposed $470 billion in defense cuts. We don't agree with that. Our budget rejected that. And then on top of that is another $500 billion in defense cuts.
O'DONNELL: Right, it's a trillion in defense spending. And you voted for it.
RYAN: No, Norah, I voted for the Budget Control Act.
O'DONNELL: That included defense spending.
RYAN: Norah, you're mistaken.

Yeah, Norah. Get your facts straight. Congressman Paul Ryan only voted for whatever he voted for that serves his particular needs at this very moment. Don't go getting technical and stuff about what he did or didn't vote for and what it did or didn't do. That's irrelevant. What matters is Paul Ryan has killer dimples and tremendous abs. And he will get wonky with anybody. Literally, anybody. Anytime, anywhere. Wonk off on demand.
Meanwhile, speaking of wonking off, let's be fair to Paul Ryan. Because even though he spent the 2012 campaign demagoguing on defense spending, the one good thing about his 2011 budget proposal was that he didn't propose spending a single dime more on defense than President Obama.

Click to enlarge
That's from page S-4 of Ryan's 2011 budget plan. Notice all those zeroes? That's the difference between President Obama's budget proposal and Paul Ryan's proposal: nothing. So in more ways than one, by flip-flopping on his 2012 position on defense cuts, Ryan is going back to where he started in 2011.
Personally, I think this obsession with the deficit is misguided, but given the existence of the obsession, there are worse things Paul Ryan has done than embracing the sequester's spending cuts. But as long as that's what he's doing, he should have the courage to admit it, unless all this stuff about wonkiness is just a smokescreen to disguise the fact that he is, at core, just a typical political hack.

No one can argue with the fact that Paul Ryan’s compromise budget bill raises taxes and increases spending. Show me one Republican who got elected on that platform. Spare America the Orwellian word games. If the government is taking money out of your pocket to fund its growing Big Brother operations, it’s a tax. Whether money is taken from you via your phone bill, your airline ticket, or your income, it’s a tax. If politicians can’t be honest about this, it’s time to go home. 
The TEA Party’s very acronym stands for “Taxed Enough Already.” We sent these politicians to Congress in an historic landslide election in 2010 with a mandate to stop the runaway spending train bankrupting our nation, not to wave to it from the station or – heaven forbid – increase its speed. And yet, here we are still pretending that there are no real world consequences to running up near trillion dollar deficits year after year with no end in sight.
So, where does this leave us? We can sit back and accept the increased spending “Compromised Plan” with increases in taxes and spending, or we can charge ahead to at least preserve the very modest Sequester cuts American workers already fought for. If we go with the first option, we simply kick the can down the road yet again and wait for the inevitable real world consequences of bankruptcy (see Detroit for an example of what’s in store). Or we can go with the second option and probably get clobbered by the media (so what’s new?!).
The Political Establishment will no doubt tell us that a budget battle will distract us from the fight against Obamacare. But that excuse is just the latest variation in the Establishment’s old canard that they’re keeping their powder dry for the next big battle which never seems to materialize because they’re always too busy waving the white flag and following the path of least resistance until election day.
Enough is enough!
Here’s the deal, folks. The media will clobber us no matter what. We do not want more taxes. We want Congress to rein in spending and live within its means. (What’s so radical about that?!) Americans have gotten quite an education recently in wasteful government spending as we’ve all seen how the federal government can blow a billion dollars on a website that doesn’t work. 
Do these members of Congress really think they can justify every tax dollar they spend and still demand more from hard working Americans by increasing our taxes?
2014 is just around the corner. If any member of Congress thinks raising taxes and increasing wasteful spending is a winning strategy to run on, then by all means they should vote for the Ryan budget. We’ll be watching."

Today, Ari Fleischer unintentionally admitted in public what we have long suspected: that he, and many conservatives like him, are sanctimonious, gluttonous fools motivated to good only by self-serving interests.
For here is his response today to the newly-struck ""fiscal cliff"" deal:



I increased donations to charity in 2012. This deal limits my deductions so I, & many others, will likely donate less in 2013.
— Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 1, 2013


Now, I don't know if he's correct about the deductions limits, and frankly, I don't care. Because at issue here is that Fleischer, in a moment of oblivious candor, admitted that he and ""many others"" like him will donate less to charity in the coming years. Why? Because it will no longer be in their financial interest to do so.
So much for empathy. So much for genuine compassion. So much for this: What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?
Not that any of this is surprising, for today we got plenty of reminders that empathy is not a Republican value. After all, just today Peter King (rabid Islamophobe) went apoplectic over Boehner's refusal to bring a Hurricane Sandy relief package up for a vote. Oh, and the House GOP allowed the 18-year-old Violence Against Women act to expire because ""the bill is too supportive of immigrants, the LGBT community, and Native Americans.""
Yes, we know callousness to be a contemporary Republican value. And Fleischer's Tweet merely admitted this fact.
However, he was appalled to have done so, for after pulling back the curtain today, Fleischer tried to yank it shut, tried to walk back what he had already revealed:



For those having a fit re my charity tweet, when gvt reduces ppl's take home pay, ppl have less $ to donate/spend. It's math

We're seeing the hypocrisy daily:  
The TX GOP Congressman berating a Federal Park ranger for the closure of a WWII memorial to visiting WWII veterans - a closure necessitated by his vote and those of his fellow Tea Baggers
The standing ovation in Congress for the Capitol Police force in the wake of their actions yesterday when a motorist tried to ram her way through a security barricade, even as that same Congress with its shutdown, results in those security personnel continuing to work but getting no paychecks.
Bureau of Labor Statistics....no jobs report.  Major portions of our nation's food industry essentially uninspected for food health and safety, National Guard troops unable to help Colorado communities recover from massive flooding and road closures as winter approaches.
But that didn't deter Fox News Business host Stuart Varney from letting everyone know his views about federal workers.
The details below the graphic picture of Varney's entrails:


Via Media Matters:
On the October 2 edition of AM 560's The Big John & Amy Show, co-hosts John Howell and Amy Jacobson interviewed Fox Business' Stuart Varney and asked him about the government shutdown and its effect on workers and the economy. Varney stated, incorrectly, that the shutdown was not having an impact on financial markets or the greater economy before launching into a tirade against federal employees.
HOWELL: Do you think that federal workers, when this ends, are deserving of their back pay or not?
VARNEY: That is a loaded question isn't it? You want my opinion? This is President Obama's shutdown. He is responsible for shutting this thing down; he's taken an entirely political decision here. No, I don't think they should get their back pay, frankly, I really don't. I'm sick and tired of a massive, bloated federal bureaucracy living on our backs, and taking money out of us, a lot more money than most of us earn in the private sector, then getting a furlough, and then getting their money back at the end of it. Sorry, I'm not for that. I want to punish these people. Sorry to say that, but that's what I want to do.
JACOBSON: But it's not their fault. It's not the federal employees' fault. I mean, that's what I'm sick of, I hate and it makes me anxious, to see people who are victimized because of a political fight.
VARNEY: I take your point Amy, it is not directly their fault, but I'm looking at the big picture here. I'm getting screwed. Here I am, a private citizen, paying an inordinate amount of money in tax. I've got a slow economy because it's all government, all the time. And these people are living on our backs, regulating us, telling us what to do, taxing us, taking our money, and living large. This is my chance to say ""hey, I'm fed up with this and I don't miss you when you're on furlough."" Sorry if that's a harsh tone, but that's the way I feel.

I am frankly at a loss for words.  Not since Rick Santelli launched his famous diatribe at the government bailout program on CNBC has a right-wing nutjob been so publicly and completely clueless, insensitive and ignorant as Mr. Varney.
Born in England in 1949, he came to the US in 1974.  He has worked for Fox, CNN and CNBC and lives in Franklin Lakes, NJ which, according to Wikipedia, has the 18th highest income of the state's  566 municipalities and 146th in Forbes listing of ""America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes"", with a median home price of $1,306,546
I am sure we can all understand the incredible pain and suffering Mr. Varney has had to endure living in these kinds of conditions and how much better off he would be if all federal and state workers simply quit their jobs to make his life happier.
There must be a special place in the Callousness Hall of Fame for Mr. Varney.  Perhaps Kossacks can suggest some fitting consequences for his brutal and totally uninformed diatribe.

Mitch McConnell on a crash course to crisis.

Republicans in the Senate have vowed to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by continuing to block confirmation of the agency's director, any director. It's not opposition to the individual, Richard Cordray, that is driving them. It's fealty to Wall Street and utter disregard for constitutional, governmental norms. Steve Benen talks about just how radical what the Senate Republicans are doing is.
What we're talking about here is a shrinking Senate minority pursuing a nullification strategy -- they want to nullify federal law by abusing procedural tactics in a way that's literally never been done in the United States.
If Senate Republicans want changes to the CFPB, there's already a mechanism in place that allows them to pursue reforms: it's called the existing legislative process. Senators can write a bill, send it to committee, try to persuade their colleagues of the proposal's merit, debate it on the floor, vote for it, etc.
But that takes time and effort, and it might not work, especially since the changes the GOP wants are absurd. So, instead, Republicans intend to block existing federal law from taking effect unless Democrats accept changes demanded by financial industry lobbyists.

As Benen says, it's nullification through extortion. They're demanding that federal law be ignored, unenforced, unless the changes to the CFPB they and their puppet-masters want are made. They are not doing this through the normal, regular, constitutional legislative process, but through an unprecedented filibuster. Just days after ostensibly agreeing with their votes for reform that the filibuster was being abused and, boy, they sure weren't going to do that anymore.
By systematically refusing to confirm President Obama's nominees, eschewing their constitutional advise and consent mandate, and by trying to force changes to existing law through extortion and exploiting Senate procedure, what the Senate Republicans are doing could indeed prompt a constitutional crisis. One alternative, and one that gets more attractive by the moment, is that Harry Reid goes ""nuclear,"" changing filibuster rules with a simple majority vote mid-session. In the face of such extreme Republican behavior, it might be the only rational response.
Please sign our petition urging Harry Reid to re-open the process of filibuster reform in the Senate.

Obama decides he doesn't need these guys for the next jobs effort.



Obama decides he doesn't need these guys for the next jobs effort.

In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama announced a new plan to repair the nation's failing infrastructure and create construction jobs. On Wednesday, the White House unveiled the plan.
The first element is a ""fix-it-first"" policy, an investment of $50 billion to address the transportation infrastructure with $40 billion of that targeted to the most urgent projects, the ""highways, bridges, transit systems, and airports most in need of repair."" The second part of the plan is a ""Rebuild America Partnership,"" with all levels of government partnering with business and private capital on infrastructure projects. The third part is a commitment from the federal government to modernize and streamline the agency permitting and regulatory processes for projects.
The outlines of the plan have been well received so far.
After hearing a general description of the proposal, Robert Puentes, director of theMetropolitan Infrastructure Initiative, said that while some of the announcement had been on the president’s agenda for some time, “the important shift seems to be the administration is not waiting for the legislature,” but is “maximizing the things they can do themselves.”
Mr. Puentes expressed enthusiasm for the infusion of more private capital into infrastructure investment. “This is not going to solve all our infrastructure problems — we still have a long way to go,” he said, adding that private money cannot meet all of the nation’s needs. However, he said, “this will go a long way.”

Importantly, these are initiatives that minimize the need for congressional approval, where there would likely be a less enthusiastic response, at least from one side. Past efforts at infrastructure jobs bills have regularly been killed by Republicans, whose commitment to real job creation is hollow, at best.

The fact that federal spending cuts were the primary factor driving today's grim economic growth report makes it clear that moving forward with the sequester's draconian spending cuts would be a complete disaster. This is not something that Republicans want to get blamed for, but unfortunately for House Speaker John Boehner, the only way he got House Republicans to agree to raise the debt limit was by promising to enforce the spending sequester. So now he's in a bit of a trap: He has to defend the sequester at the same time that he has to deny responsibility for it.
Here's how his office tried to accomplish that balancing act today:
""These arbitrary, automatic cuts were a creation and demand of the White House in 2011,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker of the House John Boehner in response to Carney's comments. ""Twice the House has passed legislation to replace them with common sense cuts and reforms. If there was any uncertainty late last year about the sequester, it was because the Democratic-controlled Senate, per usual, never lifted a finger to pass a plan to replace it.""
Actually, the truth is that the Senate has offered plenty of ways to achieve the same level of deficit reduction as the sequester—it's just that doing so would raise taxes, and Republicans refuse to do that. So it's not that the Senate hasn't lifted a finger, it's that House Republicans don't like the Senate's ideas.
Beyond that, however, there's no eternal rule that says the House couldn't just suspend the sequester indefinitely. The fact that they are insisting on equivalent cuts means that one way or another they are the ones insisting on the sequester.
Boehner's spokesman says the White House is the reason the sequester was created in the first place, back in 2011. But the truth is that Republicans were the ones pushing for the massive spending cuts—the president was trying to figure out how to keep the government running the face of GOP obstruction, and the sequester is what we ended up with.
That being said, what difference does it make who came up with the idea in 2011? It's 2013: What matters is what happens now. The GOP has within its power the ability to put aside the sequester—if it so chooses. If it doesn't, the most logical explanation is that John Boehner was telling the truth when he said this in August of 2011 after passing the debt ceiling deal that created the sequester in the first place:
When you look at this final agreement that we came to with the White House, I got 98 percent of what I wanted. I'm pretty happy.
Republicans created our fiscal nightmare. They can still fix it, or at least get out of the way, but the clock is ticking.

Ross Douthat thinks he knows who, and what, to blame for those darn Democrats in the White House, and the Senate, and for, well, you.
History is too contingent to say that had there been no Iraq invasion in 2003, there would be no Democratic majority in 2012. (It’s easy enough to imagine counterfactuals that might have put Hillary Clinton in the Oval Office.) But the Democratic majority that we do have is a majority that the Iraq war created: its energy and strategies, its leadership and policy goals, and even its cultural advantages were forged in the backlash against George W. Bush’s Middle East policies.
All those now-apologetic liberals who supported the war in 2003 are a big part of this story, because without their hawkishness there would have been no antiwar rebellion on the left — no Michael Moore and Howard Dean, no Daily Kos and all its “netroots” imitators.

So, according to Douthat, if Bush hadn't decided to kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis -- and thousands of American servicemen and women -- you wouldn't be here and President Obama would still be in the Illinois Senate.
You'll excuse me if I don't send Bush a thank you note.

Elisabeth Rosenthal looks at the difference between the potential of renewables and the path we're on.
We will need fossil fuels like oil and gas for the foreseeable future. So there’s really little choice (sigh). We have to press ahead with fracking for natural gas. We must approve the Keystone XL pipeline to get Canadian oil.
This mantra, repeated on TV ads and in political debates, is punctuated with a tinge of inevitability and regret. But, increasingly, scientific research and the experience of other countries should prompt us to ask: To what extent will we really “need” fossil fuel in the years to come? To what extent is it a choice? ...
“It’s absolutely not true that we need natural gas, coal or oil — we think it’s a myth,” said Mark Z. Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and the main author of the study, published in the journal Energy Policy. “You could power America with renewables from a technical and economic standpoint. The biggest obstacles are social and political — what you need is the will to do it.”

Kathleen Parker is apparently fixated on Hillary 2016, and thinks that you are, too.

Um, maybe in your home, Kathleen, but the rest of America kind of cares about what the current president is doing. Still, Parker does admit something that has to be tough for her to acknowledge.
Not incidentally, the women’s vote is hers. Even Republican women would find it hard not to cast a ballot for Hillary. If not her, then who?
Carl Hiaasen looks at a portion of government that's miraculously dodged the budget cuts.
Head Start education programs for low-income students are being slashed. So are medical services for 2 million native Americans living on Indian reservations and in Alaska.
The Army is suspending tuition assistance for soldiers hoping to enroll in classes, while scholarship funds have been curtailed for children of troops who were killed in combat. ...
Still, not everyone who depends on the federal government is suffering in these austere times.
According to the Wall Street Journal, the USDA is on the verge of purchasing 400,000 tons of sugar in a massive bailout of domestic sugar processors. The move would cost taxpayers about $80 million.

Maybe they're just too sweet to fail. Or maybe...
The major beneficiaries of this bailout would be cane growers in Florida and beet operations in Minnesota, Michigan and North Dakota. Big Sugar has outsized political clout in Washington, as evidenced by the silence of so-called fiscal conservatives.
Heavy campaign contributions are spread among Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama took money from the sugar industry, as did Mitt Romney. Hefty donations went to both of Florida’s senators, Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio.
Every time somebody in Congress tries to kill the sugar subsidy, the measure gets voted down — by some of the same lawmakers who love to rail against public spending on welfare benefits, health care and education.

Doyle McManus says that the sequester is showing up in more than just programs that help kids and soldiers.
Judging from the squeals we're hearing from members of Congress whose districts are threatened by cuts, the effects are intolerable.
The complaints from Democrats, who never wanted the sequester to go into effect, were predictable. But some of the complaining comes from Republicans who welcomed the sequester as an overdue act of belt-tightening.
Tea Party Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) has decried cuts to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which he called ""one of the few legitimate functions of government."" (The Johnson Space Center, with about 3,000 civilian employees, happens to be in his Houston-area district.) The sequester, Stockman warned, could put all Americans in danger — by hampering NASA's work to protect the Earth from asteroids.

But who really ""wins"" on the sequester is still an open question. Consider this your ""read it all"" political article of the morning.
Paul Krugman examines another small instance of the Rand-ification of the right.
On today’s right, not only is civic virtue, nay patriotism, associated with narrow defense of your own self-interest, any deviation from that standard — like being an affluent person who nonetheless supports aid to the poor paid for by progressive taxation — is considered prima facie hypocritical. …
All through the 2012 campaign we were lectured about the evils of “attacking success“, which was defined as any criticism of how a wealthy individual got that way. But as soon as they think they spot an opening, right-wingers go ahead and … attack success.

294,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/02/Obama-Administration-Decided-to-Block-Access-to-Memorials,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Obama Administration Decided to Block Access to Memorials,"

The Obama Administration has decided to block access to public memorials on the National Mall as a result of the government shutdown. Like its decision to end White House tours when the sequester cuts took effect, there is no rational reason for this. The Park Police, nominally in charge of monitoring these spaces, isn’t even affected by the shutdown. Shutting off access to these sites is gratuitous and petulant. 
On Monday, the first day of the government shutdown, a number of WWII veterans showed up at a memorial to their service to find that access had been blocked. The memorial is in a public space and is open 24/7, with almost no oversight from Park Police personnel. (Who, by the way, are exempt from the government shutdown.) The White House was, according to reports, informed of the veterans’ visit and chose to block access.
Having lived in DC for 18 years, I can tell you, the WWII Memorial is simply an architectural structure in an open public space. There is no official “access” to it. There are no guards. It’s a building in a park. Yet, the Obama Administration tried to block veterans from viewing the public memorial, even after hearing about the planned visit. 
Fortunately, the “greatest generation” was having nothing of this and easily overcame the government barricades. (Do we yet again have to rely on this generation to show the promise of America?) 
On Wednesday, the veterans’ group is planning to visit the Lincoln Memorial, which the Obama Administration has also vowed to close to visitors. I have regularly visited this memorial at one or two in the morning. At those hours, it is a peaceful and reflective place. It is an open space. There is no access that needs to be blocked. It is only by a conscious decision, and a great deal of work, that access would be blocked. 
This is nothing more than a petulant response by the Obama Administration to the government shutdown. Over the next week, more than 500 WWII veterans are expected in DC to visit the memorial dedicated to their sacrifice.

Former president Bill Clinton writes a must-share opinion piece calling for the overturn of the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act:
When I signed the bill, I included a statement with the admonition that “enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination.” Reading those words today, I know now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned.
We are still a young country, and many of our landmark civil rights decisions are fresh enough that the voices of their champions still echo, even as the world that preceded them becomes less and less familiar. We have yet to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, but a society that denied women the vote would seem to us now not unusual or old-fashioned but alien. I believe that in 2013 DOMA and opposition to marriage equality are vestiges of just such an unfamiliar society.

Paul Krugman of The New York Times looks at all the dire prediction of how President Barack Obama was going to destroy the economy:
the important point about these particular bad predictions is that they came from people who constantly invoke the potential wrath of the markets as a reason we must follow their policy advice. Don’t try to cover America’s uninsured, they told us; if you do, you will undermine business confidence and the stock market will tank. Don’t try to reform Wall Street, or even criticize its abuses; you’ll hurt the plutocrats’ feelings, and that will lead to plunging markets. Don’t try to fight unemployment with higher government spending; if you do, interest rates will skyrocket.
And, of course, do slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid right away, or the markets will punish you for your presumption.
By the way, I’m not just talking about the hard right; a fair number of self-proclaimed centrists play the same game. For example, two years ago, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson warned us to expect an attack of the bond vigilantes within, um, two years unless we adopted, you guessed it, Simpson-Bowles.
So what the bad predictions tell us is that we are, in effect, dealing with priests who demand human sacrifices to appease their angry gods — but who actually have no insight whatsoever into what those gods actually want, and are simply projecting their own preferences onto the alleged mind of the market.

Carl Hulse at The New York Times on the other filibuster:
In a vote just before Mr. Paul,  the junior senator from Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as director of central intelligence over drone policy, the Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia.
The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn’t blow up on Twitter the way Mr. Paul’s impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations — an issue that has torn the chamber for years.
Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.

Robert Nolan at U.S. News & World Report on the scars of the Iraq War:
Finally, while Sen. Rand Paul's filibustering speech on drones stole headlines regarding the vote for John Brennan to become the next director of the CIA this week, it's a Senate report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that could pose a greater problem for Brennan either now or early in his tenure. Though the report remains classified, The New York Times reports that Sen. John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, will push for at least parts of it to be made public. Insiders note the report offers a scathing criticism of CIA interrogation programs like those portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty revealing a pattern of failure to disclose details or grossly distorting the success of the program.
If Zero Dark Thirty's performance at the Oscars is any indication—it was nominated but failed to win in any major categories—the American public doesn't care much to discuss the uncomfortable lessons of our involvement in Iraq over the past decade. As always, we avoid them at our own peril. As the saying goes, those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it.

Ron Dzwonkowski at The Detroit Free Press has a great profile of Senator Carl Levin, who has announced that he won't run for another term:
Seemed like every time we met, Carl Levin was wearing the same suit -- not quite gray, not quite brown, always a little wrinkled. Add the ever-present plastic reading glasses on the end of his nose and a wild swirl of gray hair that covered less of his head every year, and this was either a carefully cultivated professorial image or a guy who had more important things on his mind than how he looked.
After just a few of the regular meetings we had during my years on the Free Press editorial page, I knew it was the latter. But that's not to say there wasn't some of the former in the mix.
In an era when politicians take courses in telegenics and sound bites, Carl Levin was pretty much ... Carl Levin, and that was apparently OK with the voters of Michigan, who elected and re-elected him six times to the U.S. Senate and would probably have given him a seventh term next year if Levin hadn't said Thursday that he's done running.

Brad Bannon on how the Republican Party's policies are anything but mainstream:
At the surrender ceremony after the British defeat at Yorktown in 1781, the British band played “The World Turned Upside Down.” Republicans, like the British, will realize that America has changed only after they lost the battle and the war. A new generation of selfless voters, the millennials have replaced the baby boomers as the focus of American politics but Republicans are stuck in a time warp in the 1980s. As the world changes, Republicans cling to the past as hard as Fox News hangs onto the myth that it is fair and balanced.

296,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/09/30/msnbc-halperin-media-bias-shutdown,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Halperin: Obama Okay with Shutdown Because Media Has His Back,"
Intentionally or not, Monday on Morning Joe, Time’s Mark Halperin revealed to the world how the American media’s pro-Obama bias will in part be to blame for any coming government shutdown. When asked if President Obama had an incentive to negotiate with the GOP, Halperin explained that, “The White House does not have much incentive. They think the trends are going to go in their direction at the end of the week, or early next week at the latest; because again, the press is largely sympathetic to their arguments on this.”
—

—
In short: The government is going to shut down because Obama knows the media has his back and therefore feels no pressure to enter into negotiations that might avert a shutdown. In fact, Obama is apparently okay letting the government shut down because he knows the media won’t make him pay a political price for it. 
So what we have here is the media’s pro-Obama bias as a big factor in a potential shutdown. 
As we have seen all year, when it comes to settled laws on issues such as gun control, voter ID, and immigration, the media are big believers in the kind of “civil bipartisan compromise” that results in changing those laws — as long as all that “civil bipartisan compromise” comes from the GOP. 
But the media have completely abandoned their championing of “civil bipartisan compromise” with respect to this budget crisis, and as a result, Obama knows he has the media on his side and is therefore comfortable in his position not to negotiate. And Obama’s refusal to compromise is hurtling America towards a government shutdown. 
What we have here is a situation wherein media bias is helping to inflame a crisis. In other words, were the media acting responsibly, objectively,  and professionallly, this would actually decrease the chances of a shutdown. Obviously, though, the media wants its cake and to eat it too. The media are behaving in a way that increases the chances of a shutdown and then the media will blame the GOP for what the media helped cause.  
Now we also know why Obama felt so secure golfing during this weekend’s shutdown crisis, instead of rolling up his sleeves like a leader to make a deal. Why not? He knows the media won’t blame him for anything, including shutting down the government.

One day after New York Times columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman described Republican brinksmanship on the debt ceiling as ""hostage-taking,"" President Obama used his Monday press conference to declare, ""They will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy."" But you don't have to take their word for it that the GOP is holding the U.S. economy captive with its unprecedented refusal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. Just listen to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who in August 2011 crowed that the debt ceiling is ""a hostage that's worth ransoming.""
Nevertheless, the kamikaze conservatives who would sink the American ship of state if their demands for draconian spending cuts are not met are pretending that Republican willingness to trigger the first-ever U.S. default is no different than past no votes of individual Democratic senators. But as the likes of Karl Rove and Byron York well know, in 2004 and 2006 Republicans had a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Put another way, Democrats not only didn't threaten to block a debt ceiling increase, they didn't have the numbers to do it.
Of course, you wouldn't know that by reading the recent screeds of Karl Rove:
""There may be no person in America with less moral authority than Mr. Obama on this issue. Six years ago he led a Democratic effort to defeat a $781 billion debt-ceiling increase.""
On Saturday, Rove's reliable water-carrier Byron York echoed the same point about that 2006 debt limit hike. ""Declaring themselves outraged by such spending, Reid, Durbin, Schumer, and Murray all voted against raising the debt limit. So did every other Democrat—including Sen. Barack Obama."" York went on to note:
In the summer of 2011, during the last debt ceiling fight, Reid conceded his '06 vote was all about politics. ""I shouldn't have done that,"" he told ABC's Jonathan Karl. ""I'm kind of embarrassed I did. It was a political maneuver by we Democrats.""
But York left out Reid's next sentence from that ABC interview:
""The Republicans were in power - there were more of them.""
And that difference makes all the difference.
(Continue reading below the fold.)


Republicans in 2006 enjoyed majorities in both the House (232-203) and the Senate (55-45). As Reid rightly pointed out, ""The Republicans were in power—there were more of them."" To be sure, Democrats were trying to score political points at President Bush's expense. But there were no threats, no filibusters and no risk to the full faith and credit of the United States.
Which is what makes the GOP's hostage-taking so unique. Whether motivated by opposition to larger spending or tax legislation, or as a symbolic vote to embarrass the president and his Congressional majority (as Sens. Obama and Reid did in 2006), the 40 debt ceiling increases since 1980 have rarely been unanimous. But never before has the threat to block a debt limit increase been coupled with one party's intent and ability to actually do it. After all, while Republican Speaker John Boehner has the numbers to deny a debt ceiling increase in the House, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell can prevent it from even coming to a vote. Of course, when George W. Bush sat in the Oval Office, GOP leaders including Boehner, McConnell, Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor and John Cornyn didn't just vote for seven increases in the debt ceiling. In November 2004, they all voted for the very kind of ""clean"" debt ceiling bill they refuse to offer President Obama now.
After having increases the national debt by 40 percent since his inauguration in January 2001, President George W. Bush in October 2004 called for his fourth hike in the nation's borrowing authority. His Treasury Secretary John Snow warned, ""Given current projections, it is imperative that the Congress take action to increase the debt limit by mid-November,"" adding that his arsenal of fiscal tools, including tapping money intended for the civil service retirement fund, ""will be exhausted.""
But as the New York Times explained on November 17, 2004, Bush had to wait for his debt ceiling increase for a very simple reason:
Though an increase in the debt ceiling was never in doubt, Republican leaders in both houses of Congress postponed action on it last month, until after the elections, to deprive Democrats of a chance to accuse them of fiscal irresponsibility.

With his reelection safely secured, Republicans delivered Bush's debt ceiling increase in a stand-alone bill, with no conditions, no threats and no poison pills. By 52-44 in the Senate and 208-204 in the House, Republicans led Sen. Bill Frist (R-TN) and Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) boosted the borrowing limit from $7.4 trillion to $8.2 trillion. Over 100 current Republican members of Congress voted ""aye."" Among them were the today's top two Senate Republicans (Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn) and the entire House leadership team (Boehner, Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan).

And just why did President Bush and his allies insist that 11 percent increase was needed?
Administration officials contend that the annual deficits are undesirable but necessary to help stimulate an economic recovery and fight a global war on terrorism.
As Speaker Hastert's spokesman John Feehery put it just before the House vote:
""We have an obligation to keep the government in operation.""
In their rare moments of candor, Republican leaders acknowledge as much. Failure to raise the debt limit, Speaker John Boehner cautioned in January 2011, ""would be a financial disaster, not only for our country but for the worldwide economy."" Paul Ryan, whose 2012 House GOP budget would add $6 trillion in new red ink over the next decade, agreed that ""you can't not raise the debt ceiling."" Lindsey Graham, who has repeatedly demanded Obama ""man up"" on spending cuts, explained why:
""Let me tell you what's involved if we don't lift the debt ceiling: financial collapse and calamity throughout the world. That's not lost upon me. But we've done this 93 times. And if we keep doing the same old thing, then that is insanity to the nth degree.""
Apparently, that ""same old thing"" doesn't apply when a Republican is sitting in the Oval Office. It's not just that Ronald Reagan presided over 17 debt limit hikes and a tripling of the national debt during his eight years in the White House or that President George W. Bush nearly doubled it again. The end-of-decade $5.6 trillion surplus forecast by the Congressional Budget Office in 2000 was more than eviscerated by two unfunded wars, two rounds of Bush tax cuts, the unpaid-for Medicare prescription drug benefit and the TARP bank bailout. To accommodate those ""spend and not tax"" policies, Bush and his GOP allies in Congress voted seven times to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. (That vote tally included a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase in 2004, backed by 98 current House Republicans and 31 sitting GOP senators.) And as it turns out, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) voted for all of it.

During the GOP's first debt ceiling hostage-taking in the summer of 2011, U.S. consumer confidence plunged and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost while Uncle Sam racked up almost $2 billion in unnecessary interest payments. As for the uncertainty and credit rating downgrade the debt ceiling debacle produced, S&P pointed the finger at the GOP, the only party willing to countenance a default by the United States:
A Standard & Poor's director said for the first time Thursday that one reason the United States lost its triple-A credit rating was that several lawmakers expressed skepticism about the serious consequences of a credit default -- a position put forth by some Republicans. Without specifically mentioning Republicans, S&P senior director Joydeep Mukherji said the stability and effectiveness of American political institutions were undermined by the fact that ""people in the political arena were even talking about a potential default,"" Mukherji said. ""That a country even has such voices, albeit a minority, is something notable,"" he added. ""This kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns.""

That's exactly right. That kind of rhetoric is not common amongst AAA sovereigns and unheard of among Democrats. But among Republican leaders, holding the American economy hostage is just another day at the office. After his first round of debt limit extortion, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell boasted in August 2011:
""I think some of our members may have thought the default issue was a hostage you might take a chance at shooting,"" he said. ""Most of us didn't think that. What we did learn is this -- it's a hostage that's worth ransoming. And it focuses the Congress on something that must be done.""
And as he later explained to CNBC's Larry Kudlow, McConnell's future hostage-taking isn't a threat, but a promise:
""What we have done, Larry, also is set a new template. In the future, any president, this one or another one, when they request us to raise the debt ceiling, it will not be clean anymore. This is just the first step. This, we anticipate, will take us into 2013. Whoever the new president is, is probably going to be asking us to raise the debt ceiling again. Then we will go through the process again and see what we can continue to achieve in connection with these debt ceiling requests of presidents to get our financial house in order.""
A new template, indeed. Because while the minority party in Congress has often voted against debt ceiling increases, it never had the either the numbers or the intent to blackmail the president. Until, that is, Democrat Barack Obama entered the Oval Office.

President Obama is expected to ignore calls from the American people to cut spending in his State of the Union speech. It appears that he will urge the government to spend more, while using euphemisms such as “investments” to obfuscate the issue. The speech will likely focus on “investments” in infrastructure and education.
White House economic adviser Gene Sperling warned that closing the deficit “doesn’t mean you pull back on everything … I don’t think that laying the foundation for future growth (with research and highway spending) is anything to discount in any way. What you need to do is be smart.”
White House press secretary Jay Carney opined, “The core emphasis that he has always placed in these big speeches remains the same, and it will remain the same — the need to make the economy work for the middle class.” He added that the State of the Union address will speak of “proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and to help the economy grow.” 
Obama, as usual, is proceeding with his plans despite polls showing they are unpopular.
Last week a poll by Fox News revealed 73 percent of voters believed cutting spending was the best approach to fixing the U.S. economy, while only 15 percent who favored  increased spending. Two out of three people surveyed were against another “economic stimulus.”
A new Pew poll indicated that the budget deficit was now the third most important issue concerning Americans, surpassing terrorism and just behind the economy and jobs. According to the Commerce Department, the last quarter of 2012 featured the economy shrinking by .1 percent.
The difference between Obama and the GOP, which favors cutting spending without raising spending, can be summed up in two quotes: former Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter saying that cuts in spending alone would “strangle our economy,” and Noelle Clemente, with the American Action Forum, asserting that the claims by the White house of cuts they have made are “full of budget gimmicks …We’ve seen that stimulus spending doesn’t work. That’s not the solution. … We know that this is a long-term spending problem and it’s driven by long-term spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.”

At 8.8 percent, the official unemployment rate in North Carolina is the fifth highest in the nation, with only Nevada, Illinois, Mississippi and Rhode Island worse off. As elsewhere across America, that figure doesn't fully measure the misery of the state's economic situation.
But as of this weekend, the situation is going to get a lot worse for about 70,000 out-of-work residents. Having bought into the cries for austerity, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory and the legislature made it a priority to slash unemployment compensation in February. As a result, North Carolina will be the first to lose a lifeline for the long-term unemployed—the Federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program.
That 100 percent federally funded program was enacted because of the Great Recession. It extended the period of time jobless Americans could collect compensation checks to as much as 99 weeks in the worst-hit states. Nationwide, 1.7 million Americans still receive compensation under the EUC. Unless Congress acts, which seems highly unlikely, the entire program expires Dec. 31 this year. But North Carolina is bailing six months early.
The reason North Carolinians will no longer be covered under the federal program is because the legislature cut maximum compensation of the state unemployment program to $350 a week. Under the provisions of the EUC, no such cuts are allowed without a federal waiver, which North Carolina did not obtain.
The stated rationale behind the cuts? North Carolina owes the federal government $2.1 billion it borrowed to cover payments when it ran out of money in the state compensation fund because of the severity of the recession. The goal is to pay off that debt by 2015. Nineteen other states also borrowed money from the feds to cover holes in their compensation funds.
Altogether, between now and 2017, the North Carolina legislature's fiscal research office says, the state will save $3.6 billion from compensation cuts and an additional charge to businesses of $42 a year for each employee. Of the total, 74 percent of the savings will come from cuts in worker compensation.
Not only did the legislature whack how much an eligible jobless person can collect each week—the average is $292.60—it also cut how long a person can collect payments to 20 weeks from the 26 weeks every state has provided compensation for the past half-century. If the unemployment rate falls far enough in North Carolina, the maximum compensation period will be reduced to just 12 weeks, the lowest in the nation.
The package of cuts was originally the work of the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce, the state's main business lobby.
Please continue reading about the situation in North Carolina below the fold.


So, in two days, those eligible for compensation in North Carolina can collect a maximum weekly payment of $350 for a maximum of 20 weeks.
Then nothing.
For comparison, New Jersey, whose official jobless rate at 8.6 percent is just barely under North Carolina's—and also owes the feds money it borrowed because heavy, long-term unemployment had drained its compensation fund—the maximum weekly check is $624 for 26 weeks from the state fund and 47 weeks from the federal EUC.
In the Tar Heel State, it's going to be grim going for those 70,000:
Wayne Bostick, 58, of Raleigh, said he lost his job in April 2011 and will lose extended federal benefits immediately. He said he earned about $700 a week in take-home pay, often working double shifts at a ConAgra Foods plant until it shut down after a fatal explosion. Since then, he said, the only jobs he’s found matching his skills pay less than $10 an hour and are outside Raleigh. Now he’ll have to revisit those or start a handyman business.
“I’d rather do that than bring home $200” after commuting and taxes, he said. “They are really putting the gun to your head now.”

But to the state's lawmakers, the plight of Bostick and 70,000 other out-of-work citizens makes no never-mind.

During his Monday press conference, Barack Obama bizarrely claimed he needs to raise the debt ceiling because Congress won’t stop ordering him to spend money:
This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: ‘You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.’ They lay all this out for me, and–because they have the spending power–and so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.
Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.
Of course, Obama isn’t mentioning that it is largely his side that wants to spend, while the GOP wants to cut spending. 
The issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation and so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills. Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happy to take it.
If they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done and you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending.
The president’s entire defense is predicated on the premise that spending absolutely must stay at its current levels, an issue he has been entirely unwilling to discuss with Republicans in Congress.
Notice that for the past two years, the House, run by the GOP, has passed budgets while the Democratic Senate hasn’t. Who’s the fiscally irresponsible party here?"

The sequester brings a lot of big, damaging cuts to government programs and services. The problem is, if Republicans get anything close to their way—and remember, it's Democrats they're bargaining with, so there's a good chance Republicans do get much of what they want—the solution could be as bad as the problem of sequestration. Social Security and Medicaid aren't sequestered. But cutting those programs has been on the Republican wish list for a long time, and will be one of their demands.
The question is how hard Democrats will fight to protect the programs that seniors rely on and that give non-seniors the promise of being able to retire without living in abject poverty.
""The president has made one of his bottom lines that significant revenues have to be on the table,"" said Chuck Loveless, the director of legislation for AFSCME, a major public services employees union. ""If he sticks to his guns on that I'm not worried, but chained CPI is on his shortlist. We oppose that, and it is a significant cut to social security.""
It should go without saying that if Democrats agree to cut Social Security benefits, even at the insistence of Republicans, come 2014 and 2016, Republicans will wage campaign attacks against Democrats for having cut Social Security. But with Republicans so insistent, and a few Democrats wobbly on the issue, New York Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler says that ""If you go in and decide to fix sequestration, how much longer can you exempt entitlements. It's difficult to do if you want to get bipartisan agreement.""
This is the fight. Can Republicans protect tax subsidies for oil companies by cutting Social Security benefits for seniors? Are Democrats going to make that deal? If Americans don't want Social Security cut—and they don't, even if politicians are calling it ""chained CPI"" and pretending it's not really a cut—that needs to be crystal clear to Congress and the president.
Tell Congress it's time to end tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy.

Obama’s Debt Default Is on His Shoulders While We Shoulder His Impeachable Offenses
Apparently the president thinks he can furlough reality when talking about the debt limit. To suggest that raising the debt limit doesn’t incur more debt is laughably absurd. The very reason why you raise the debt limit is so that you can incur more debt. Otherwise what’s the point?
It’s also shameful to see him scaremongering the markets with his talk of default. There is no way we can default if we follow the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment, Section 4, requires that we service our debt first. We currently collect more than enough tax revenue to service our debt if we do that first. However, we don’t have enough money to continue to finance our ever-growing federal government (with our $17 trillion dollar national debt that has increased over 50% since Obama took office). That’s why President Obama wants to increase the debt limit. He doesn’t want to make the tough decisions to rein in government spending. So, he’s scaremongering the markets about default, just as he tries to scaremonger our senior citizens about their Social Security, which, by the way, is funded by the Social Security Trust Fund and is solvent through 2038.
It’s time for the president to be honest with the American people for a change. Defaulting on our national debt is an impeachable offense, and any attempt by President Obama to unilaterally raise the debt limit without Congress is also an impeachable offense. A default would also be a shameful lack of leadership, just as mindlessly increasing our debt without trying to rein in spending is a betrayal of our children and grandchildren who will be stuck with the bill.

Moment of realization

Florida Gov. Rick Scott, you are a dumbass. Sorry, but there's really no other professional political way to put it. It looks once again like a group of austerity-obsessed Republicans have suddenly discovered a pressing new need for some of those parts of government they decided they didn't want to pay for. Specifically, the part they suddenly discover personally affects them:
With Tropical Storm Chantal headed for South Florida with landfall likely Saturday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott is sounding alarm bells about the impact of National Guard furloughs on state storm preparations. “The problem is you’re losing training time, you’re losing preparation time,” Scott said during a radio interview in Jacksonville. “When will the National Guard make the decision that we stop the furloughs? Right after the hurricane hits?”
Mr. Scott, I have it on very good authority that the National Guard has been implementing furloughs because Republicans insisted they not be paid enough to avoid furloughs. It was called sequestration and it was in all the papers. You may have heard of it.
Scott joined with two other Southern Republican governors whose states are in the path of tropical storms to write a letter to President Obama urging him to call off the furloughs. In Florida, nearly 1,000 employees of the National Guard are furloughed once a week, saving the federal government money under the congressionally mandated sequester but costing the state in readiness.
One of those two other Southern Republican governors is of course Bobby Jindal, most famous for being pissed off at something called ""volcano monitoring"" because his state doesn't have volcanos, but a firm believer in ""hurricane monitoring"" because Bobby Jindal only believes in things he can see out his window. It isn't so much an ideological conviction for him as it is pure self-centeredness, self-centeredness above and beyond that of the usual Republican wag.
So that's great, you're sending a letter off to President Obama saying you're very very peeved about the congressionally mandated requirement that members of the National Guard be furloughed because Republicans have insisted not just on implementing what all parties agreed at the beginning was the Stupidest Possible Way to cut spending, but are now insisting that we not actually fix because Congress is literally simply too incompetent to pass any better idea. You know who would be a better person to complain to than President Obama? The damn Republicans who insist on the furloughs. The people who put the ""mandate"" in the ""congressional mandate"" part. You even have their numbers, it wouldn't be a hard call.
Unless, of course, this isn't actually about avoiding potentially dangerous cuts to government safety programs, but about moving money around (the executive branch can't do a whole lot of that either, by the way) so as to screw somebody else in order to reverse only the cuts to government safety that affect you, and your state, and the people who will have your head on a plastic cafeteria tray if you screw things up. Because that wouldn't just be stupid, that'd make you kind of a bastard.
My lingering suspicion has long been that the House, crippled by their own ideological schisms, incompetence and eff-it-all approach to government, will never be able to actually pass any legislation that removes the need for government-wide furloughs, program cancellations, and other drastic measures. They'll just go through the entire roster of government duties one-by-one, refunding each and every thing a week after the cut to that thing resulted in either a minor fiasco or an outright disaster, and only when the fiascos or outright disasters are things they can personally see out their office windows. That seems to be the case—though if we count recent House Republican reactions to natural disasters not in their own states but merely in other Republican-led states, even that might might be expecting too much of them.

White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, who controversially told journalist Bob Woodward he would “regret” accusing the Obama administration of shifting the goalposts to include tax hikes in debate over the sequester, offered a misleading defense of the sequester on CNN’s State of the Union with Candy Crowley on Sunday.
Sperling told Crowley that the original intent of the sequester was “to force both sides to come back to the type of grand bargain that Bowles-Simpson have called for, that most budget experts call for…”. 
But President Barack Obama rejected the recommendations of the Bowles-Simpson commission, even though he had established it to propose solutions to the country’s long-term budget crisis. 
As Woodward recalled in The Price of Politics, and as is easily confirmed by a variety of other sources, including former Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner, Obama rejected the Bowles-Simpson formula because he was not willing to accept reforms to the country’s entitlements, including Social Security. 
Obama and the Democrats wanted larger tax hikes and fewer cuts to spending and entitlements. Many Republicans, too, rejected the plan, largely because it left the massive new entitlement of Obamacare in place.
Moreover, as Woodward pointed out elsewhere in the book (and as Breitbart News highlighted long before Woodward’s claims about the sequester made him a White House target), it was Obama himself who scuttled a “grand bargain” by demanding additional revenues through tax hikes when a deal had been within reach.
Sperling’s revisionist history invites the question: if the sequester had been meant to encourage a grand bargain like Bowles-Simpson, why hasn’t Obama simply embraced Bowles-Simpson?
The obvious answer is that Obama had no intention of reaching a deal, and hoped to use the sequester as he used the “fiscal cliff”–to squeeze more concessions out of Republicans on tax rates, and to blame the opposition for whatever horrible economic outcomes the administration could conjure. "

The performance of the White House Press Corps during President Obama’s Tuesday afternoon briefing resulted in not a single question that seriously challenged the president or even made him uncomfortable. The hour-long affair was more like a conversation between the like-minded on issues such as the ongoing budget battles and going around Congress by raising the debt ceiling by executive fiat. Anyone who remembers the non-stop confrontation directed at President Bush just a few years ago, by this same group of reporters, would not recognize them today.  
Not a single reporter confronted Obama over the violent rhetoric he and his administration have been using to describe Republicans, or even the fact that as a Senator, Obama voted against raising the debt ceiling — a position he is now describing as dangerous, irresponsible and akin to hostage-taking. 
In fact, in this briefing, Obama used the words “hostage, insane, ransom, nuclear bomb, chaos, disaster.”
Mark Knoller of CBS News is the only reporter that asked the president about the individual compromise spending bills the GOP have passed to fund the parks, veterans, and National Institutes of Health, among other items. Obama swatted away the question with talking points without being challenged on the fact that this veto threat means children suffering from cancer will not get treatment from the NIH.
No reporter even asked about the ObamaCare launch debacle. 
Here are some of the questions that were asked:
— 
Julie Pace of AP
 Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Obviously if Congress does pass a clean CR and a clean debt ceiling bill, those may just be short-term measures. If that happens, does your offer to negotiate with them on issues like health care and spending and deficit reduction still stand in the intervening weeks if they pass measures that are just perhaps six weeks or two months long? 
—
Julianna Goldman.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You laid out the economic consequences of default, but if we were to get to that point, would you prioritize and pay bondholders first to maintain the semblance of credit or — rather than Social Security recipients or military servicemen and women? And how would you go ahead and make that determination?
— 
Sam Stein, Huffington Post.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. With Speaker Boehner so far unwilling to hold a vote on a clean CR, what assurances can you give to those affected by a shutdown who are concerned about an even longer impasse? And how worried are you personally that your preferred solution to this clean CR and sequestration levels may do harm to the nation’s economy and your second-term agenda?
— 
Roberta Rampton.
Q: Thanks. You talked a bit about the hit to credibility around the world that this impasse has caused. I’m wondering what you and your administration are telling worried foreign creditors, China and Japan, who are calling and then asking about whether the United States is going to avoid defaulting on its debts?
—
Ari Shapiro.
Q: Thank you, Mr. President. You mentioned the Supreme Court, and the term started today with a campaign finance case that sort of picks up where Citizens United left off. You called Citizens United devastating to the public interest, so I wonder if you could weigh in on this latest case.
—
Respected members of the media also described the performance of their colleagues in the press corps as “pathetic.”

306,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/08/1260564/-Republicans-chicken-out-on-tax-reform,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,Republicans chicken out on tax reform,"


For three years, ""tax reform"" has been the centerpiece of the Republican Party's program for the American economy. Ever since taking control of the House, GOP leaders have promised that ""lowering rates"" while ""broadening the base"" would produce ""revenue-neutral"" tax reform. In 2011, 2012 and again in 2013, 95 percent of congressional Republicans voted for the Paul Ryan House GOP budget establishing just two tax brackets at 10 and 25 percent, while promising to recoup hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue annually by closing some of the tax breaks that now cost Uncle Sam about $1.2 trillion a year. ""We won't duck the tough issues,"" Mitt Romney's newly anointed running mate Paul Ryan told voters in August 2012, ""We will lead.""
As it turns out, ducking the tough issues is exactly what Ryan and his GOP colleagues in Congress have done. After three years of refusing to name a single tax expenditure or deduction they would curb or close, Republicans are chickening out on tax reform altogether.
That's the word from Politico, which reported this week that House Republicans have put the tax reform proposals of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) on ice. Seven months after they threatened to tie any debt ceiling increase to tax reform and five months after Camp promised them 50 years of secrecy for any loopholes they'd suggest for closure, Paul Ryan and his Republican allies have decided discretion is the better part of valor:
House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and others pulled the plug last month on Camp's long-standing vow to take up a tax overhaul bill this year, putting his three-year quest in limbo. The reversal shows how support for tax reform, even among Republicans, is broad but not deep. They routinely say they want to overhaul the Tax Code, but when the Michigan Republican pushed to take the first big step -- putting out a bill -- party leaders blinked.
They blinked because the math is hard—and the politics even worse.
Here's why. While repealing Obamacare, slashing Medicaid funding by a third and leaving roughly 38 million more people uninsured, the Ryan budget still runs up trillions in new red ink thanks to its massive tax cut windfall for the wealthy. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Ryan's plan to reduce the top tax rate from 39.6 to 25 percent, to shift from seven income brackets to two (10 and 25 percent), to cut the corporate tax from 35 to 25 percent and other changes will cost Uncle Sam $5.7 trillion over the next 10 years. In March, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) forecast that Ryan's payday for the gilded class would slash the average tax bill for millionaires by $330,000 (15.4 percent) a year.
Read more about tax reform below the fold.



As TPC's Howard Gleckman explained the numbers:
The tax cuts described in Ryan's budget would generate a huge windfall for high-income taxpayers. On average, households would get a cut of $3,000. But those in the top 0.1 percent of income, who make $3.3 million or more, would get a whopping $1.2 million on average-a 20 percent increase in their after-tax income.
To put it another way, each of the Ryan budget budgets backed by House and Senate Republicans over the last three years inevitably will produce both oceans of red ink and a Treasury-draining payday for the rich. Unless, that is, Republicans can identify which tax breaks and loopholes they would limit or end to prevent those two certainties from coming to pass.
And from the beginning, that's precisely what they've been too cowardly to do.

As the Washington Post showed (chart above), the trillion-plus dollars in annual tax expenditures is now larger than Uncle Sam's take from the income tax each year. Much of the estimated $1.3 trillion in annual tax expenditures in 2015 (a figure almost double the size of the last fiscal year's budget deficit) benefits working and middle income Americans. For example, the home mortgage interest deduction was worth $89 billion in 2011. Tax-deferred 401K accounts cost the Treasury $63 billion that same year. The Earned Income Tax Credit had a similar price tag. It's no wonder, as the Post concluded, ""ever-increasing tax breaks for U.S. families eclipse benefits for special interests.""

So which ones would John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and company curb or close?  We're still waiting for an answer.
Matthew Yglesias mocked the dodge at the center of Ryan's 2012 budget, the same one he used before and since:
Thirteen pages dedicated to explaining his vision for revenue-neutral tax reform. And even so he manages to not name a single tax deduction that he's planning to eliminate. Home mortgage interest deduction? I dunno. Electric vehicle tax credit? I dunno. Deductibility of state and local income taxes? I dunno.
That same month, Paul Krugman tried to decipher which deductions and tax breaks are actually in the mystery meat that is Paul Ryan's budgetary dog food. As he explained in ""Pink Slime Economics"":
We're talking about a lot of loophole-closing. As Howard Gleckman of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center points out, to make his numbers work Mr. Ryan would, by 2022, have to close enough loopholes to yield an extra $700 billion in revenue every year. That's a lot of money, even in an economy as big as ours. So which specific loopholes has Mr. Ryan, who issued a 98-page manifesto on behalf of his budget, said he would close?
None. Not one. He has, however, categorically ruled out any move to close the major loophole that benefits the rich, namely the ultra-low tax rates on income from capital. (That's the loophole that lets Mitt Romney pay only 14 percent of his income in taxes, a lower tax rate than that faced by many middle-class families.)


Appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe on March 20, 2012, Congressman Ryan declared he would ""get rid of the special interest loopholes, special deductions, lower everybody's tax rates, bring in at least as much revenue to the government but grow the economy and create jobs, and get spending under control so we can pay off this debt."" But when host Joe Scarborough asked, ""Which one of those [loopholes] do you eliminate,"" Ryan decided to duck and cover:
""We want to do this in the light of day and in front of everybody. So the Ways and Means Committee, which is in charge of the tax system, sent us the plan here, which is a 10 and 25 percent bracket for individuals and small businesses, and then they want to have hearings and, in light of day, show how they would go about doing this.""
Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation just days later, Ryan again claimed that ""We're proposing to keep revenues where they are, but to clear up all the special interest loopholes, which are uniquely enjoyed by higher income earners, in exchange for lower rates for everyone."" But he once again pleaded the Fifth when asked which ""special interest loopholes"" he would do away with:
""That's what the Ways & Means Committee is supposed to do. That's not the job of the Budget Committee,"" Ryan said on Fox News Sunday. ""What we're saying is, we want to do this in the light of day, not in some backroom deal. We want to have hearings in the Ways & Means Committee that Chairman Dave Camp has already started that work, to say what tax benefits should go.""
Almost two years later, Camp won't publicly say what tax benefits would go, either. As McClatchy reported in June on the progress he and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) had made:
Both chairmen refused to say what they supported or what tax loopholes they'd propose closing. Camp focused instead on areas of agreement.
""There are so many good (tax) simplification policies that we agree on,"" he said.
Asked whether they'll propose limiting the mortgage-interest deduction that homeowners now enjoy, Camp acknowledged that two-thirds of Americans don't itemize their federal taxes and said that perhaps a complete rethink was in order.

A complete rethink, indeed. During the 2012 campaign, Paul Ryan's running mate Mitt Romney similarly called for closing tax loopholes to offset his huge tax cuts for the wealthy. For months, Mitt Romney had performing the same trick as Ryan, promising only that the ""1 percent keeps paying the current share they're paying or more."" His economic adviser Glenn Hubbard even confirmed Romney's cowardice, explaining ""it is not his intention to take on any specific deduction or exclusion and eliminate it.""
Unfortunately for the Republican ticket, nonpartisan analysts trying to model Romney's proposals did. And the picture they painted wasn't a pretty one. Even after assuming the closure of tax loopholes and deductions which disproportionately favor the rich, the Tax Policy Center forecast that President Romney would end up cutting  taxes for the richest five percent of earners while increasing the tax bill for the other 95 percent of Americans. It's no wonder Ezra Klein concluded that ""'broadening the base and lowering the rates' is anti-family tax reform,"" adding:
""The size of the tax cut he's proposing for the rich is larger than all of the tax expenditures that go to the rich put together. As such, it is mathematically impossible for him to keep his promise to make sure the top one percent keeps paying the same or more.""
Romney stuck to his line, assuring voters those gains for the gilded class weren't true because no one could predict what his plan would do. During an appearance on CNBC, he went for the full ostrich:
""So I haven't laid out all of the details about how we're going to deal with each deduction, so I think it's kind of interesting for the groups to try and score it, because frankly it can't be scored, because those kinds of details will have to be worked out with Congress, and we have a wide array of options.""
In response, the Post's Klein could only shake his head:
""Let's be clear on this: A tax plan that can't be scored because it doesn't include sufficient details is not a plan. It's a gesture towards a plan, or a statement of intended direction, or perhaps an unusually wonky daydream. But it's not a plan.""
It's certainly not plan, but instead a fraud. Yet just days after Barack Obama vanquished his Republican opponent, Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt suggested the president make the Republican scam his own. ""Look at ways to increase revenue by one growing the economy,"" he said on Fox News. ""And two, maybe look at the tax code, just like Governor Romney suggested, you look at the tax code and increase revenue without increasing taxes."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor agreed:
""What would be best is a fundamental reform of the tax code that lowers rates, broadens the base, makes America's business competitive again, and reduces the burden imposed by taxes on work and investment.""
But by September, Cantor didn't even include tax reform in his list of priorities for House Republicans. As for Paul Ryan, next week he has a compromise budget proposal to work on with Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, a task he must complete to avoid another embarrassing government shutdown for the GOP. And after that, he has a 2016 presidential campaign to contemplate. All of which means the Republicans' three-year tax reform scheme is, at best, on the backburner. As Politico concluded, Camp and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan did not make it any easier on themselves:
Lawmakers had no idea how they'd make the math work. It would be a mammoth task, forcing them to dig into big, popular middle-class tax breaks.
Or, to put it another way, tax reform is dead. Long live tax reform.

307,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/04/05/1199372/-Krugman-The-Urge-to-Purge,Opinion,Dailykos,Republican,"Krugman: ""The Urge to Purge""","

This column is the Nobel Laureate's detailed explanation of why David Stockman is wrong in what Krugman calls ""a mammoth screed,"" the former Reagan Budget director's “The Great Deformation.”
Krugman begins by reminding us that when the Great Depression struck,
When the Great Depression struck, many influential people argued that the government shouldn’t even try to limit the damage.
 Among these were Herbert Hoover's Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, whom he quotes as opining that the President
“Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers. ... It will purge the rottenness out of the system.”
He also quotes Joseph Schumpeter, and then writes
Like many economists, I used to quote these past luminaries with a certain smugness. After all, modern macroeconomics had shown how wrong they were, and we wouldn’t repeat the mistakes of the 1930s, would we?
How naïve we were. It turns out that the urge to purge — the urge to see depression as a necessary and somehow even desirable punishment for past sins, while inveighing against any attempt to mitigate suffering — is as strong as ever. Indeed, Mellonism is everywhere these days.

the urge to purge - somehow when I read the title I immediately thought not of some bulemic, because that would at least carry with it the notion of having eaten well, which is not true of the ordinary American who is being crushed by what has happened in the economy and will be crushed even more by the proposed austerity, but rather of some medieval doctor further weakening the patient by ""blood-letting"" from an already sick man.  So it is with the approach of the austerity mavens with respect to our economy.



Krugman reminds us that those insisting upon austerity have been wrong at every stage of our recent economic crisis, while Keynesians (like himself) have been on target:
Remember how running the printing presses was going to cause runaway inflation? Since the recession began, the Fed has more than tripled the size of its balance sheet, but inflation has averaged less than 2 percent.
Krugman calls Stockman's analysis of our economic history as
pretty much standard liquidationism, with a strong goldbug streak.
goldbug streak - I wonder if that is intended at least in part to link Stockman to the craziness of the likes of Glenn Beck, who after all has been a paid mouthpiece for gold interests?
Perhaps not, since Stockman basically asserts that we have been going to Hell in a handbasket since FDR took us off the gold standard, and have been on sprees ever since:
spending sprees, consumption sprees, debt sprees, and above all money-printing sprees. If disaster was somehow avoided for 70-plus years, it was thanks to a series of lucky accidents.
In a sense, all of that tartness is simply preface from Krugman, who then provides an important economic lesson on our rising debt.  Yes, it has increased as a portion of GDP.  The amount that is foreign has increased, albeit less than most Americans think, but that it mainly America borrowing from Americans
which doesn’t make the nation as a whole any poorer, and doesn’t require that we collectively spend less. In fact, the biggest problem created by all this debt is that it’s keeping the economy depressed by causing us collectively to spend too little, with debtors forced to cut back while creditors see no reason to spend more.
Remember, you do not pay taxes on interest earned from government bonds, and that investment is still considered absolutely safe.  Add to that  the large amounts of cash being held by corporations because inflation is so low and we we should already see the need for investment to stimulate spending.  As Krugman has noted for some time, because interest rates are currently so low, the government should, rather than cutting spending, be increasing it as a stimulus whose return will based on historic trends within a short time return far more in tax revenue than it will cost interest.  Such additional spending will also create increases in revenue for state and local governments, as sales and income tax streams increase, the price of real estate begins to return to higher levels, and then those governments can perhaps even rehire some of those employees they have been forced to lay off because they are required to run balanced government.  That rehiring adds additional spending which will also increase government revenue through taxation.
Krugman is all for restoring financial controls and oversight to deter excess leverage and prevent the next crisis.  
To deal with the crisis that’s already here, we need monetary and fiscal stimulus, to induce those who aren’t too deeply indebted to spend more while the debtors are cutting back.
This of course is ""anathema"" to Mellonites, like Stockman, like the deficit hawks, like Pete Peterson, like unfortunately too many Democrats as well.  They think that deficit spending - which in their minds includes any spending on the social safety net that does go through the private sector so that corporations can gain some direct profit  - is what has caused our current financial crises, which they measure primarily in the size of deficits and debts, never mind that the deficit increased under a Republican administration in part because of unnecessary tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations and fighting two wars without paying for them.  Krugman warns us that their approach of liquidation is destructive, because
by turning our problems into a morality play of sin and retribution, it helps condemn us to a deeper and longer slump.
Of course, the messaging from the Mellonites has been working.  As Krugman puts it ""sin sells.""  That is,
the notion of macroeconomics as morality play has a visceral appeal that’s hard to fight. Disguise it with a bit of political cross-dressing, and even liberals can fall for it.
This is happening not just on the macroeconomic level of the national economy.   We see it in the policies of Democratic mayors like Emanuel in Chicago, who use among other things the financial problems as a justification for slashing away at the basic local government function of public education, and finding ways of turning that function into something that can turn profits for the investor class and corporations, even as it destroys neighborhoods and ignores the needs of those hurting the most.
The real political cross-dressing comes from a Democratic President more committed to a ""grand bargain"" with ""bi-partisan"" support than he seems to be to rebuilding the economy for the long term.  What is sad is that he can clearly argue that he was right on stimulus spending.  That is, he could clearly argue had he pushed for a more significant stimulus the first time around.  Even so, the data supports him - rather than pushing for the grand bargain he should be pushing for more stimulus.
Krugman's column saddened me because of its ending, especially the words visceral appeal that's hard to fight.   I do not think it is impossible to fight but the rhetorical battle is already lost when the Democratic President accepts the framing of the argument in a way that cedes control to the Mellonites, whether they are simply hostile to government or merely wrong-headed about how governments and economies actually function.
Still, the column is important enough I wanted to bring to the attention of this community.  The link gets you past the firewall and does not count against your quota of Times stories for the month.
Read the whole thing.
It is worth the time.
But then, isn't that always true of Krugman?

Ali Velshi is CNN’s Chief Business Correspondent and Barack Obama’s Chief Sequester Propagandist. This so-called correspondent is a living breathing pipe-organ for the White House and its latest push to blame sequester — and by extension, the GOP — for Obama’s failed economic policies. 
A little after 2pm ET today, Velshi appeared on CNN with Brooke Baldwin. She asked how the business community is reacting to sequester. His response was to use both hands to grab hold of Obama’s talking points from earlier today and spread that sequester gospel like one of the president’s apostles:
Generally speaking the word from the business community is pretty standard. We are at a time in our economy where it would be useful to be building and expanding. We got unemployment edging down, jobs being created, very low interest rates, and an energy boom. We could be really moving to the top of the global pile in terms of economic activity, and this sort of thing [sequester] is like the government sticking its foot out just as your gaining speed as you’re running. 
Where to begin? 
This isn’t a little partisan spin coming from Velshi, it is full-blown Orwellian propagandizing. You expect this kind of flackery from David Axelrod, not someone CNN poses as an objective correspondent. 
1. Unemployment is not edging down. It is edging up. At best it’s stuck, and the CBO says it is going to stay stuck for at least another year. 
2. Job creation is barely treading water with population growth. 
3. An energy boom? Has Velshi filled his gas or home heating tank lately?
4. How exactly is our economy “gaining speed” when our economy plummeted around three-points last quarter to a growth level of one-tenth of one-percent? 
5. “We could be really moving to the top of the global pile?” Did Velshi really say that? Good grief. Even Obama is more careful with the happy talk. 
Then there are the lies of omission: The fact that we learned just today that the drop in income last month was the biggest in 20 years; and the fact that sequester represents about 2% of the federal budget, which translates to about a measly 1% of our GDP. 
The picture Velshi is outrageously and dishonestly trying to paint is that our economy is humming (when the EXACT opposite is true) and that, if it falters (to a point where even the media can’t happy talk it), the fault falls on the government being too small, which Obama tried so desperately to stop. 
But Velshi wasn’t done sucking up to Obama. Oh, no, someone’s looking for a “good dog” by blaming sequester in part on the right-leaning Chamber of Commerce:
But I have to tell you, the business community to some degree has fed this. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce really contributed to the partisanship and the election of people who are on both sides of this in Washington. And this is the result. 
In Velshi’s defense… he has earned that “good dog.”
Come on CNN, can’t you do a little better than this? The economy just might become the biggest story in the country soon. If you want to earn back an audience, you’re going to need a business correspondent with some credibility, respect for context, and more respect for the viewer than his failed agenda.

Over at Rolling Stone Magazine’s website, Matt Taibbi has just posted his feature story which will appear in the January 17th issue of the publication.
Personally, due to the sheer power of both the volume of facts presented and the extent of the effort by our government to obfuscate them for so many years, as detailed by Taibbi in the article, this gets my vote for the most powerful piece that he’s published at Rolling Stone in years. Perhaps ever.
Here’s an excerpt, immediately below. But, it doesn’t even begin to convey the historical expanse and depth of the pillaging of the 99% by Wall Street that we’ve witnessed over the past four-plus years; that is spelled out for us by Taibbi in the rest of the article, however.
It is, in a word: stunning!


Secret and Lies of the Bailout
The federal rescue of Wall Street didn’t fix the economy – it created a permanent bailout state based on a Ponzi-like confidence scheme. And the worst may be yet to come
Matt Taibbi
Rolling Stone
January 4th, 2013   4:25PM
It has been four long winters since the federal government, in the hulking, shaven-skulled, Alien Nation-esque form of then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, committed $700 billion in taxpayer money to rescue Wall Street from its own chicanery and greed. To listen to the bankers and their allies in Washington tell it, you'd think the bailout was the best thing to hit the American economy since the invention of the assembly line. Not only did it prevent another Great Depression, we've been told, but the money has all been paid back, and the government even made a profit. No harm, no foul – right?
Wrong.
It was all a lie – one of the biggest and most elaborate falsehoods ever sold to the American people. We were told that the taxpayer was stepping in – only temporarily, mind you – to prop up the economy and save the world from financial catastrophe. What we actually ended up doing was the exact opposite: committing American taxpayers to permanent, blind support of an ungovernable, unregulatable, hyperconcentrated new financial system that exacerbates the greed and inequality that caused the crash, and forces Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to increase risk rather than reduce it. The result is one of those deals where one wrong decision early on blossoms into a lush nightmare of unintended consequences. We thought we were just letting a friend crash at the house for a few days; we ended up with a family of hillbillies who moved in forever, sleeping nine to a bed and building a meth lab on the front lawn.
How Wall Street Killed Financial Reform
But the most appalling part is the lying. The public has been lied to so shamelessly and so often in the course of the past four years that the failure to tell the truth to the general populace has become a kind of baked-in, official feature of the financial rescue...
...
...The bailout deceptions came early, late and in between. There were lies told in the first moments of their inception, and others still being told four years later. The lies, in fact, were the most important mechanisms of the bailout…

…So what exactly did the bailout accomplish? It built a banking system that discriminates against community banks, makes Too Big to Fail banks even Too Bigger to Failier, increases risk, discourages sound business lending and punishes savings by making it even easier and more profitable to chase high-yield investments than to compete for small depositors. The bailout has also made lying on behalf of our biggest and most corrupt banks the official policy of the United States government. And if any one of those banks fails, it will cause another financial crisis, meaning we're essentially wedded to that policy for the rest of eternity – or at least until the markets call our bluff, which could happen any minute now.
Other than that, the bailout was a smashing success.

For the record, I’ve probably written 200 posts within this community on a variety of subjects and facts that Taibbi touches upon in the five webpages over at the Rolling Stone website that comprise the entirety of this article.

If you dare.
I have no doubt that I’m far from the only person that, after reading this, believes it just might be the most powerful Rolling Stone article Matt Taibbi has ever written.

Oh wait, they're already here ...



Oh wait, they're already here ...

John Boehner may have decided that he'd rather not plunge the United States into default quite just yet, but the true believers? They're mad. Really, really mad. A roundup of arsonist reactions:
Speaker Pelosi Part 2:  Opening Jan 5. 2015
— @DRUDGE



Rush Limbaugh:
Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday blasted the Republican Party as “irrelevant” and responsible for “creating one of the greatest political disasters” he’s ever seen.
“I was trying to think earlier today, if ever in my life I could remember any major political party being so irrelevant,” the conservative radio host said on his show, according to a transcript. “I have never seen it. I have never seen a major political party simply occupy placeholders, as the Republican Party is doing.”

Rush says the party still refuses to offer ""serious opposition"" to Obama, again claiming that this is because Obama is black.
Hardliner and actual CNN contributor Erick Erickson, or maybe he's not there anymore because who the hell watches CNN these days:
I am tired of funding Republicans who campaign against Obamacare then refuse to fight. It’s time to find a new batch of Republicans to actually practice what the current crop preaches.

The Tea Party Nation is very, very sad:
Barack Obama demanded unconditional surrender from the Republican Party. He pretty much got it. […]
In short, the GOP got nothing from their fight. But then again, McConnell, Boehner and the GOP establishment never tried.


As are a great many of the arsonists themselves, lighters still in hand:
Must be kidding. After 15 days and no proposal by Obama or Reid, GOP leadership may pass Democratic deal for them? http://t.co/...

But House conservatives like Raul Labrador know what the real problem with their plan was. It's the fault of that damn meddling media for saying House Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare instead of calmly explaining that the Republicans merely wanted to reasonably exchange defunding or delaying the law in exchange for allowing the federal government to continue to function. Stop painting us as unreasonable!
""We never asked for a full repeal of Obamacare because we can't get that,"" he said. ""We have voted on a full repeal of Obamacare that the Senate has rejected every single time. But what we were asking for, our position from the beginning, was exchanging a one-year CR for a one-year delay of Obamacare. That was something we thought both sides were giving on something.""


Much more, below the fold.



It wouldn't be a conservative civil war if the other side wasn't returning fire, and there's been plenty of that. For their part, the Houston Chronicle repudiated their own endorsement of Ted Cruz, apparently flummoxed that Cruz's brand of hardline far-right conservatism did not transform itself into something less insane once he gained office:
When we endorsed Ted Cruz in last November's general election, we did so with many reservations and at least one specific recommendation - that he follow Hutchison's example in his conduct as a senator.
Obviously, he has not done so. Cruz has been part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution.


And when you've lost Grover Norquist, you've lost the last thread tying yourself to supposed ""fiscal"" conservatism. Not that Norquist has any interest in tying himself to conservatism these days either, so ragged has the brand become:
“It’d be a good idea if they stopped referring to other Republicans as Hitler appeasers because they opposed the strategy they put forward which failed,” Norquist says. “I think if you make a mistake as big as what they did, you owe your fellow senators and congressmen a big apology — and your constituents, as well, because nothing they did advanced the cause of repealing or dismantling Obamacare.” […]
“These are the people who said, ‘Plan: Step One, Invade Iraq. Step Two, It turns into Kansas,’” Norquist says. “Could I ask if there’s anything in between Step One and Step Two? ‘Oh ye of little faith.’”


For his part, House Speaker John Boehner may yet keep his position after all of this—despite no apparent plan, ability to execute that plan, ability to hold his caucus in line, ability to count, ability to negotiate, ability to clearly articulate what exactly the damn demands were besides opening up a unicorn brothel for conservative House members. The general feeling among the arsonists is that well, at least he let them have a good solid go at it:
Speaking at an event with fellow conservatives, Labrador said he was “really proud” of Boehner’s handling of the fiscal crisis and that, over the last two-and-a-half weeks, “he has been the kind of Speaker I’ve been looking for for the last two-and-a-half years.” […]
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told The Hill, ""conservatives feel like he's fought the good fight .... You can quote me on that.""


But perhaps the most (ahem) ""interesting"" pro-Boehner premise paints him as a true genius who did all of this because well that was the plan all along you see.
By allowing Ted Cruz to shut down the government, and by accepting the strategic advice of the idiots at Heritage Action, Boehner taught the rank and file a lesson that they probably won’t forget any time soon.  Following the advice of those bozos will get you nowhere fast.
Yes. He only hurled himself down the stairwell to teach all you other chumps what happens when you do that. A brilliant plan indeed.

As for how this will all pan out? Who knows. Perhaps true conservatives will split off into a third party. Perhaps true conservatives will lock themselves in the wardrobe, refusing to come out until Narnia shows itself. Perhaps true conservatism will yet again be redefined in order to pretend this whole sorry episode never took place. Once Obama is out of office, that is. In the meantime, we'll be doing all of this all over again, from scratch, in just a few short months. That's  just how America rolls now, baby.

TPM reports, in an article titled ""With Traditional GOP Allies Defecting, Big Business Takes Sides With Obama,"" that Big Business is entering into the fray and it is not on the side of the Tea Party.
Having failed to persuade their traditional Republican allies in Congress to avert a government shutdown, business leaders fear bigger problems ahead, and they're taking sides with a Democratic president whose health care and regulatory agenda they have vigorously opposed.
President Barack Obama is embracing the business outreach, eager to employ groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street CEOs to portray House Republicans as out of touch even with their long-established corporate and financial patrons.
snip
On Wednesday, Obama is hosting chief executives from the nation's 19 biggest financial firms. Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to Congress signed by about 250 business groups urging no shutdown and warning against a debt ceiling crisis that they say could lead to an economically disastrous default.
snip
The letter circulated by the Chamber of Commerce urges lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling ""in a timely manner and remove any threat to the full faith and credit of the United States government.""
snip
Concerned, the Chamber of Commerce is preparing to participate in political primaries, protecting friendly lawmakers from conservative challengers. ""Clearly we're getting to a point where we need a Congress that's going to be productive, proactive and create a stable environment for economic growth and job creation,"" said Scott Reed, a Republican political consultant who is advising the chamber on its strategy.

The Koch Brothers do not really represent the one thousanth of one percent who have real economic power.  Many of them are at risk from the destruction of the world economy and a debt default will hurt them.  Thing are going well for the ultra-rich, and they are tied to the health of the system.  
It will be interesting to see a civil war among the Titans of Big Capital.  
Granted, they created the Frankenstein monster, but all the more reason for them to deal with it.  Money still talks in Republican circles and it will be interesting to watch this war.  Tea Party and Kochs vrs. Big Capital.  
An interesting anti-Fascist coalition including Labor and Big Capital.  It won't last, and should not since class struggle still continues, but it could put down the Tea Party.
Meanwhile, the Republican War on the United States of America continues.

Rep. Randy Neugebauer, today's Worst Congressman in America (NBC News)


Is there some damn law that says congressional Republicans have to be assholes? Is ""not being a gigantic prick to anyone you meet"" one of the now-countless things that will get you kicked out of the party? Rep. Randy Neugebauer (R-TX, because of course he is), come on down. Show the little people how being a grandstanding self-important ass is done.
In an astounding confrontation that took place yesterday at the World War II Memorial in DC, a Tea Party congressman from Texas appeared to blame the Park Service for denying veterans access to the facility — and then made a Park Ranger apologize for the shutdown. ""How do you look at them and ... deny them access?"" Rep. Randy Neugebauer asked the unidentified Ranger in an incredible exchange that was caught on camera by NBC Washington.
Are you… are you stupid? Do you honestly think that the problem with shutting down all the quote-nonessential-unquote functions of the entire United States government is that the first Park Ranger you meet was probably in on it? She wasn't in on it! You were in the meetings where it was decided who would be in on it! You, Mr. Neugebaur, raised your stubby little hand and declared you were in on it!
""It's difficult,"" the Ranger replied. ""Well, it should be difficult,"" scorned the congressman. ""It is difficult,"" the Ranger repeated. ""I'm sorry, sir.""
""The Park Service should be ashamed of themselves,"" said Neugebauer. ""I'm not ashamed,"" the Ranger retorted.
""You should be,"" sneered Neugebauer.

More on Rep. Neugebaur below the fold.



Are you even paying the Park Ranger you're sneering at, while demanding she personally and for free keep a monument open that you yourself closed? What is this, an asshole boss competition? Do you realize that they in fact let the veterans in even though you closed the monument, even though they do not get to set up a little podium and hold a press conference in which they publicly masturbate over their great patriotism in doing so? Do you realize how many citizens witnessing this event were contemplating whether it would be worth jail time to just punch you?
The good news is that the ordinary citizens nearby, who are not the press and who are not obligated to treat Randy Neugebauer Being An Asshole as quite literally just another day at the park, came to the Ranger's defense.
At that point, a crowd of onlookers got involved. ""Ask those questions of the people who aren't passing the budget,"" shouted a voice from the crowd. ""That's who you need to ask these questions to.""
""This woman is doing her job, just like me,"" shouted another. ""I'm a 30-year federal veteran -- I'm out of work.""

Rep. Neugebauer protested a bit, then quickly ran off to buy himself an even bigger flag for his pocket. Good God, man, just get out. Get out of the memorial, get out of the government, get out anything that does not involve you walling yourself up in a hillside bunker. The entire Texas Republican caucus needs to throw themselves in the Potomac—the Park Service will fish each of you out again when they are good and goddamn ready.

Paul Ryan thinks the second-highest child poverty in the developed world and sequestration are a great start, but there's more to be done.



Paul Ryan thinks the second-highest child poverty in the developed world and sequestration are a great start, but there's more to be done.

The United States ranks 34 out of 35 on a UNICEF measure of relative child poverty in developed nations. To be clear, that's 34 out of 35 in the bad way—second highest level, doing better than only Romania with more than 20 percent of children living in a household with an income below half the median.
But the picture looks even worse when you examine just how far below the relative poverty line these children tend to fall. The UNICEF report looks at something it calls the “child poverty gap,” which measures how far the average poor child falls below the relative poverty line. It does this by measuring the gap between the relative poverty line and the average income of poor families.
Alarmingly, the United States also scores second-to-last on this measurement, with the average poor child living in a home that makes 36 percent less than the relative poverty line.

This is the context before the start of sequestration, as Bryce Covert points out. With the full effects of sequestration yet to come, we've already seen kids cut from Head Start programs, less housing assistance available to families struggling to stay off the street, and homeless shelters losing funding among the sequester's effects that will hit poor kids directly.
Of course all of this is just a tiny taste of what Republicans would like to deal out to poor and struggling families through Paul Ryan's Republican budget. That's why Republicans wanted the sequester to happen to begin with, their whining about airports and White House tours notwithstanding.

UPDATED
In February Texas republican Governor Rick Perry made a trip to California. His supposed intent was to lure California businesses to Texas. The premise is that Texas is more business friendly than California. To be sure, Texas is a state that gives away over $19 Billion in taxpayer dollars even as it cuts basic and higher education. Instead of reinvesting its surplus in human capital, it is attempting to change the Texas constitution to return surplus dollars.
California has been seen as a basket case with regards to its exploding budget deficits. Interesting enough this was occurring during the administration of Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. He attributed the deficits to reduced tax revenues and overspending. He cut programs in draconian fashion but could never escape the reality that he was making the problem worse. Ultimately he did what both Reagan and Bush did, leave exploding deficits to their successors.
California now has a budget surplus. Depending on whose numbers one uses, it is anywhere from $1.2 billion according to the Governor or $4.4 billion according to the Legislature’s independent financial analyst. How did California do it and what should they do about the surplus?
Democrats President Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, and Governor Jerry Brown did not attempt an ideological game with blinders to the actual results. They tried basic arithmetic. They raised taxes. Interesting enough, the results were the same.
Bill Clinton got a balance budget with a surplus. Barrack Obama is seeing a budget deficit that is shrinking much faster than anyone expected and much faster than advised by economist for proven Keynesian economic reasons. Suffice it to say that the budget deficit hole left by two wars, two massive tax cuts, and a massive drug program on the credit card by the previous administration along with an irresponsible & intransigent Congress cannot be solved in two terms.
Jerry Brown remembered basic arithmetic as well as he brought California to a budget surplus. He raised taxes on the wealthy and cut programs (some more than he should). Does this sound familiar, the balanced approach? Time and time again the evidence is out there that it works and it improves the economy for all.
While Texas has a low unemployment rate comparatively, low regulations comparatively (effects?), low taxes comparatively, and tax dollar giveaways that are great for businesses in the short term, California must not attempt to remake its new found surpluses in Texas’ image. After all, rain in the desert makes for some of the most beautiful flora for a few weeks. We know exactly what happens after that. They dry up and die. The Texas flora may be flourishing as all the nutrients are being sucked out of the middle class. Twenty five percent of its people are without healthcare even as Governor Perry refuses to accept expanded Medicaid from Obamacare. Teachers’ wages are stagnant. Quality of public schools as measured by national tests is substandard and falling. Yet, the Texas governor wants to return surpluses.
The director of external affairs for the California Department of Finance, H. D. Palmer believes that a good deal of the surge in revenues are from a one time realization of capital games by wealthy individuals at the end of 2012 that is unlikely to reoccur. The Governor and many Democrats thus do not support significant increases in spending.
Some believe the governor simply want to leave a legacy of a budget solver and that inasmuch as the office of the independent legislative analyst believes there is a much bigger budget surplus, he is willing to err on the backs of the poor. Others believe because of the volatility of revenue gyration, much caution is needed. Speaker of the Assembly John A. Perez seem to have the most pragmatic solution. Put some of the revenues in a contingency fund and increase spending on scholarships to middle class students.
Maybe the reason back in February California companies did not bite on Governor Perry’s “sell Texas” tour is that inasmuch as they may love that the Governor of Texas is willing to pilfer the middle class to bring them to Texas, they know a pilfered middle class does not make the best workforce. California spending its surplus not on tax cuts, or abusive business incentives but instead on human capital in the form of education and improved healthcare is a sustainable long term solution.
California has a lot more work to do. A budget surplus is not enough. Policy that taxes appropriately and the wise investment of those dollars is of utmost importance. The governor must be commended for a job well done and the necessary caution in the use of his good fortune.

Yes, yes the Federal government is a horrible intrusion into all our lives and if only it could keep its nose out of the states' business! Right? Everyone knows that national monuments are just there - right? The Federal government doesn't actually 'do' anything to operate them, right? Well many of these states that depend on tourism dollars from national monuments discovered in no time flat how much they count on the Federal government to subsidize them. And were forced to admit it.



SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Obama administration’s willingness to reopen national parks shuttered by the government shutdown came with a big caveat: States must foot the bill with money they likely won’t see again.
So far, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona and New York have jumped at the deal. Governors in other states were trying to gauge Friday what would be the bigger economic hit — paying to keep the parks operating or losing the tourist money that flows when the scenic attractions are open.
South Dakota and several corporate donors worked out a deal with the National Park Service to reopen Mount Rushmore beginning Monday. Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day to pay the federal government to run the landmark in the Black Hills.

Well isn't that exactly what conservatives want - private donations to keep unessential things like 'monuments' functioning? Just like we're supposed to rely on charity for our healthcare?
Arizona officials said a deal reached Friday will mean visitors should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday.
In Utah, federal workers rushed to reopen five national parks for 10 days after the state sent $1.67 million to the U.S. government with the hope of saving its lucrative tourist season.
Just over 400 national parks, recreation areas and monuments — including such icons as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite — have been closed since Oct. 1 because of the partial government shutdown.

Officials in some states were not happy about paying to have the parks reopened.
Well of course not! It's the Federal Government's job to pick up the tab for running these places, we are just supposed to reap the benefits of the money that pours in from the tourism!
Of course Arizona's Jan Brewer is at the head of the line to feed at the trough:
In Arizona, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer balked at spending about $112,000 a day for a full reopening of the Grand Canyon. She said a partial reopening would be much cheaper while allowing tourists to visit and businesses to benefit.
“The daily cost difference is enormous, especially without assurances that Arizona will be reimbursed,” said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Brewer.
In the end, Arizona agreed to pay the Park Service $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open for seven days. The $93,000 a day is less than the $112,000 the federal government had said was needed to fund park operations each day.

Missouri's governor is working on a proposal to reopen its national monuments including the Gateway Arch. Nevada and Washington will not. Wyoming has said it can't afford to 'bail out' the federal government.
“Wyoming cannot bail out the federal government and we cannot use state money to do the work of the federal government,” Mead spokesman Renny MacKay said.
Good one. Nice  to know that the parasitic federal government is actually expected to do something. While blue states are also ponying up to keep their monuments and attractions open, it is well known that red states take more money from the federal government than they put in while the reverse is true of blue states. So it's a bit of an irony that they scream the loudest about intrusion from the nanny state and another bit of schadenfreude when they learn just how much they count on it.

Last night, Bill Maher explained the real reason conservatives should be so afraid of California — because we're a living experiment that shows everything they've been preaching is pure unadulterated bullshit.
And finally, New Rule: Conservatives who love to brag about American exceptionalism must come here to California, and see it in person.  And then they should be afraid.  Because while right-wingers are taking over places like North Carolina and Texas and even Wisconsin, California is creating the kind of modern, liberal nation the country as a whole can only dream about.  And not only can't the rest of the country stop us — we're going to drag you with us.  (audience cheering and applause)
Now, it wasn't that long ago that pundits were calling California a failed state and saying it was ungovernable.  But in 2010, when other states were busy electing whatever Tea Partier claimed to hate government the most, we elected a guy who actually liked it — Jerry Brown.  And without a Republican governor and without a legislature cock-blocked by Republicans, (audience laughter) a $27 billion deficit was turned into a surplus.
How?  Well it's amazing, really.  We did something economists call cutting spending and raising taxes.  (audience applause)  I know, it sounds like crazy science fiction, but you see, here in California, we're not just gluten-free and soy-free and peanut-free, we're Tea Party free!  (massive audience cheering and applause)
Yes, we can live in reality!  I mean, Texas could do it too, but they love ""freedom"" too much.  Like when that unregulated fertilizer plant blew up.  In California, when things blow up, it's because we're making a Jason Statham movie.  No, California is not perfect, but it is in our nature to try new things.  For example, now that it's clear Obamacare is going to be a success here, the movement to just go all the way to single payer is gathering steam.  (audience applause)
In lots of areas, California has decided not to wait around for the caboose part of America to get on board.  Yokels can mock ""European style democracies"" all they want.  We're building one here — gay marriage, pot smoking, regulating carbon.  And people like it.  The same way when Americans come back from a vacation in Europe, they all say the same thing: ""I saw titties on the beach!""  (audience laughter)  But they also remark on the modern airports and train stations over there, and the absence of beggars in the street, and food that tastes like food.  (audience applause)  And they wonder, ""Why can't we get that here?""
Well, you will be getting that here, courtesy of the Golden State.  Why?  Because we're huge.  We're huge!  40 million of us!  (audience cheering)  When we demand something, the market must supply it.  Like when California set a high mileage standard for cars sold in this state, Detroit had to make more efficient cars.  California by itself is the 8th largest economy in the world, the fifth largest agricultural exporter, and of course, #1 in laser vaginal rejuvenation.  (audience laughter)  Oh, I pat myself on the back.
You know, it's so ironic, the two things conservatives love the most — the free market and states rights — are the two things that are going to bend this country into California's image as a socialist fagtopia.  (audience cheering and applause)  Maybe our constipated Congress in Washington can't pass gun control laws, but we just did.  Because we don't give a shit about the NRA.  Out here, that stands for ""Nuts, Racists, and Assholes.""  (massive audience cheering and applause)
And while other state governments are working with Jesus to make abortion more miserable — because otherwise women would just use it for weight loss (audience oohs) — California is making it easier.  And while immigrants are demonized in Washington and elsewhere, in California we just OK'd driver's licenses for undocumented aliens.  (audience applause)  That's right, we're letting them drive cars — just like white people!  Because we can't be worrying about all the nonsense that keeps Fox News viewers up at night, when they should be in bed adjusting their sleep apnea mask.  (audience laughter)
So in conclusion, my message to the rest of America is just this: DO NOT RESIST!!  Kneel before Zod!  California has been setting the trend in America for decades, and it's not going to stop now.  We say jump, you say, ""Please, sell me new exercise clothes for jumping.""  (audience applause)  We said put cilantro in food, and dammit, you did, you put cilantro in food, even though neither one of us knows what it is.  And almond milk?  Come on!  We just had some extra almonds and thought we'd fuck with you.  (audience laughter)

Bill Maher also wrote up a fuller version of this New Rule over at Huffington Post.  One part that was cut out for time that was a good explanation of what happened was this.
Since then, everything Republicans say can't or won't work — gun control, immigration reform, high-speed rail — California is making work.  And everything conservatives claim will unravel the fabric of our society — universal healthcare, higher taxes on the rich, gay marriage, medical marijuana — has only made California stronger.  And all we had to do to accomplish that was vote out every single Republican.

Former president Bill Clinton writes a must-share opinion piece calling for the overturn of the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act:
When I signed the bill, I included a statement with the admonition that “enactment of this legislation should not, despite the fierce and at times divisive rhetoric surrounding it, be understood to provide an excuse for discrimination.” Reading those words today, I know now that, even worse than providing an excuse for discrimination, the law is itself discriminatory. It should be overturned.
We are still a young country, and many of our landmark civil rights decisions are fresh enough that the voices of their champions still echo, even as the world that preceded them becomes less and less familiar. We have yet to celebrate the centennial of the 19th Amendment, but a society that denied women the vote would seem to us now not unusual or old-fashioned but alien. I believe that in 2013 DOMA and opposition to marriage equality are vestiges of just such an unfamiliar society.

Paul Krugman of The New York Times looks at all the dire prediction of how President Barack Obama was going to destroy the economy:
the important point about these particular bad predictions is that they came from people who constantly invoke the potential wrath of the markets as a reason we must follow their policy advice. Don’t try to cover America’s uninsured, they told us; if you do, you will undermine business confidence and the stock market will tank. Don’t try to reform Wall Street, or even criticize its abuses; you’ll hurt the plutocrats’ feelings, and that will lead to plunging markets. Don’t try to fight unemployment with higher government spending; if you do, interest rates will skyrocket.
And, of course, do slash Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid right away, or the markets will punish you for your presumption.
By the way, I’m not just talking about the hard right; a fair number of self-proclaimed centrists play the same game. For example, two years ago, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson warned us to expect an attack of the bond vigilantes within, um, two years unless we adopted, you guessed it, Simpson-Bowles.
So what the bad predictions tell us is that we are, in effect, dealing with priests who demand human sacrifices to appease their angry gods — but who actually have no insight whatsoever into what those gods actually want, and are simply projecting their own preferences onto the alleged mind of the market.

Carl Hulse at The New York Times on the other filibuster:
In a vote just before Mr. Paul,  the junior senator from Kentucky, tried to blockade the nomination of John Brennan as director of central intelligence over drone policy, the Senate failed to end debate on the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan of New York to a seat on the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia.
The filibuster of Ms. Halligan didn’t blow up on Twitter the way Mr. Paul’s impressive 12-hour stand did. But of the two, it was the one that could renew a feud over rules governing filibusters and how the Senate handles high-level judicial nominations — an issue that has torn the chamber for years.
Democrats are already in discussions on how to respond to the Halligan filibuster. They believe Republicans are dead set against confirming qualified Obama administration nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They accuse Republicans of exaggerating their objections to Ms. Halligan to justify a filibuster under a 2005 agreement that short-circuited the last partisan showdown over filling judicial vacancies.

Robert Nolan at U.S. News & World Report on the scars of the Iraq War:
Finally, while Sen. Rand Paul's filibustering speech on drones stole headlines regarding the vote for John Brennan to become the next director of the CIA this week, it's a Senate report on the use of enhanced interrogation techniques that could pose a greater problem for Brennan either now or early in his tenure. Though the report remains classified, The New York Times reports that Sen. John McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, will push for at least parts of it to be made public. Insiders note the report offers a scathing criticism of CIA interrogation programs like those portrayed in the film Zero Dark Thirty revealing a pattern of failure to disclose details or grossly distorting the success of the program.
If Zero Dark Thirty's performance at the Oscars is any indication—it was nominated but failed to win in any major categories—the American public doesn't care much to discuss the uncomfortable lessons of our involvement in Iraq over the past decade. As always, we avoid them at our own peril. As the saying goes, those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it.

Ron Dzwonkowski at The Detroit Free Press has a great profile of Senator Carl Levin, who has announced that he won't run for another term:
Seemed like every time we met, Carl Levin was wearing the same suit -- not quite gray, not quite brown, always a little wrinkled. Add the ever-present plastic reading glasses on the end of his nose and a wild swirl of gray hair that covered less of his head every year, and this was either a carefully cultivated professorial image or a guy who had more important things on his mind than how he looked.
After just a few of the regular meetings we had during my years on the Free Press editorial page, I knew it was the latter. But that's not to say there wasn't some of the former in the mix.
In an era when politicians take courses in telegenics and sound bites, Carl Levin was pretty much ... Carl Levin, and that was apparently OK with the voters of Michigan, who elected and re-elected him six times to the U.S. Senate and would probably have given him a seventh term next year if Levin hadn't said Thursday that he's done running.

Brad Bannon on how the Republican Party's policies are anything but mainstream:
At the surrender ceremony after the British defeat at Yorktown in 1781, the British band played “The World Turned Upside Down.” Republicans, like the British, will realize that America has changed only after they lost the battle and the war. A new generation of selfless voters, the millennials have replaced the baby boomers as the focus of American politics but Republicans are stuck in a time warp in the 1980s. As the world changes, Republicans cling to the past as hard as Fox News hangs onto the myth that it is fair and balanced.

Most politically astute and knowledgeable people remember that it was President Ronald Reagan who began the assault on our unions by taking on the Professional Air Traffic Controllers union (PATCO).  By refusing to negotiate with the union regarding pay and working conditions, and hiring replacements (i.e., scabs) to take their jobs, he set the stage for the ongoing eradication of unions and the working middle class. As The New York Times noted in 2011:
More than any other labor dispute of the past three decades, Reagan’s confrontation with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or Patco, undermined the bargaining power of American workers and their labor unions. It also polarized our politics in ways that prevent us from addressing the root of our economic troubles: the continuing stagnation of incomes despite rising corporate profits and worker productivity.
By firing those who refused to heed his warning, and breaking their union, Reagan took a considerable risk. Even his closest advisers worried that a major air disaster might result from the wholesale replacement of striking controllers. Air travel was significantly curtailed, and it took several years and billions of dollars (much more than Patco had demanded) to return the system to its pre-strike levels. [...]
By 2010, the number of workers participating in walkouts was less than 2 percent of what it had been when Reagan led the actors’ strike in 1952. Lacking the leverage that strikes once provided, unions have been unable to pressure employers to increase wages as productivity rises. Inequality has ballooned to a level not seen since Reagan’s boyhood in the 1920s.

This event was and is rightfully considered a watershed moment in the Republican Party's attempts to destroy unions and the union movement.  Since Reagan took on PATCO, unions have seen their membership number decline precipitously, and most working class Americans have seen their wages and salaries stagnant, even as the individuals (CEO's, Senior executives, and people like Mitt Romney and his former firm Bain Capital) who control major corporations and industries have seen their pay and income soar to levels once though unimaginable.
What many may not know, however, is that Ronald Reagan in the last days of the 1980 election campaign, sent a letter to the President of PATCO, Robert E. Poli, promising he understood the many numerous concerns air traffic controller had with their pay, outmoded equipment and working conditions.  Specifically, he promised to provide them with the most up-to-date equipment and to work with them to provide more staffing and less brutal work schedules in the interest of public safety.  Here's a image of Reagan's letter to Pioli, dated October 20, 1980:

For those having difficulty reading the content of that letter from the image, here is a transcription of the text in full:
Dear Mr. Poli:
I have been briefed by members of my staff as to the deplorable state of our nation's air traffic control system.  They have told me that too few people working unreasonable hours with obsolete equipment has placed the nation's air travelers in unwarranted danger.  In an area so clearly related to public policy the Carter administration has failed to act responsibly.
You can rest assured that if I am elected president, I will take whatever steps are necessary to provide our air traffic controllers with the most modern equipment available and to adjust staff levels and work days so that they are commensurate with achieving a maximum degree of public safety.
As in all other areas of the federal government where the President has the power to appoint, I fully intend to appoint highly qualified individuals who can work harmoniously with Congress and the employees of the governmental agencies they oversee.
I pledge to you that my administration will work very closely with you to bring about a spirit of cooperation between the president and the air traffic controllers.  Such harmony can and must exist of we are to restore the people's confidence in their government.
Sincerely,
Ronald Reagan

Based in part on this this letter Poli and other senior PATCO officials had PATCO endorse Reagan for President.  PATCO was one of only four AFL-CIO affiliated unions to endorse Reagan over Carter.
[N]ewly elected PATCO president Robert Poli—who’d succeeded the more irenic incumbent John Leyden in a surprise insurgent challenge—was keen to demonstrate his clout before the union’s restive rank and file. He presumed to be bargaining from a position of strength because during the run-up to contract negotiations, PATCO had sought to secure firm Washington backing with another surprise move: it endorsed Reagan in the 1980 election, partly as a matter of heeding the shifting national mood, and partly out of sheer exasperation with the Carter administration’s handling of key controller concerns.
Never has a Union leader made a more serious mistake in judgment.  The Reagan appointed head of the FAA failed to negotiate in goof faith, reacting to PATCO's demand for pay raises, improved equipment and less arduous working hours with a counteroffer equal to approximately 1/7 of the cost of the union's offer.  Poli accepted the offer, but did so with little enthusiasm.  Reagan had doubled crossed him and put his position with PATCO's membership at risk. The administration's hard line only encouraged those at PATCO to strike, which was Reagan's goal all along.  
He immediately invoked the Taft-Hartley act and fired all the striking air controllers on August 5, 1981, a total exceeding 11,000.  Reagan then hired 5.500 scabs as the FAA head, Drew Lewis claimed that there had been a ""surplus of controllers.""  The FAA also reduced flights by 25% and also brought in 370 military controllers.  Though the FAA promised to have staffing levels up to pre-1981 levels within two years, in fact it took almost a decade before those levels were again achieved.  This was due partly to Reagan's ban on rehiring any of the fired PATCO controllers.  
Reagan never had any intention of working with the union.  This can be best demonstrated by the fact that in February, the Reagan Department of Justice, aided by the FAA, had complied a list of air traffic controllers to arrested and prosecuted in the event of a strike.  One Federal District Judge in Denver threw out all the criminal indictments against local PATCO officials, labeling the Reagan DOJ's actions as creating a ""hit list"" at a time when the government was supposed to be negotiating with the union in ""good faith.""
Today, of course, the Republican candidates feel free to openly demonize unions and seek to destroy the right to collectively bargain.  We've seen the actions of Republican governors elected in 2010 as proof of that.  The nation's political landscape is vastly changed by what Reagan accomplished in his showdown with PATCO.  Reagan gambled that he could get away with his lies back then, and he succeeded.  Now Republicans can lie on a daily basis and no one in the media even bothers to check the claims they make, the numerous falsehoods and prevarications they promulgate.  Now the unions are shrinking, and they more often than not refuse to strike our of fear.  Now Democrats govern as 1990's era Republicans, catering far to often to the wealthy elites and multinational corporations and failing to support unions.
And it all started with Ronnie Reagan's sweet little lie to the air traffic controllers.  He wasn't concerned about the safety of air travel.  He wasn't willing to work with PATCO to improve working conditions or modernize our air traffic control system.  He wanted an easy target to make the case that unions are bad for America, and he hoodwinked PATCO into believing he would act honorably and treat them fairly.  He lied, and we have been paying the price for it ever since.

WaPo:
Tea party groups, along with some skeptical liberals, say the [bipartisan-developed Common Core] standards amount to a federal takeover of education in a country with a long tradition of local control over public schools.
Some conservatives have seized on an optional side project that would have made it possible for states to share student records and test results with researchers, education officials and even software developers. Supporters described the voluntary data sharing, funded by private foundations, as a tool to help educators design effective classroom practices. But critics decried it as a Big Brother intrusion — and several states have indicated that they won’t participate.

Basic principles: you cannot work in the tea party on anything, and they are paranoid about everything. Their paranoia is aided and abetted by the national press (yet again) over non-scandals. Lesson learned yet, Washington?
NY Times:
“Now, we’re seeing the arrogance. We’re seeing the cronyism in practice in this second term,” Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently asserted, sounding a lot like his vice-presidential candidate self from 2012, when Republicans spent a good deal of time attacking the president as a self-satisfied autocrat who used his power to reward friends and punish enemies.
Not everyone in the party, however, is so sure that they can expand their ranks in Congress or improve their standing among voters by personally attacking the president, whose likability ratings stand near 80 percent even if only half of Americans approve of his job performance. And they are cautioning their fellow party members to avoid building their campaigns around the same kinds of messages that have fallen flat before.

WaPo:
Japan, the largest market for U.S. wheat exports, suspended imports from the United States and canceled a major purchase of white wheat on Thursday after the recent discovery of unapproved genetically modified wheat in an 80-acre field in Oregon.
How the altered crop made its way to the Oregon field remains a mystery. The strain was developed by Monsanto to make wheat resistant to the company’s own industry-leading weed killer. Monsanto tested the type of altered seed in more than a dozen states, including Oregon, between 1994 and 2005, but it was never approved for commercial use.

More politics and policy below the fold.



NY Times on the uneven recovery:
While the fiscal picture is brightening around the country, with many states expecting surpluses this year after years of deficits and wrenching budget crises, mounting Medicaid costs and underfunded retirement promises are continuing to cloud their long-term outlook.
Gail Collins:
The governor’s race there has a dandy ethics controversy that began with charges that a businessman with a rather dicey background gave Gov. Bob McDonnell $15,000 to pay for the catering at his daughter’s wedding. Actually, this would have been perfectly legal if McDonnell had just disclosed it. Under Virginia’s ethics laws, the governor can accept anything — house, car, private jet, former Soviet republic — as long as he puts it in the proper form.
He also might have been able to get off the hook when the transaction was discovered, just by saying he forgot to mention it. (Virginia’s rules are more flexible than a Slinky.) But McDonnell claimed total innocence, arguing that the $15,000 was a wedding gift to his daughter and, therefore, didn’t count.

Our Governor (John Rowland) went to jail for having a contractor work on his house and trying to hide it.
NY Times editorial:
Republicans are doing their best to persuade Americans that the Affordable Care Act will drive health insurance premiums so high that consumers will experience “rate shock.” That fear-provoking tale seems much less credible now that the rates proposed by health insurers for individual coverage on the new health care exchanges have been made public in several states. For the most part, the premiums will increase only slightly or even decrease for individuals and family coverage on the exchanges, electronic marketplaces in which consumers choose among a variety of plans with differing benefits and costs.
Charles Blow:
As a new effort at comprehensive immigration reform inches its way forward in the Senate, dissent from many conservatives is revealing their true contempt for, and fear of, the possibility that demographic groups who look different from their base will accrue power.
WaPo editorial:
Partisan interests change; the principles that must guide the Senate in considering presidential nominees do not. For the government to function properly, the president must place nominees in open [court] seats following a quick and fair review in the Senate. Fair does not mean opposing nominees because the other party disagrees with things would-be judges have written or said. Fair is not blocking appointments because they might change the ideological balance or because lawmakers view — for now — a court to be too big. The test is whether the president’s nominees to fill legitimate vacancies are well-qualified to serve. Both parties have violated these principles in recent years. But now it’s the Republicans who are in opposition.

National Science Foundation

Republicans finally are doing something about the increasing conflict between science and their own political ideologies and beliefs. They're trying to stop such science from happening. As explained by Jeffrey Mervis of Science Magazine:
The new chair of the House of Representatives science committee has drafted a bill that, in effect, would replace peer review at the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a set of funding criteria chosen by Congress. For good measure, it would also set in motion a process to determine whether the same criteria should be adopted by every other federal science agency.
The legislation, being worked up by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), represents the latest—and bluntest—attack on NSF by congressional Republicans seeking to halt what they believe is frivolous and wasteful research being funded in the social sciences. Last month, Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) successfully attached language to a 2013 spending bill that prohibits NSF from funding any political science research for the rest of the fiscal year unless its director certifies that it pertains to economic development or national security. Smith's draft bill, called the ""High Quality Research Act,"" would apply similar language to NSF's entire research portfolio across all the disciplines that it supports.

Of course, the Republicans claim it's about cutting waste and duplicative research, and ensuring that the funded science has value. Because it's not scientists who would know what scientific research has value, it's Congress. Which is an interesting position for Republicans to take, given their supposed antipathy to government. Or maybe that antipathy is limited to government regulating the Republicans' corporate owners. But here's one clear area where Congressional Republicans might consider scientific research of little value:
Researchers know that human activities including fossil fuel use, agriculture and land use have been the dominant causes of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past 250 years. In addition, aerosols and land surface changes are also altering the Earth's climate, making it extremely likely1 that human activities have had a net warming effect since 17502. These human-caused changes to the climate system, and their consequences, provide much of the impetus for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) climate change research.
Researchers funded by NSF have discovered signs of a changing climate in nearly every corner of the globe, from the icy expanses of Earth's polar regions to its equatorial ecosystems. Our planet's climate affects--and is affected by--the sky, land, ice, sea, life and the people found on it. To piece together the entire puzzle of climate change--what we know, what we still have to learn and what humankind can do to prepare for the future--we must study all of the physical, natural and human systems that contribute to and interact with Earth's climate system.
As researchers piece together the climate puzzle, they are revolutionizing the way we understand the Earth system as a whole. Researchers have realized that they must reach across disciplinary boundaries to study questions that extend beyond any one field of science or engineering. In fact, because of the complexity of Earth's climate, this research involves contributions from nearly every field of science, math and engineering.

The science proving human-caused climate change is overwhelming. Republicans overwhelmingly ignore and deny what the science proves. So, with scientific reality so consistently demonstrating a liberal bias, the Republicans are trying to legislate that science away.

Good luck with that, Texas



Good luck with that, Texas

Oh, Texas.  What to do with you.
So mere hours after the Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Texas wasted no more time and re-instituted the same redistricting plan the courts had already ruled as unconstitutional.  The same with their new voter suppression bill.
Attorney General Holder was having none of it, however.  Texas was the first lawsuit to be filed by the Justice Department under Section 2 of the Voting Right Act.  
And now Texas is presenting its defense. It is using two main arguments.
And boy, are they doozies.
Jump below the Chee-to for more:


First, says Attorney General Greg Abbott, the redistricting is not about race.  Oh no.  It's about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote.  White Democrats too.
From their brief:
DOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011, both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities, and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations, and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions, even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.
Translation:
""So, basically, we just want to fuck over all Democrats, and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt, well, they shouldn't vote for Democrats, should they?  It's only collateral damage""
You know, having them actually come right out and say it--that they don't want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising.  But it's good that they're doing it at last.  
But wait!  There's more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination, Texas is using the argument that ""Yeah, there may be an isolated incident or two, but it's NOTHING like it was in 1965"".  
From the article, which says it better than I can:
Furthermore, the state claims, even if Texas did discriminate, and the state stresses that it did not, it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses, what’s the big whoop?
So, according to this, Texas is arguing that Section 2, and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965.  And that since ""things are better than in 1965"" then Section 2 is null and void.
I think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.  
However, there is a danger here.  Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process.  Sort of like an ""originalism to the extreme"" argument.  
And that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.  
Not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments, but that's another story.

322,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/08/16/politico-misdirects-from-obamas-collapsing-numbers,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Politico Misdirects From Obama's Collapsing Numbers,"

Politico’s Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei stretched their writing wings and penned an editorial Thursday night on the looming collapse of the Republican party. Allen and VandeHai, whose day jobs are to undercut the GOP and its candidates, feign concern that the party isn’t doing enough to appeal to voters who don’t support the party. A more interesting story for the democrats-with-by-lines is the precipitous drop in support for Obama on every major issue. 
According to Gallup, just 35% of Americans support Obama’s handling of the economy. In early June, before Obama embarked on an extensive tour of speeches about the economy, 42% approved of his efforts. In other words, the more he talked about the economy, the less Americans approved of how he was handling it. 
It isn’t just the economy, though. Americans don’t support how Obama is handling virtually every issue. Only 26% support Obama’s handling of the federal deficit. Taxes? 36% approve. Foreign Affairs? 40%. Immigration? 39%. Health Care? 39%. Only on fighting terrorism (50%) and race relations (51%) does Obama win the backing of a majority, just, of Americans. 
Obama basically has the backing of the Democrat base and no one else. With Republicans holding the House, 30 Governorships and more state legislative districts and statewide offices than almost any time in history, and likely to make gains in the Senate next year, it seems it is the Democrats who are on Allen and VandeHai’s “eve of destruction.”  
To stitch together their partisan theory, Allen and VandeHei point to perceived problems the GOP has with African-Americans, Hispanics and gays. None of these demographic groups ever formed any meaningful part of a winning coalition for the GOP. No political party should actively try to alienate a block of voters, but the GOP’s path to future victory isn’t paved with pandering appeals to these groups either. 
Politico’s editorial is largely built around the presumed need for the GOP to pass some kind of amnesty legislation to appeal to Hispanic voters. While it is certainly true that the nation needs to reform its broken immigration system, reform comes in many varieties. A recent poll found that 60% of Hispanics want the border secured before amnesty is granted, a position in line with a majority of the GOP caucus in the House. Allen and VandeHai make the mistake of accepting the conventional wisdom in DC that “immigration reform” means accepting the Senate “Gang of 8” bill. In the alternative universe that is reality, the issue is far more complex.   
Even if the House GOP were to reverse course and embrace amnesty, it isn’t at clear they would benefit at the ballot box. George H. W. Bush was part of an Administration that actually granted amnesty to illegal immigrants, and he received the lowest percentage of support from Hispanics than almost any time previously. If Mitt Romney had magically received 70% of the Hispanic vote last year, he still would have lost to President Obama. There just aren’t enough voters in any of the demographics Politico focuses on to make that much of a difference for the GOP.
Mitt Romney largely lost the election last year because millions of conservatives and working-class whites failed to show up at the polls. In the last two cycles, the party nominated the moderate, centrist candidates the media barks the GOP needs and large swathes of the party’s base stayed home. The GOP would be better served “auditing” its outreach and messaging to these groups than fine-tune its messaging to groups preternaturally wired to vote against the party. 
In modern political history, the GOP has won when it has embraced its conservative principles and articulated a message of freedom and enterprise. Freedom is the most inclusive message in politics. As the late Andrew Breitbart used to say, “If we can’t sell Freedom, we suck.” 
Allen and VandeHei would rather the GOP adopt the Democrat playbook and make explicit appeals based on identity politics. An healthy dash of racial politics with a pinch of feminist rhetoric. It is a recipe for disaster for the GOP. Which is, of course, why Politico is pushing it.   
If Republicans choose to take advice from hacks like Allen and VandeHai, then they deserve the failures they will surely reap.

Democrats couldn't win without 'em!



Democrats couldn't win without 'em!

Republicans decided to figure out why young voters were avoiding their party like MySpace:
The most damning conclusions lay in the survey’s examination of how people view the two major parties in terms of broad attributes. For Democrats, young voters chose “tolerant,” “diverse” and “open-minded,” while for Republicans they often chose “rich” and “religious.”
In focus groups in January, the report said, young voters were asked to list leaders of the Democratic Party. “They named prominent former or currently elected officials: Pelosi, the Clintons, Obama, Kennedy, Gore. When those same respondents were asked to name Republican leaders, they focused heavily on media personalities and commentators: Bill O’Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck.”
So it’s not terribly surprising that when they were asked what words came to mind when they heard ""Republican Party,"" the results ""were brutal — closed-minded, racist, rigid, old-fashioned.""

Per the exit polls:

18-24: Obama 60, Romney 36
25-29: Obama 60, Romney 38
30-39: Obama 55, Romney 42
40-49: Obama 48, Romney 50
50-64: Obama 47, Romney 52
65+: Obama 44, Romney 56

The circle of life and all, this is horrible news for the GOP. Their strongest supporters are the most likely to not be around the next cycle. Meanwhile, those young voters aren't just young, but also heavily brown. The median age of a native-born Latino is 18. As of last month, Latinos students outnumber their white counterparts in Texas schools. In 10 years, that'll be true for everyone in the state.
So when these youngsters talk about ""racist"" and ""rigid"" and ""closed-minded"" Republicans, they do so not just as an observation, but from personal experience. And with the GOP so closely branded with the buffoonery of Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly, there is little chance the party can reverse that perception; Republicans aren't about to start distancing themselves from their right-wing media overlords.
Limbaugh and O'Reilly like to brag about their power, and it's true. They've been clearly instrumental in costing Republicans the millennial vote for a generation, if not forever.

Political drama of the highest order unfolded here in Austin this last week. Conservative legislators planned to pass new restrictions and onerous regulations on clinics offering pregnancy counseling for thousands of women in Texas. By Tuesday morning they were under the gun, the session due to close at midnight, with a key piece of the Republican war on women still waiting lonely in the wings like an old sing-song bill waiting on capital hill. That's when state senator Wendy Davis got the floor, refused to yield, and the people's filibuster was on:
At 11:18 a.m. this morning, State Senator Wendy Davis began a filibuster against SB5, which includes some of the most restrictive anti-woman anti-choice regulations in the nation. ... For more on what this awful bill does, click here.
I got a chance to watch some of it in person, talk to some supporters and read some background, and concluded Wendy Davis is what any Texan worth their boots would call a tough hombre. She doesn't merely sympathize with working people, she is one of us. Davis hit the workforce at age 14 to help support her single mother who was trying to raise four children while working at an ice cream shop. By age 19 she was a single mom herself. Despite those challenges, she worked her way through community college as an entry level paralegal, went on to attend nearby Texas Christian University where she graduated first in her class despite working two jobs to make ends meet. If that's not impressive enough, Davis went on to Harvard Law School, graduating with a law degree at age 33. During which time she had another child. On Tuesday that determination was in full force. Join me below for the rest of the epic story.
But first: Sign the Daily Kos petition to draft Wendy Davis to run for governor!


Like every other state where Republicans have gained control, the promised focus on jobs has morphed into an ugly war on women justified on narrow quasi-religious pretext. Something on the order of a thousand bills have been put up assaulting women's rights and women's health. Texas is no exception and the only thing between SB5 being rammed through easily before the clock struck twelve was one brave state senator and a few hundred spectators.
Majority Leader Reid take note: this is old school filibustering. According to rules of the Texas Senate, Davis had to stand for the entire time, could not eat anything, not so much as a sip of water. She could not lean or sit or otherwise use any desk or chair for support, she could not even take a quick bathroom break! Despite these restrictions, Davis stood her ground and spoke passionately, nonstop, through the day, into the evening, and on toward midnight. Real and virtual crowds grew, #SB5 exploded to become a top trending tag on Twitter.
Thanks to the Texas Tribune's live feed and many onsite tweets with expert commentary keeping readers informed minute to minute, it soon became clear we were witnessing a rare event, indeed a very special one, the birth of a new progressive champion on the national stage was unfolding before our eyes. In the deep red Lone Star State of all places! But with midnight on the horizon, the filibuster was suddenly shut down in its tracks. Naturally, by Texas Republicans on dicey technicalities. Hopes were briefly dashed.
When I got home after 11 PM, pessimistic, I found it was not covered live on any cable news station I could find. But online was a completely different story, the excitement was palpable, someone had stood up to the powerful good ole boys who have held sway over Texas for far too long.
That's when the people took over. Democrats on the floor quickly called up parliamentary procedures buying critical minutes, news ripped through the crowds and they starting voicing their disgust. With galleries in the rotunda overflowing, the clock ticking down, the eyes of Texas and the nation upon them and the crowd now roaring, republicans were literally in disarray. They grew desperate, eventually trying to hold a quiet, hasty vote just after the midnight curfew, back-date it on the ledge page, and then adjourn, perhaps smug in the belief they had won. Early Wednesday morning the Texas Tribune reported that that blatant violation will not stand:
The nation watched on Tuesday — and into Wednesday — as Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and hundreds of impassioned reproductive rights advocates stalled proceedings and ultimately defeated controversial abortion legislation in a storm of screams and shouts as the clock struck midnight.
""I am overwhelmed, honestly,” Davis said after standing for nearly 13 hours to filibuster Senate Bill 5, the abortion legislation. The outpouring of support from protesters at the Capitol and across the nation, she said, “shows the determination and spirit of Texas women and people who care about Texas women.""

Wendy Davis and her dedicated professional staff are no strangers to standing up for the people against long odds, even when they know they might lose, or worse. They are certainly familiar with the consequences that can follow in this day and age. The Davis Fort Worth office was fire-bombed last year. Davis is already being demonized for her stand. The GOP will try again, any way they can, to get SB5 passed. Rick Perry has already announced another special session to ram this odious bill through. We will all try again, we will try to shame them and expose them and use every legal and ethical method to kill the bill. Nevertheless, the battle field is tilted against us, we may lose the skirmish.
But one day we will win the battle. Thanks to lots of people, like Wendy Davis and her staff (A staff I'm told is almost legendary in the commitment and resources they devote to constituent services) the tide may be beginning to turn in Texas faster than we could have dared hope! In fact she's reportedly considering a run in the 2014 Texas governor's race. Even in the event of a close defeat, such a run would badly rattle the GOP and boost progressive morale. It would also field test how organized the growing coalitions of disaffected voters in Texas that would engineer that revolution are becoming. If she were to pull off an upset, the implications for future elections far and wide are devastating for the GOP beginning immediately.
That will be a major lift, we'll need all the help we can get, and I'm not talking about money, not today folks. I'm talking about support. If you want to consider getting more involved at some point, high school kids through retirees anxious to throw in with the underdog candidate against the Harkonnens might be needed in droves. I'm talking unpaid door knockers, phone banking and data entry, too. Most of all, before this can even begin to coalesce, the Davis office needs to see the mojo; something that ought to be familiar in concept here! But this isn't asking much, many have done way more for a lot less. History is rife with examples.
In the Battle of Cowpens, General Daniel Morgan only asked his rag-tag irregulars to take two good shots before retreating in the face of the better trained and heavily armed British Army. It was brilliant strategy, Continental Irregulars stood their ground and made those two shots count, the seemingly invincible British lines panicked, some began to fold, the tide soon turned in favor of the underdogs, and no less than George Washington's relative [Correction DS] chased Bernaste Tarlton off the field of battle in final defeat. It was one of the key turning points in the long, bloody Revolutionary War. Many of the fallen on that day were mere teenagers, boys really, who who never got to grow up. But thanks to them and others like them, our revolutions today are no longer fought with guns and steel on blood-stained fields littered with corpses. To our great national pride we now hold bloodless revolutions regularly, at the ballot box, in peace.
I believe we can open up fault lines in the Texas republicans using similar, proven, asymmetric tactics to bring about a modern day electoral revolution in what has been a reliable GOP stronghold critical to republican victories. No one's asking for two shots, all we need to get started is for you take two minutes to drop Davis and her staff a note of encouragement here via Daily Kos and/or here on her site.
Let them know this is not a one day phenomenon, a mere fifteen minutes of fame, and that we will always remember and support those who risk their livelihoods and careers to do what is right for millions of disenfranchised people. Who will remain increasingly isolated and exiled from meaningful political influence without progressive champions like Wendy Davis.

Gallup reports that President Obama’s approval rating slipped again in the 2nd Quarter, falling to 47.9%. The dip was the second quarterly drop in a row. At the end of last year, on the heels of his reelection, Obama’s approval rating stood at 51.9%. His approval rating is near the bottom of second-term Presidents at this point in their tenure. 
Both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton had significantly higher approval ratings at this point in their Presidencies. Reagan enjoyed a 58.7% approval rating, while Clinton’s approval was slightly lower, 56.3%. Gallup notes that Obama’s poll numbers more closely resemble George W. Bush and Harry Truman. Truman’s approval rating was 48.7%. Bush’s was slightly lower than Obama’s at 47.3%.
Over the next three months, the 19th Quarter in office, every modern President has seen a decline in their approval ratings, with the exceptions of Reagan and Clinton. Both Presidents were presiding over a strong and growing economy. Obama will be presiding, at best, over a weak and stagnant economy. 
Obama faces particular challenges over the next three months, however. This Fall, Washington will be consumed with another fight over raising the nation’s debt ceiling and passing a budget. The last time Obama and Congress fought over the debt ceiling, his approval ratings fell to the lowest of his time in office, 41%. 
Also, in October a major piece of his ObamaCare law is scheduled to go into effect, the federal and state health insurance exchanges. As with any major government undertaking, there are likely going to be problems with the implementation. Massive problems, however, which are not unlikely, could further erode Obama’s approval. 
Obama’s challenge is that he is in a weak position to absorb those threats to his approval. Just a drop of a few points would put his approval in the low 40s. That is a weak position heading into an important election year, when the Democrats are at serious risk of losing control of the Senate. 
Senate Democrats would likely continue to chart their own course, moving themselves away from Obama and the White House. The success or failure of Obama’s second term may be decided this Fall.

Last Friday, Bill Maher closed with a New Rule explaining how various right-wing groups get to have their voices heard and their legislation enacted, despite the majority — and in some cases a vast majority — of Americans not in favor of their right-wing views.
And finally, New Rule: If your conservative advocacy group is demanding that Geico pull this ad

because the depiction — as a joke, of course — of a woman on a date with a cartoon pig might encourage bestiality, while you're also demanding that Skittles remove this ad

where a woman kisses a walrus because it may — yes, you guessed it — encourage bestiality, you have to ask yourself this: Aren't you thinking a little too much about bestiality?
I mean, seriously, if I'm the depraved Hollywood liberal, how come when I see these ads, I don't think, ""Oh, bestiality, you forbidden fruit, how you tempt me!""  Not even a little.  But, you, wholesome Christian do-gooder, see this and think, ""Please, Jesus, give me the strength to not fuck my cat!""  (wild audience applause)
Now, I only bring this up because the Christian pressure group responsible for protesting these ads is called One Million Moms, and they are an example of a much larger problem we need to deal with, a problem I call shit-kicker inflation.  Which is the phenomenon of all things conservative being portrayed as way bigger than they really are.
To wit, I looked up One Million Moms on Twitter, and the number of followers they have is 2,258.  That's how many my Aunt Marjorie has, and she's got one post, and it says, ""Is this thing working?""
And Million Moms are not alone in pretending they're not alone.  The Catholic League is another group constantly in the news because they also love to get freaked out about nonsense that would make even Pat Robertson go, ""Oh, for Christ's sakes, relax!""  But just as there aren't a million moms in One Million Moms, there is no league in the Catholic League.  It's one guy with a fax machine.
Now, a recent study found that politicians in both parties consistently thought that their constituents were much more conservative than they actually were.  And that's because there's a relatively small group of very shrill people devoted to — and succeeding at — convincing us that this is a much more conservative and religious nation than it is.  (audience applause)
Americans, for example, don't hate socialism.  They just can't define it.  Even though it's kind of right in the name ""Social Security"".  Kinda right in the name.  Which even Tea Partiers do not want to cut.
Same thing with Obamacare.  As an idea, it's unpopular.  But ask voters about the elements in it, they're all very popular.  It's like saying, ""I hate pizza!  I love tomato sauce and melted cheese on dough, but pizza?  I hate that shit.""
Same with guns!  We found out this week that gun ownership is actually down in this country.  Way down.  And yet the NRA, with just four million members, has a stranglehold on the gun policies in a nation of 300 million.
This misreading of where the public really is explains why at this moment, a cross-section of Republican politicians are at CPAC delivering a simple message to the right-wingers who keep losing them elections.  And that message is: ""Whatever you do, don't change.""  Among the featured speakers at CPAC this year include Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, Rick Santorum, Wayne LaPierre, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin — a virtual Who's Who of What The Fuck.  (audience cheering and applause)
And look, the convention is still going on, so I won't presume to know everything that's going to be said at this open mic from hell, but....  Oh, screw it!  Yes, I do know.  I know exactly what'll be said, because it's exactly what they always say.  They will get up, one after another, and say that they speak for the vast majority of real Americans who hate socialism and own guns and feel their values are under attack.
Except they don't speak for the vast majority of Americans, or a majority at all.  (audience applause)  They're just so loud they haven't noticed that America has moved on without them.  They're like a nasty, old man still bitching about the kids who keep hitting the ball into his yard, even though those kids have grown up and moved away.  And he's still the senior senator from Arizona.  (audience cheering)

Reading the Left’s fevered desires over at Slate isn’t anything new. 
Not even articles breathlessly titled and subtitled:
Go for the Throat! Why if he wants to transform American politics, Obama must declare war on the Republican Party.
Not even articles that read:
The president who came into office speaking in lofty terms about bipartisanship and cooperation can only cement his legacy if he destroys the GOP. If he wants to transform American politics, he must go for the throat. …
Obama’s only remaining option is to pulverize. Whether he succeeds in passing legislation or not, given his ambitions, his goal should be to delegitimize his opponents. Through a series of clarifying fights over controversial issues, he can force Republicans to either side with their coalition’s most extreme elements or cause a rift in the party that will leave it, at least temporarily, in disarray.
Slate is what it is and some bloodthirsty Slate writer orgasmic over the prospect of Obama permanently pulverizing and destroying the GOP is as noteworthy as green on grass.
Oh, except after someone like Brit Hume connects the dots. 
The author of this outrageous left-wing fever dream is John Dickerson, whom Slate describes as “Slate’s chief political correspondent”. What Slate leaves out of its little bio, though, is that Dickerson is also the political director at CBS News. 
Dickerson is merely being Dickerson, and  there’s no doubt he speaks for legions upon legions of those in the media today. 
What is worthy of note, though, is that a CBS News’ political director is now comfortable openly calling for the destruction of the Republican Party. He obviously fears no admonitions from his colleagues or his employer. And why should he? Earlier this week, Bob Schieffer, a CBS News “living legend,” was perfectly comfortable publicly comparing the NRA to Nazis. 
You lump all of this with CNN chief Jeff Zucker applauding Piers Morgan’s shameless feasting off the dead children of Sandy Hook for ratings and attention, and what you have is a media that’s finally … coming out. 
And yet, even as they do, even as they openly celebrate their left-wing biases out of one side of their mouth, out the other, they will claim they remain objective and unbiased. 
The Big Lie has officially arrived. 
And somewhere Dan Rather’s thinking, “Oh, so now it’s okay!?”

Republicans gave us the Cheneys. Now they pay the price.



Republicans gave us the Cheneys. Now they pay the price.

This sort of stuff is what makes Liz Cheney's decision to move from Virginia to Wyoming in order to run for U.S. Senate against Mike Enzi so much fun:
Rep. Cynthia Lummis, a two-term Republican lawmaker, called Cheney “the shiny new pony” in Wyoming politics, but slammed Cheney for a lack of etiquette in making her intentions known to her opponent, Sen. Mike Enzi.
“I don’t think she’s going about it the right way,” Lummis, R-Wyo., told a scrum of reporters in the Speaker’s Lobby during votes on Tuesday night.  [...] “There’s a great history of intraparty decorum in Wyoming, especially when it comes to these higher-profile offices, and certainly that decorum has been broken here,” she added. “I think it’s problematic.  I think it’s bad form.”

Of course Lummis is also annoyed because until Cheney entered the scene, she was the heir apparent to Enzi. In fact, if Enzi does bow out (which is still possible), she'll run in his place.
Like Lummis, Enzi himself (not surprisingly) is also whining about Cheney's entrance:
“She said that if I ran she wasn’t going to run, but obviously that wasn’t correct,” Enzi said, speaking to reporters as he left the Senate floor. “I thought we were friends. [...] It’s kind of interesting that about 30 minutes after I put out a release saying that I intend to run, she put out one saying she was running,” Enzi told reporters. “She’s watching pretty closely what I’m doing. This is different than what she was saying before — that if I didn’t run, she would run.”
Enzi sounds like he's offended by Cheney's decision to run, but he shouldn't be taking this personally. There are two reasons why she's running, and neither of them have anything to do with him.
First, Liz Cheney thinks she's entitled to whatever she wants because she's Dick Cheney's daughter.
Second, Wyoming has about ten thousand times as many tumbleweeds as it does actual people, so Cheney doesn't think victory will be hard.
In Wyoming, winning the Republican primary is pretty much a guarantee that you'll win the general—and it doesn't take much to win the primary. In 2010, which was the highest turnout Republican primary in recent years, just 110,000 people turned out to vote. In other words, Cheney realizes that even if 2014 is also a high-turnout primary, she only needs to win about 55,000 votes to become a U.S. Senator.
So while Liz Cheney running isn't good news for Mike Enzi and isn't good news for Republicans who want to avoid intraparty fights, it wouldn't take much for her to win. And that's good news for Liz Cheney—and for those of us who are easily amused by the sight of Republicans eating their own.

Want the scoop on hot races around the country? Get the digest emailed to you each weekday morning. Sign up here.

Leading Off:
• KS-Gov: A big bunch of former GOP office-holders has formed a new group to oppose the re-election of Gov. Sam Brownback, a fellow Republican. The organization includes a number of ex-legislators, many of whom were defeated in primaries last year by conservative allies of Brownback's, as well as former U.S. Sen. Sheila Frahm, who lost to Brownback himself in a 1996 primary. Brownback faces an above-average challenge from Democratic state House Minority Leader Paul Davis.


Senate:
• HI-Sen, HI-01: The Hawaii State Teachers Association has endorsed Democratic Rep. Colleen Hanabusa in her bid for Senate. The HSTA, as well as the National Education Association, is also giving its support to state Rep. Mark Takai in the wide-open Democratic primary to replace Hanabusa in the 1st District.
• LA-Sen: State Rep. Paul Hollis, who first said he was considering a bid for Senate in October, has filed paperwork with the FEC. He's the third Republican to enter the race against Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, along with Rep. Bill Cassidy and Air Force vet Rob Maness.
• MT-Sen: Montana's largest union, the 18,000-strong MEA-MFT, has endorsed Lt. Gov. John Walsh for Senate. MEA-MFT represents teachers and other state employees. Walsh faces ex-Lt. Gov. John Bohlinger in the Democratic primary.
• SD-Sen: As expected, former Republican Sen. Larry Pressler has launched his comeback bid as an independent.
Gubernatorial:
• HI-Gov: Barack Obama has endorsed Gov. Neil Abercrombie, who is seeking re-election but faces a challenge in the Democratic primary from state Sen. David Ige.
House:
• GA-01, -10, -11: Emily Cahn offers a helpful rundown on the GOP primary fields for Georgia's three open House seats.
• MN-08, NH-02: Americans for Prosperity is spending $600,000 to air ads attacking two Democrats over Obamacare, Rep. Rick Nolan of Minnesota and Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire.
• NC-07: State Sen. David Rouzer was a natural to seek a rematch against Rep. Mike McIntyre after he lost the closest House race in the country in 2012, but he may have company in the GOP primary. New Hanover County Commissioner Woody White says he's considering a bid and expects to decide by the end of January.
• NE-02: It's very thin, but Joe Jordan at the Nebraska Watchdog says that unnamed sources have told him that attorney David Domina, who had been looking at Nebraska's open Senate seat, is considering a run against GOP Rep. Lee Terry in the state's 2nd Congressional District instead. This would actually be a winnable race for Domina, and he'd also really help Democrats, who lost their only candidate when Omaha City Councilman Pete Festersen dropped out earlier this month. Domina, however, missed a self-imposed mid-November deadline to decide on a Senate bid.
• VA-10: Former Democratic Rep. Artur Davis of Alabama has declined a comeback bid under the Republican banner for the open seat of retiring GOP Rep. Frank Wolf. Meanwhile, another dweebus—reality TV clown Tareq Salahi—says he will seek the GOP nomination in Virginia's 10th. (James L & David Nir)
• TX-04: GOP Rep. Ralph Hall, at age 90 the oldest member of the House in U.S. history, says that next year's campaign will be his last.
• House: On behalf of Americans United for Change, PPP has new polls of five House districts, mostly focused on extending unemployment insurance protection. (It's broadly supported.) There are no horserace numbers, but we do have job approvals for four potentially vulnerable Republicans: Gary Miller (CA-31), Mike Coffman (CO-06), Rodney Davis (IL-13), and Dan Benishek (MI-01). (John Boehner's district was also surveyed.) Everyone is under water, but nothing dramatic.
Other Races:
• VA State Senate: GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell has scheduled the special election for Attorney General-elect Mark Herring's 33rd District state Senate seat for Jan. 21. So even if Democrats hold Lt. Gov.-elect Ralph Northam's Senate seat on Jan. 7, Republicans would still control the chamber 20-19 until the second special could be held.
Grab Bag:
• Census: Unsurprisingly, Florida is about to overtake New York to become the third most-populous state in the nation, perhaps when the Census Bureau releases new population estimates on Monday. New York, however, still has a huge edge in GDP, and ranks seventh among all states in GDP per capita. Florida is 39th.
Meanwhile, BuzzFeed has some animated GIFs showing changes in the U.S. since 1990 on the county level, based on Census data, across several different demographic categories.
• Maps: New York Times graphics editor Joshua Katz has taken his data collection on dialects to the next level, with a new quiz that tries to pinpoint where you're from, linguistically speaking, depending on your answers to a battery of questions about vocabulary and pronunciation. It had me utterly nailed as a New Yorker, but come on, people. Are you really playing tennis in those shoes? You are obviously using them for sneaking, duh!
• Money: Kent Cooper lists how much cash the 17 members of Congress who are retiring at the end of next year still have in their campaign accounts. All told, it's $13 million, with Montana Sen. Max Baucus leading the way with $3.3 million.
• SCF: One lesser-known way PACs can support candidates is by acting as pass-through entities, which means they can solicit contributions from donors who earmark them for specific campaigns. As Kent Cooper explains, the gifts count only against the contribution limits of the original donors, who get credit for making the donation; the PAC, meanwhile, gets credit for collecting the money and passing it along. (I believe this is how ActBlue operates, legally speaking.)
Cooper discusses all this in the context of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which has forwarded nearly $500,000 to four different outsider Senate candidates this year. The largest recipient has been Kentucky businessman Matt Bevin, with $304,000. Also receiving funds are Rob Maness (Louisiana), Chris McDaniel (Mississippi), and Ben Sasse (Nebraska).

Canadian-born U.S. Sen. Ted ""Calgary"" Cruz (R-TX) hasn't served a single day of his life in the United States armed services, but over the weekend that didn't stop him from accusing decorated Vietnam veterans and Obama cabinet nominees John Kerry and Chuck Hagel of being against our nation's military:
We've got two pending nominations, John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, both of whom are very prominently (moderator says ""anti-us"") less than ardent fans of the U.S. military.
The fact that a chickenhawk like Calgary Cruz would accuse actual war heroes like Kerry and Hagel of being against America is crazy enough on its own, but the substantive argument he was trying to make was just as absurd. Cruz wasn't merely trying to impugn their patriotism, he was also trying to make the case for more military spending.
According to Cruz, what America needs now is to build up American military power just like we did during the Cold War. In Cruz's view, failing to do so would project weakness to whomever it is that we are fighting. Therefore, the fact that neither Kerry nor Hagel believe it is in America's interests to continue feeding fiscal steroids to our military industry means that they must hate America and want our enemy (or is it enemies?) to win.
Obviously, Cruz's thinking isn't alone in the GOP. It's about as common as a Republican foreign policy adviser slipping up and referring to the Soviet Union or Czechoslovakia, which is to say it's pretty damn common. It might be a theory worth debating if our ""enemy"" were the Soviet Union, but whatever our enemy is, it's not the USSR or anything like it.
Nonetheless, Republicans continue to insist on the sort of outdated thinking that leads their leading politicians to say offensive things like Cruz did over the weekend and stupid things like Paul Ryan did in the vice presidential debate when he claimed the sequester's defense cuts encouraged the attack in Benghazi.
There is one good thing to come out of it, though: It's nice to see that yet another guy elected by the tea party is complaining about the spending cuts that they forced into law.

 1:37 PM PT: A few minutes ago, Cruz voted against confirming Kerry as Secretary of State. At least he has the courage of his idiotic convictions, I guess.

There is so much gold in this Wall Street Journal article about Mitt Romney's future plans that I am already giddy with anticipation:
Restless, a little wistful and sharply critical of President Barack Obama's second term, Mr. Romney said in an interview that he plans to re-emerge in ways that will ""help shape national priorities.""
His first priority is apparently going to be selling Utah timeshares—I mean, bringing his friends together for a few days of privately talking about stuff. Then it will be on to Having Opinions In Public.
As a first step, the former Republican presidential nominee plans to welcome 200 friends and supporters to a three-day summit next week that he will host at a Utah mountain resort.
He is considering writing a book and a series of opinion pieces, and has plans to campaign for 2014 candidates.

The WSJ report says the Utah Friends o' Romney Summit and Failure Emporium will be ""splashy, expensive, and closed to outsiders and the press,"" which makes it sound a bit like either a Roman orgy or a Gatsby shindig. I look forward to hearing nothing of substance about it. (If you don't think Mitt's team will be confiscating everything that even looks like a camera and throwing them all into the fires of Mt. Doom before the event begins, oh my—you and I may have a wager to make. I'm not sure they'll allow pencils.)
But don't even tempt us with the possibility of a Mitt Romney book tour. No. Watching Mitt Romney do the talk show rounds to promote a hip new policy prescription for America would be too fine a thing to ask for. Mitt's already offering great, great advice—like how the GOP needs to ""translate our message in a way that minorities understand."" (These new efforts to ""translate"" their message to minorities so far seem to be based on the usual way people attempt to communicate with ethnic people who don't seem to understand them: Say the same thing, but talk LOUDER.)
His Utah event, though, really shows just how much ol' Mitt has his finger on the pulse of Regular Guy America:
The retreat will offer some unusual extracurriculars: Skeet shooting with Mr. Ryan; golfing with Mr. Paul; horseback riding with Mitt and Ann Romney; hiking with Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman.
Oh dear Lord, thank you for this sweet bounty. ""Hiking with Meg Whitman"" should be the title of Mitt's book. Just throwing that out there.

“Tea Party forces will still win in the end,” Theda Skocpol writes, unless moderate Republicans can defeat them. Skocpol concedes that the Tea Party “will triumph just by hanging on long enough” as Americans are getting fed up by “our blatantly manipulated democracy and our permanently hobbled government.”
The article, “Why The Tea Party Isn’t Going Anywhere,” was first published in the journal Democracy, and later reprinted in The Atlantic. 
Despite the fact that Democrats, the mainstream media, and the Republican establishment again were predicting the “demise of the Tea Party” immediately after the government shutdown ended, Skocpol doesn’t believe so.
“But we have heard all this before,” she writes. “The Tea Party’s hold on the GOP persists beyond each burial ceremony.”
Skocpol and Vanessa Williamson published a book in 2011 that “showed how bottom-up and top-down forces intersect to give the Tea Party both leverage over the Republican Party and the clout to push national politics sharply to the right.”
“At the grassroots, volunteer activists formed hundreds of local Tea Parties, meeting regularly to plot public protests against the Obama Administration and place steady pressure on GOP organizations and candidates at all levels,” they found. “At least half of all GOP voters sympathize with this Tea Party upsurge.”
Though Skokpol and Williamson have their typical biases and describe the Tea Party movement as a “radical” one that may not like minorities–without any evidence of that assertion–they acknowledge that “even though there is no one center of Tea Party authority–indeed, in some ways because there is no one organized center–the entire gaggle of grassroots” and outside groups that support the movement “wields money and primary votes to exert powerful pressure on Republican officeholders and candidates.”
Skocpol observes that the “Tea Party clout has grown in Washington and state capitals” because “Americans are also losing ever more faith in the federal government.” In addition, “most legislators and candidates are Nervous Nellies,” and they have seen the Tea Party defeat establishment Republicans like Charlie Crist in Florida in 2010 and David Dewhurst in Texas in 2012 in addition to knocking off incumbent Republican Sens. Bob Bennett (R-UT) and Richard Lugar (R-IN). 
“That grabs legislators’ attention and results in either enthusiastic support for, or acquiescence to, obstructive tactics,” Skocpol writes. 
She writes how powerfully someone like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) resonates with the Tea Party. She noted that he was able to direct House Republicans to pressure House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) to demand that President Barack Obama and Democrats fund the government except for Obamacare. 
Skocpol notes that it will not be easy to defeat the Tea Party. 
“For one, at least three successive national election defeats will be necessary to even begin to break the determination and leverage of Tea Party adherents,” Skocpol writes. She concedes that Tea Partiers will not “stand down easily or very soon.”
Skocpol notes “moderate Republicans” do not have as much power in Washington or in state capitals and points to Cruz as being “very well positioned to garner unified Tea Party support in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries.” The Chamber of Commerce will reportedly spend $50 million to wage war against the Tea Party, along with Karl Rove’s American Crossroads; Skocpol believes unless those groups defeat the Tea Party, it may well win many permanent victories.
“During the last election cycle, no far-right candidate ever consolidated sustained grassroots Tea Party support, as those voters hopped from Rick Perry to Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich to Rick Santorum,” Skocpol writes. “But this time, Cruz may very well enjoy unified and enthusiastic grassroots Tea Party support from the beginning of the primary election season.”
Skocpol also sends a warning to Democrats who think that the Tea Party will fade because of a few bad polls. 
“Once the October 2013 shutdown ended in supposed total victory for President Obama and his party, many Democrats adopted a cocky swagger and started talking about ousting the House GOP in 2014,” Skocpol writes. However, she warns that “a clear-eyed look shows that Tea Party remains powerful and has achieved victories that continue to stymie” Democrats and their statist agenda. "

In her first, she highlights a little-remarked upon aspect of the 2012 Presidential campaign--that George W. Bush, ""history's actor,"" the last Republican to hold the White House, presiding over our country for eight seemingly endless years--was nowhere to be seen.
It's an appropriate introduction for Dr. Maddow. The shadow of Bush looms not only over today's Republican Party, but on all of us, and especially on Maddow herself. In a real sense she owes her career--and Markos owes the success of this site--to the depravity of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
Bush made no noteworthy appearances for any candidate in 2012. He was a non-entity at the Republican National Convention. Not even the corporate media that had fawned over his worst excesses seemed interested in what he thought--about anything. His was the ""name that shall not be named,"" terminating the lofty aspirations of his heir apparent brother and bringing the family dynasty to a screeching halt. For a two-term President to have been utterly shunted by his own Party to the silent dustbin of history is a singular accomplishment. Maddow points out that no former Bush official holds any major visible position in today's Republican hierarchy:
[B]y the time the Bush era was winding down, the whole administration, including the president, was stewed in terrible, Cheney-level disapproval ratings. And now, almost no one who played a significant role in that administration is anywhere to be found in electoral politics, beyond the tertiary orbits of Punch-and-Judy cable news and the remains of what used to be the conservative “think tank” circuit.
2012 simply cemented the consensus felt by the GOP in 2008, that the Bush name carried the toxicity and accompanying shelf-life of a nuclear meltdown:
The 2008 Republican presidential primaries were like some odd eight-year cicada hatch in which the candidates went underground in 2000 and then birthed themselves after Bush and Cheney were gone, as if the intervening years had never happened.
The Bush legacy is so tainted that it has spawned an ideological shift in a GOP that, however dimly, recognizes that the face in the rear-view mirror is too hideous for most Americans to bear.  Hence the outsized rise of the Libertarian elements in the party (perceived by Maddow as having at least the potential to win over a more youthful demographic).  But even of those, the search for viable new leaders is crippled by the wreckage left in Bush's wake.  The damage done by Bush to his own party is historic in and of itself.
She believes that the Bush experience contains a cautionary note for the Democrats as well. While President Obama's tenure is hardly likely to leave the negative blowback on the Democratic Party that Bush foisted on the GOP, the President's legacy to his Party is something he should be aware of and working on at this point in his second term.  The rise of a more progressive breed of Democrats, particularly in the Senate, ought to inspire that effort going forward.   And although hailed by the corporate soothsayers as the inevitable nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton thus far (in Maddow's eyes) simply hasn't generated the grassroots enthusiasm one would expect from the Democratic base:
Unless Vice President Biden’s presidential hinting suddenly takes a turn for the serious, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is the obvious inheritor of the party’s mantle. But, as in 2008, the Beltway may be overstating her inevitability. The grass roots aren’t all with her, frankly, and it’s yet to be seen if she’s interested in trying to win them over. Mainstream press may buy big-dollar donors (and more mainstream press), but it can’t buy the passionate volunteers and activists and excitement that are the oxygen for a winning campaign and sustained, effective leadership.
The bottom line? The President should be concerned about the legacy he leaves when he departs the Oval Office. And if Hillary is to inherit that legacy, she will first and foremost need to answer to us.

Kaboom.



Kaboom.

Just four months ago, I wrote:
True, today's deal preserved the existing filibuster rule, but it really didn't. Democrats established that they could bust through any filibuster with a simple majority anytime they wanted. Sure, it's still a process to do so, full of blustery threats and hyperbolic doomsaying, but it's a process [...]
But if Republicans continue to prevent up-or-down votes on further administration officials, or perhaps more importantly, judicial ones, Democrats now have a tool to force action. And that means we've come a long way from a few years ago, when Senate Democrats simply shrugged at the inevitability of the GOP filibuster arguing they had no other option.

I must admit, I didn't expect Republicans to challenge this notion this quickly. And the reason is simple: Even with a truncated and compromised filibuster, Republicans were able to gum up the works to unprecedented levels. As Bill Sher at the Campaign for America's Future notes, the federal judiciary is now evenly balanced, with 390 GOP-appointed judges and 391 Democratic-appointed ones. However, there are 93 vacancies.
Republicans could relent on Obama’s right to fill vacancies and keep the filibuster in place. Obama would get some more judges, but he would not be able to fill all the outstanding vacancies by next year considering that he has only identified nominees for about half of those seats. But if Republicans provoke the end of the filibuster, then I suspect the White House can quickly find another 50 or so judges without much fuss.
In other words, surrendering on three judges would've allowed the GOP to continue obstructing the other 87. Provoking the Democrats into eliminating the filibuster, on the other hand, now allows Democrats to ram all 90 through with minimal trouble. And there's no longer any need to try and find judges that can pick up a handful of Republican votes, so they should prove better ideologically. This will also take the judiciary from a 50-50 partisan split to a 55-45 Democratic-appointed one. And we still have another three years of vacancies ahead of us before we choose our next president.
So why surrender their ability to gum up the works? Is it a bet that they'll take over the chamber in the 2014 elections? Not really. A presidential veto would negate the need for minority Democrats to filibuster.
So is it a bet that Republicans will take both the Senate next year, and the White House in 2016? Perhaps. But if so, why not give proper deference for three years, relent on a handful of judges, preserve the filibuster, and then ditch it when they theoretically took power in early 2017?
None of this makes sense. Republicans have been daring Democrats to go nuclear all week, and today things went ""boom!"". But that bomb detonated over Republicans while Democrats watched from a safe bunker miles away. So what were Republicans thinking?

August 2013 is not looking a whole lot like August 2009, not where town meetings are concerned, anyway. Wednesday night, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), an ardent Obamacare foe, didn't face an adoring crowd of teabaggers there to shout their support for him and scream their hatred for Obamacare.
Instead, he got a message about the law that he probably wasn't expecting, including from the woman in the video above who lost her son to colon cancer, largely because it was caught too late. It was caught late because he didn't have insurance because of a preexisting condition, a birth defect. She wasn't the only one McHenry heard from.
They all wanted direct answers from the congressman Wednesday evening, and many of them, including Skip Edwards, questioned the Republican’s position on the Affordable Care Act.
Edwards and his wife, both 63, had health insurance until he lost his job during the recession and the East Asheville couple found themselves in financial trouble despite staying relatively healthy.
Both had pre-existing conditions and were denied insurance, making them eligible for a state plan called Inclusive Health.
“It cost us $1,300 bucks a month — extremely expensive,” Edwards said. “It taps us out every month. But at our age and health, we’ve got to have it.”

McHenry's response was typically lame—he loves the stuff about no more discriminating for preexisting conditions and allowing young people to stay on parents' plan until their 26, but didn't explain how his repeated votes to repeal and defund the law that includes those protections preserved them.
Instead, he talked about the usual stuff Republicans talk about: expanding high risk pools, ""adding 'That is more of a solution than I think that Obamacare will be,' as many in the crowd groaned."" He also said that people should be able to buy insurance across state lines, another big Republican ""solution."" Not surprisingly, ""Edwards was not satisfied with the congressman’s answer.""
That's what happens when Republicans are forced to confront the reality of actual people who really need health insurance. They've never had real answers and they've never been able to present a valid alternative. That's why we haven't heard ""repeal and replace"" since 2010; they've never had a ""replace."" It's why the answer now is ""repeal, defund, and/or shutdown government."" It's only ever been about selling the rabid base the idea that they could kill the law.
11:03 AM PT: American Bridge has released their video of the exchange between Mr. Edwards and Rep. McHenry. The audience reaction to McHenry is priceless. And it's about time he heard it.

In the wake of last week’s much-discussed New York Times investigative report detailing cronyism and mismanagement inside the Clinton Foundation, former president Bill Clinton issued an open letter in an attempt to stem the public relations backlash. Clinton’s letter challenged a couple of the Times’ assertions that his nonprofit had run deficits.
Curiously, Clinton’s letter left unchallenged the Times’ more troubling reporting–based on over two dozen interviews with Clinton Foundation insiders–that the nonprofit is rife with cronyism and conflicts of interest that leverage access and power to benefit for-profit ventures like Teneo, a consultancy co-founded by Bill Clinton’s “surrogate son” and former Clinton Foundation aide Douglas Band. Teneo, whose earliest clients included the now-defunct MF Global headed up by Obama bundler Jon Corzine, has also hired Hillary Clinton’s top aide Huma Abedin, wife of mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner.
That placed Media Matters in the awkward position of defending Hillary and Bill Clinton from the liberalNew York Times. Media Matters blogger Emily Arrowood filed a blog post chastising the New York Timesfor its “misleading Times story, which apparently failed to perform due diligence in reporting on the accounting requirements for foundations.”
Oddly, Arrowood went on to scold conservative media outlets for having the temerity to cite the New York Times reportage.
“Predictably, conservative media did not wait to learn these facts surrounding the Clinton Foundation, preferring to cite the initial Times story to decry imaginary scandals and lob both new and old attacks at Hillary Clinton,” wrote Arrowood. She blasted Fox News host Eric Bolling, The Blaze, The London Telegraph (sic), former New York Times Magazine editor-in-chief Ed Klein, and The Atlantic as being part of a “right-wing noise machine” that was “scrambling to find a new Hillary scandal.”
Like Bill Clinton’s letter, however, Arrowood’s blog post sidestepped the Times’ more serious charges of cronyism and conflicts of interest and ducked altogether the Breitbart News report last week featured on Drudge Report that chronicled additional Clinton Foundation conflicts of interest not included in theTimes’ original report. As Breitbart News reported, by 2008, the Clinton Foundation raised at least $46 million from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Brunei, Oman, and other foreign governments with whom Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would later negotiate. In her role as a New York Senator, Hillary Clinton also reportedly helped New York developer Robert Congel win millions of dollars in federal assistance after Congel donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
Then there is the case of Teneo. According to the Times, the Clintons, Band, Teneo, and the Foundation were entangled in a web of crony alliances and conflicts of interest:

Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country’s top hedge funds.
By 2011, the firm had added a third partner, Declan Kelly, a former State Department envoy for Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Clinton had signed up as a paid adviser to the firm.
Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors, while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encouraged others to become new foundation donors. Its marketing materials highlighted Mr. Band’s relationship with Mr. Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, where Mr. Band sat on the board of directors through 2011 and remains an adviser. Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.

The crony connections between Teneo, Douglas Band, and the Clintons had grown so alarming, reports theTimes, that Chelsea Clinton “became increasingly concerned with the negative impact Mr. Band’s outside business might have on her father’s work and that she cited concerns raised during the internal review about potential conflicts of interest involving Teneo.”
The Media Matters piece made no mention of Teneo, Douglas Band, Robert Congel, or Chelsea Clinton’s concerns over crony capitalist conflicts of interest.
Instead, following Bill Clinton’s lead, Media Matters dodged the New York Times‘ most serious revelations and quibbled over “context”–a risky tactic that may encourage the Times to dig deeper.
Indeed, just one day after Bill Clinton and Media Matters’s retort, liberal New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd followed up the Times’ Clinton Foundation cronyism report with this: “If Americans are worried about money in politics, there is no larger concern than the Clintons…Clintonworld is a galaxy where personal enrichment and political advancement blend seamlessly, and where a cast of jarringly familiar characters pad their pockets every which way to Sunday.”
Dowd added, “The most egregious nest of conflicts was a firm founded by Doug Band called Teneo, a scammy blend of corporate consulting, public relations and merchant banking. Band, a surrogate son to Bill, put Huma, a surrogate daughter to Hillary, on the payroll.  Even Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviser.”
No word yet from Media Matters on Maureen Dowd’s newly minted allegiance with the “right-wing noise machine.”

From the New York Times via Balloon Juice:
 
  In 2011, Mr. Christie held a news conference where he accused State Senator Richard J. Codey of being “combative and difficult” in blocking two nominees. Mr. Codey, a Democrat who had served as governor following the resignation of James E. McGreevey, responded that he had not only signed off on the nominations, but had held a meeting to try to hurry them along.
    Three days later, Mr. Codey was walking out of an event in Newark when he got a call from the state police superintendent informing him that he would no longer be afforded the trooper who accompanied him to occasional public events — a courtesy granted all former governors. That same day, his cousin, who had been appointed by Mr. McGreevey to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, was fired, as was a close friend and former deputy chief of staff who was then working in the state Office of Consumer Affairs.
    [….]
    Later that year, the governor was pressing hard on Alan Rosenthal, the Rutgers political scientist whom Republicans and Democrats had chosen as the tiebreaking member of the commission that was redistricting the state’s legislative districts. Mr. Christie wanted Mr. Rosenthal to vote for the map put forward by the Republicans on the commission, but instead he chose the Democrats’ plan, saying it offered more stability.
    Soon after, Mr. Christie used his line-item veto to cut $169,000 for two programs at Mr. Rosenthal’s institute at Rutgers.

Reading this, my sense is that the New York Times isn't actually scouring the metro area looking for anti-Christie stories, but rather the anti-Christie stories are coming to them. If that's the case, look for many more of these in the immediate future.

Beyond the media fawning over the spectacle of President Barack Obama and outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sitting down for an interview together on 60 Minutes–old rivals, reunited!–there is a message that the president wants to send. Not just the fact that Vice President Joe Biden will not be his first pick for 2016, but also the signal that Republicans ought to forget about a revival in four years: liberalism is here to stay.
Republicans seem to have concluded that their overall revival depends on finding the right candidate to win. If so, they may be in for a long wait. Clinton is so popular right now–with Republicans as well as Democrats–that she is easily the favorite to win in 2016. Freshman Rep. Tom Cotton (R-AR) welcomed her during last week’s Benghazi hearings by telling her he had wished her to win the 2008 Democratic primary; even Paul Ryan suggested on Meet the Press that a President Clinton might have solved the debt crisis by now.
Clinton’s popularity is partly due to the fact that she is so different to Obama. She is not as hostile to opposition, and gives more direct-sounding answers to tough questions, even when she is being just as evasive. She once gave the impression of being more centrist, as well, famously voting in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War–a vote that her rival punished her for on the campaign trail in 2008, claiming he would have voted differently.
In truth, there is not much daylight between the Alinskyite pair. Clinton not only carried out the Obama administration’s awful foreign policy–she did so with enthusiasm. She lectured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for 45 minutes over construction in Jewish parts of Jerusalem, for example, and launched an abortive “reset” in relations with Russia (a gesture that failed even in its theatrics; the button read “overcharge”).
Obama and Clinton are also closely bound together in the Benghazi failure, a scandal whose details are still being kept from the public, even though it is broadly clear that the White House chose not to intervene to save U.S. personnel, and at the same time engineered a cover-up in which both Obama and Clinton agreed to a fraudulent alibi that blamed the deadly attack on an anti-Islam video on YouTube that few had seen.
Yet the two have avoided accountability, since the media failed to pursue the Benghazi scandal before the election (or actively suppressed it), and now that the election is long gone, most have adopted the “what difference does it make?” attitude displayed by Clinton on Capitol Hill last week. She ought to be haunted by those words, and those four dead Americans, for the rest of her career; chances are, however, that she will not.
Obama’s joint interview was likely planned as a gesture of support and unity as the Benghazi scandal returned–however briefly–to the headlines. Yet it also serves a political purpose for the president, as he moves forward with an aggressive and confrontational agenda designed to divide and marginalize opposition and lay the foundation for radical changes, not just for the next four years but the in years beyond.
President Obama wants Republicans to know that the left’s moment is not fleeting; that the changes he makes today will be ratified by the electorate, through Clinton, in 2016 and possibly 2020; in short, that there is no hope for a resurgence and they may as well yield. Whether he succeeds may depend less on how Republicans rebuild themselves, and more on whether Biden–and other Democrats–disrupt the Obama-Clinton alliance."

Good luck reasoning with this guy

   President Obama can not force the GOP to stop destroying their own party and along with it America's economy. He can't force them to stop clinging to bad ideas that are proven to fail.
    Obama is not Ceaser Milan. He can't make the GOP stop shitting on the floor and rolling in it. He can't make the GOP stop biting people they have always hated. The GOP is a bad dog that refuses to be taught new tricks. Pretending that the President has the power to make the GOP stop embracing the massively unpopular ideas that cost them the last Presidential election is a half-assed attempt to hold Obama accountable for Republicans bad behavior instead of holding Republicans accountable for their own bad behavior. Any journalist who insists otherwise is full of it.
He's the President of the United States. He is not the Asshole Whisperer.
more below the fold . . .


A nihilistic post-policy GOP that defines themselves by opposing whatever Obama wants on any given day, even if Obama supports GOP ideas, simply can not be reasoned with. Period. They define who they are by how much that hate Obama. Good luck working with that.
Saying Obama should ""Show more leadership"" is like saying he should be more pro-active and think outside the box, its' meaningless bullshit designed to shift the blame from the hardline psychosis of the GOP onto the President, who somehow has the power to make Republicans stop acting insane but just won't use it. And I will remind you that nearly every hack journalist that is saying Obama should ""Show more leadership"" are the same people who praised Bush's leadership while he was creating the problems that Congressional Republicans refuse to allow Obama to address in any way at all.
This diary started as a tweet and deserved more, but the title explains itself. Barack Obama is the President of the United States, he is not the Asshole Whisperer. He can not force Republicans to abandon a set of policies that has destroyed their own brand, nor can he force them to abandon a set of policies that even the Pope is against at this point. Obama can not force the GOP to grow up and moderate from the platform Romney/Ryan lost so badly on, but maybe, just maybe, if those journalists calling on Obama to ""show leadership"" would explain to their audiences how and why the GOP are filibustering everything they can just to defeat Obama despite the pain it causes average Americans, maybe that would help. But who the hell am I kidding, that would require lazy journalists to place blame on Congressional Republicans, and that just isn't going to happen anytime soon.
So we have a broken Government that can do nothing because that is how Mitch McConnell and John Boehner like it. Blaming Obama on Republicans being Republicans is just stupid. Maybe instead of holding Obama accountable for Congressional Republicans bad behavior we could try doing what Ceaser Milan does, and by that I mean that every time Congressional Republicans shit the floor journalists should rub John Boehner's nose in it instead of looking at Obama like it is his fault that Republican Cujo predictably mauled the economy again.

Oh. Oh dear. (Right Wing Watch)

Oh, heavens, whatever shall become of our fair republic:
Approximately 100 conservative activists gathered in front of the White House on Tuesday for a kickoff of what organizers call ""the second American revolution.""
The event could easily have been mistaken for a tea party rally, with American and Gadsden flags, a smattering of biker jackets and a few lawn chairs.
Freedom Watch founder Larry Klayman, who emceed the event, told attendees if President Barack Obama does not resign by Nov. 29, conservative activists will meet in Philadelphia to elect a shadow government.

Two people per state? That's not a revolution, that's a Senate. If this shadow government is going to contain a full House as well, they're going to have to start appointing pets and toasters.
You have probably heard of Larry Klayman before. If not, no worries—but I should clarify that this is the loudmouthed neorevolutionary wingnut that has not been arrested for possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms, not the one who has. Yes, it can get confusing. While the other revolutionary is all about being able to carry guns wherever you want because you never know when the mushrooms will kick in, this one is still on the whole Obama is possibly a Kenyan kick, plus also ""Benghazi-gate"" and the shutting down of our precious war memorials, etc., and so forth.
Alright, so Mr. Klayman has said that if President Obama does not resign by the sacred date of Black Friday, he and other likeminded crackpots will immediately meet, perhaps on what shall henceforth be known as Honky Saturday, to elect their own shadow government. One that is not from Kenya, and is not a secret Musslim and so forth:
Bishop Dan Johnson of the Heart of Fire Church in Louisville, Ky., prayed with ralliers, asking God to ""cause [elected officials] to get on their knees, not to Allah, but to God almighty."" In his prayer, Johnson denounced homosexuality, permissive parenting, pornography and welfare.
In addition to a bewigged George Washington impersonator and the editor of conspiracy website World Net Daily Joseph Farah because, well, duh, there was also a former congressman on hand to lend the proceedings another few shovelfuls of skin-crawling creepiness.
""We have a scoundrel living in that building,"" [Former Rep. Bob Barr] said, pointing at the White House, ""and need to do something about it.""
Ew, I thought that fellow had died. I suppose he might have, and his speech could have just been gas escaping—please get on that hypothesis, Mr. Farah, America demands an answer.
So there you go: the revolution is upon us, at least once they decide between Denny's and Olive Garden for the ceremonies. Never have so few given so little to scream so loudly—true patriots, all. Someday each one of them will be commemorated on trading cards, a little paperboard sea of revolutionary flags and trucker hats.
God speed, heroes, and remember to leave the 'shrooms at home.

The run-up to the 2014 Congressional elections is in full swing. You can be sure that Republicans are sharpening their talking points for the upcoming campaigns. We’ll likely be hearing all about a supposed lackluster economy, tepid employment picture, and that demonic “Obamacare.” Now is the time, therefore, for Democrats and progressives to hone their arguments and talking points to counter those of the Republicans and, better yet, to drive the conversation from the get-go. Here are three words to use against the Republicans:
“They Did Nothing.” It’s that simple. The Republicans on the economy? “They did nothing.” On jobs? “They did nothing.” Rebuilding America’s crumbling roads and bridges to help businesses move their products? “They did nothing.” Immigration? “They did nothing.” Bringing American jobs back home instead of shipping them overseas? “They did nothing.” Keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill? “They did nothing.”* The list goes on and on. And to be clear, the Democrats must articulate their positive agenda. In fact, President Obama has taken to the road to do just that. Saying the Republicans did nothing only makes sense if Democrats clearly explain what solutions they stand for and on which the Republicans should work, with some compromise and cooperation by both sides.
Surely, you say, Republicans and conservatives will argue that their lawmakers have done something, and we need to be prepared for that defense. Okay, here’s what Republicans in Congress have done: abortion bills.  Votes to repeal “Obamacare.” Phony ""scandals."" Budgetary hostage taking. Filibustering and blocking even the basic functions of our democracy. That’s during the few days in between their lengthy taxpayer-paid vacations when they’re even in session. And if you want to see what the extreme Republicans (yes, ""extreme"" should be used frequently to modify ""Republican"") do when they have the votes, look no further than Republican-run states like Texas.
So feel free to begin the 2014 election argument. You have a good one to make.
*If you use the phrase out of context, such as on a bumper sticker, simply replace “They” with “Republicans.”

It's been a long time coming, but Tea Baggin' Conferderates Secessionist Slavery Deniers are coming openly out of the closet more and more as time goes on.
There have been numerous examples from South Carolina's (Now) Lt. Governor Glenn McConnell posing with mock-slaves in a Civil War Uniform during the ""Southern Experience"" event for the National Federation of Republican Women. Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell's Celebration of ""Confederate Day"", Texas Governor Rick Perry's not-so-veiled threats of secession to the Rand Paul Staffer who called himself the ""Confederate Avenger"".
[Just as an aside, I have my doubts that McConnell is actually wearing a Southern Uniform, it's Blue and that was the color of the Union Army. Edit: Nope, It's Confederate]
And yet, there's more.


Let's not let revisionism discolor what this was really all about.  In it's letter of Secession, which was sent immediately after the Election of President Abraham Lincoln, even before he took Office, Texas stated the following:
We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.
That in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states

It was merely the election of a President from a Party that endorsed Abolition, even if that President at the time DID NOT make accomplishing that party of his platform or an agenda item of his administration - that drove the South in a complete overreaction to losing an Election to begin to dismantle the nation State by State.
And now today we see more and more Tea Partiers - while also overreacting to an election they lost - slowly endorsing the legitimacy of a new secession and further - of ABSOLUTE rights of the BUSINESS OWNER over their EMPLOYEES (as well as CLIENTS) in everything from denying them a living wage and working conditions to Dictating Whether they can have access to Preventive Services in their HealthCare, impose llfetime caps, and openly discriminate against those who had the temerity to previously GET SICK.  
Apparently Modern Confederate Tea Partiers think the cruelty of that system is just ""Fine"".
Wither is Freedom then, eh?









In the last few years there have been a rising of Pro-Confederacy Groups who've written such amazing revisionist history such as this.
Southerners have less reason to be loyal to the collective enterprise that is the United States than does any group of citizens.  The South was Invaded, laid waste, and conquered when it tried to uphold the original and correct meaning of the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.
Yeah, right, the South was ""Invaded"" - so much for those pesky letters of Secesion and that little Ft Sumter thing. Sure.
And this happened merely because they felt they had the economic Right to continue practices such as this.

Slavery was Evil.  It was pure Economic Evil.  Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit.  The Confederates were trying to Protect and Continue that system of Cruelty, of The THEFT of Freedom, Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.
But this is what they are, what they've always been.  They know it in their hearts, and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama.  It is beyond their comprehension that he isn't racked with a deep desire for Vengence against Whites.
How could it not be?

It was this type of deep atavistic fear that even affected Barack Obama's own grandmother, Toot.  In his book, Dreams from my Father he recounts how his grandmother while working in Texas following WWII had befriended a black janitor, Mr. Reed, who worked in the same building.  They had a cordial friendship, yet another - white - secretary working in the building proceeded to angrily scold them both for their familiarity telling Toot she should never, ever ""call no Nigger 'Mister'"".
Years later in Hawaii, when Barack was a boy living with his grandparents to attend High School in the U.S. while his mother worked overseas, his grandmother encountered a particularly aggressive beggar who frightened her.  A black beggar.  Despite knowing the character of Barack's father, and of Barack himself - she was still terrified of him because she knew and had seen in Texas the kind of cruel mis-treatment people like him had received.  She had a understanding of the righteous anger that that person could potentially feel, and she feared it.
That beggar was not Mr. Reed.  But another 20 years later, it very well could have been - and he would have be duly justified in his outrage.  Gramps - Toot's husband - angrily scolded her for her reaction to the beggar, his feeling had always been the individuals are individuals not some collective mass of angst, not some open racial sore that refuses to be healed.  For all of this, Barack had a ring-side seat.  He witnessed both Yin and Yang.
Unlike Toot who was sympathetic to those who suffered from bigotry, identified with their outrage - and recognized it's legitimacy - what the Modern Tea Party-Confederate feels is something worse.  
Guilt!
No, not their own personal guilt, but the collective guilt of centuries of cruelty.  They constantly try to wipe it away, ignore it, deflect it, disguise it, but it continues to come right back because they in their own heart of hearts simply don't believe that any Nigger should ever, EVER be called ""Mr. President"".
It's fear driven by that guilt that also drove the Confederates, as it drives the Tea Party, and now- the Republican Party.
So of course, they have to Do Anything Necessary to prevent this cruel retribution from being inflicted on the Good White people... um, I mean the American People. They have to SHUTDOWN THE GOVERNMENT, because that is the limited leverage they have with a majority in the House.
They have to rail that Obamacare is a Complete and Total Failure even as Hundreds of Thousands successfully send in their applications despite initial website glitches, and are finding they can get better care for far less than they were previously spending.
They have to DENY Reality, again and again and again.
Obama was never a Slave.  None of his Ancestors, on his father's side, were Slaves.  Most of what he knows about what it means to be historically ""Black In America"" came from his White Grandparents and their experiences during the 40's and the 50's as recounted to him.  He has studied Langston Hughes and Baldwin and W.E.B. Debois to better understand the ""Black Experience"".  He lived it within his own skin, in LA whlie attending Occidental College, in New York while working for a Non-Profit, in Chicago working with communities to help incrimentally improve their lives.  He's seen it from just about every possible angle, and he's not racked with Anger
He's not driven to seek Devine Retribution against the Ills of the White Race.
ObamaCare is not Punishment for the Wickedness of Long Dead White People.  Some of those White people, going all the way back to the Revolutionary War, are his own Ancestors.
Obama is not a Kenyan.  Not a Socialist.  Not a Muslim.  Not a Mau Mau Anti-Colonialist. Not a Fist Pumping Black Power Enthusiast. He's not Mr. Reed, nor is he the Beggar.
He's our American President.  He's doing the best he can, under his power, to improve the lives of All American Citizens.  As did President Lincoln before him.
Some day the Tea Party-Confederates will learn that lesson.  But apparently, not today.

Senate Republicans aren't just forcing all night sessions to exact their revenge on Democrats for invoking the nuclear option and ending the filibuster on nominations, they've escalated the fight to preventing the Judiciary Committee from even meeting.
Under a rarely enforced Senate rule, committees can't meet more than two hours after the Senate goes into session. Routinely, senators give unanimous consent to waive the rule so the committee can carry out the chamber's—and the country's—business. But today, Republicans refused unanimous consent to let the Judiciary Committee meet.
The committee has a busy schedule, with votes scheduled for 15 judicial nominees who have testified before the members and answered follow-up written questions. Among those are nominees for vacancies designated as judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. Each one of the nominees has been fully vetted and has the support of their home state senators, including Republicans Mark Kirk (IL), Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran (KS), Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker (TN), Roy Blunt (MO), and Pat Toomey (PA). [...]
If the committee is not able to meet until next week—the last week the Senate is expected to be in session—and Republicans force the nominees to be held over, then they'll be stuck in committee at year's end. Since that will be the end of a session of Congress, absent unanimous consent to do otherwise, Senate rules require the nominees to be sent back to the president for renomination in the next session. That would force all of these nominees to repeat the committee voting process all over again, where once again the GOP could find new ways to slow them down.

Can anyone doubt that Republicans will continue to do anything they can to force these nominations to expire before the end of the year? They'll do whatever possible to block these nominees for as long as possible. This means that Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), chair of the Judiciary Committee, is going to have to be willing to establish new rules, or ignore existing ones as much as is in his power to do so.
That's going to include ending the ""blue-slip"" tradition. That's the tradition of asking the home state senators of a nominee to support the nomination by signing off on a ""blue slip."" Leahy says that he intends to continue to honor the tradition because he ""assume[s] no one will abuse the blue slip process like some have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial nominees on the floor of the Senate."" If they're going to abuse the rules to keep his committee from meeting, they're going to abuse blue slips. Leahy is going to have to act to allow his committee to function again.

So Much have been written here on Daily Kos about ALEC and how the Koch brothers breath life into the very evil soul of this right-wing machine that is poised to destroy the very democracy we have aspired for in this country.
What is written for the most part is second hand salvos coming from some who were told by others or news articles that make good and disturbing readings. Today however, I read
the article I am posting here in my city newspaper.
It is written by State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison)...who was there, ""at the American Legislative Exchange Council conference, the nation's most influential conservative policy organization (""ALEC"".

I wrote Rep. Taylor an email asking for permission to post in its entirety what she personally saw. This is not second hand news.
Here is her response:
Please feel free to post on your website.
Thank you.
Patrick Walsh
Legislative Aide
Representative Chris Taylor
(608) 266-5343

(Here is what she saw, in her own words).
I recently donned a conservative blue suit and suppressed my political ideals to attend an American Legislative Exchange Council conference, the nation's most influential conservative policy organization. As a Wisconsin Democratic legislator, I was able to see the ALEC agenda in action.
ALEC is mostly funded by large corporations. While most legislators who attended the conference received corporate funded ""scholarships"" covering their travel, hotel, conference registration and food, I forked over nearly $1,000 out of pocket to become a member of ALEC and attend its 40th anniversary conference in Chicago in August.
ALEC is a ménage à trois of wealthy corporations, conservative think tanks and right-wing state legislators. I was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by the degree ALEC policy infests our country, maximizing corporate profits and free reign. One keynote speaker, Wall Street Journal columnist and Club for Growth founder Stephen Moore, summed it up: ""What we really need is more rich people.""
ALEC develops model bills on ""free market"" topics that legislative members introduce in their states. State legislators, corporations and conservative think tank members comprise task forces that create model bills. Corporate money coughed up in exchange for task force membership greases ALEC's wheels. As a result, private members run the ALEC show. In rare instances where state legislators raised concerns about policy positions, I witnessed think tank representatives and corporate lobbyists shoot them down.
The Citizens for Self-Governance, a special-interest group that ALEC promotes, demonstrated how the process works. Legislators were entreated to organize to ""save the Republic"" by amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the Supreme Court and otherwise drastically limit the power of the federal government. In exchange, we were promised the support of a grass-roots army of tea party activists and home-school advocates in addition to bundled campaign contributions.
ALEC is well underway to privatizing public education. According to the Center for Media and Democracy, in 2013, 139 ALEC model bills to fund private and religious schools with taxpayer money were introduced throughout the nation. At the education task force meeting, the pro-voucher American Federation for Children boasted 20 states now funding some form of private school K-12 vouchers.
Other model bills aim to gut workers' wage protection and benefits, limit collective bargaining rights, limit your rights to sue and curb states' power to regulate certain professions.
ALEC advances these policies shrouded in secrecy, with no public list of corporate members. Photo ID, name badges and sign-in sheets at every event rigidly controlled conference participation. I saw only one outside press camera during the entire conference. Although ALEC members insist on accountability and transparency in the public realm, they loathe it when applied to their own influence over legislation.
But ALEC has an Achilles heel. An ALEC think tank member solicited my opinion about a constitutional amendment strategy requiring congressional approval of federal regulations. I replied that I didn't think it would inspire people to amend the U.S. Constitution. He explained that with Republican domination in so many states, and guaranteed corporate support, the consent of the people is unnecessary.
This is where democracy can win over special interest influence. In ALEC nation, people are irrelevant and democracy a burden. When the people's interests are truly represented by policy-makers, and the origin of bills exposed, ALEC fails.
ALEC's corporate funders, who are also campaign donors to many ALEC members, have shrouded themselves in secrecy for this reason. ALEC cannot otherwise exist. Concerned policy-makers and the public must ensure that ALEC's promotion of corporate profits over the needs of actual people leads to the downfall of ALEC nation.
State Rep. Chris Taylor (D-Madison) will soon introduce the ALEC Accountability Act into the Wisconsin Legislature. Before being elected to the Assembly, Taylor, an attorney, served as public policy director for Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin.

346,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/03/04/1191536/-The-American-Left-is-WINNING,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,The American Left is WINNING. Updated x1,"

From Stanford University's Hoover Institution Policy Review, an article by Tod Lindberg titled, Left 3.0 - Obama and the Emergence of a Newer Left:
The left side of the American political spectrum has undergone an extraordinary transformation over the past dozen years. Perhaps because it remains a work in progress, the extent of this transformation has gone largely unremarked and seems underappreciated even among those who have been carrying it out. Forty years after the forces of the “New Left” managed to deliver the Democratic presidential nomination to their preferred candidate, George McGovern, only to see him lose the general election to Richard Nixon in a 49-state landslide, the United States is home to a newer Left. Its political hopes repose not in a man able to muster less than 40 percent of the vote nationwide, but in the convincingly reelected president of the United States, Barack Obama. This newer Left is confident in itself, united both in its description of the problems the country faces and in how to go about addressing them. This Left is conscious of itself as a movement, and believes it is on the rise. It has already managed to reshape American politics, and its successes so far have hardly exhausted its promise. Policies are changing under its influence. And its opponents do not seem to have found an effective way to counter it politically.
...
Obama staked his legacy on patching the largest remaining hole in the New Deal social welfare safety net. Guaranteed lifelong access to affordable health care has been at the top of the Left’s policy agenda since fdr. Bill Clinton tried, failed, gave up for good. Obama would not give up. Despite an economy that continued to sputter contrary to his own expectations and those of his advisors, despite public opinion polls that early turned against the reform effort, despite ominous electoral signals, and despite having to abandon the Left’s cherished “public option,” he persisted. And he prevailed. It was a political risk on the order of the one Ronald Reagan took in cooperating with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker’s successful effort to wring inflation out of the economy in 1981–82 at the cost of a brutal recession. Obama lost Democrats their House majority in doing so. Not that they thought it would happen, but in the view of many on the Left, health care reform on the scale Obama was able to achieve, though imperfect, would be worth losing a House majority. The remainder of Obama’s first term would be a domestic policy desert if not worse, entailing various capitulations to the gop, at least in the eyes of many on the Left at the time. But he had his signature achievement, subject to validation by the Supreme Court and the ability to sustain enough Democratic political power in Washington to prevent its repeal.
...
The new media environment has been very favorable to Left 3.0. Vibrant websites abound, some of them extraordinarily influential: The “netroots” have been a formidable force. The sorting of the political parties into left and right has an analogue in the sorting of the consumption of political opinion. It has never been easier to avoid encountering opinions with which one might disagree. The effect of this on the Left side of the political spectrum has helped promote the solidarity of Left 3.0 and the Democratic Party: The victors in the internal political debate were those advocating for “the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party.”

I think it goes without saying, in that last paragraph, Mr. Lindberg is pretty much referring to Daily Kos. :)
The entire article is well worth the read. It describes the ways in which Republicans, thanks largely to right-wing radio, are currently incapable of unifying in the way that Democrats have. Unfortunately, the article appears in the final issue of Policy Review, which is ceasing publication.
Giant h/t to thinkprogress.org for finding and reporting on this article. They summarize it better than I could:
Lindberg argues that the latest iteration of the left has transcended its past ideological divisions to put forth a practical, technologically sophisticated, and politically viable set of ideas tempered by expectations of slow but steady progress. What holds the left together in Lindberg’s analysis? “[T]he achievement of a greater degree of economic equality by means of politics.”
http://thinkprogress.org/...
It may be hard to appreciate how full of win we are in the wake of Sequestration. But think about it: The GOP detonated the sequester bomb because their last desperate hope is to quasi-treasonously harm America and pray the electorate blames President Obama. I believe the strategy will backfire, Dems will retake the House next year, and then, finally, as Lindberg predicts, things will start to get better quickly.
Update 1:
Salon has a post about the Lindberg article. They close with this:
Journalism, it is said, is the first draft of history. It remains to be seen whether the basic argument of “Left 3.0” is borne out in the years and decades to come.  Speaking of history, it was Hegel who observed that “The owl of Minerva flies at dusk” — by which he meant that one can only understand an epoch retrospectively, when it is over or almost over. This may explain why the best essay ever published by the conservative journal Policy Review appeared in its final issue, discussing the end of conservatism as we have known it and the rise of American liberalism in a new form.

If it's going to take a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, count Oregon in. On Monday, it became the 16th state to call on Congress to pass an amendment overturning that 2010 decision.
The bipartisan measure passed the state House by a 48-11 margin, with 14 Republican votes (the majority of state House Republicans), and the state Senate by a 17-13 margin, with one Republican, Senator Betsy Close (R-Albany), voting in favor. [...]
Oregon joins four other states – Delaware, Maine, West Virginia and Illinois – that have called for a constitutional amendment over just the past two months. All of the resolutions this year have passed with bipartisan support in at least one chamber. This is an issue that affects every American, regardless of political affiliation.
The other states that have called for an amendment to overturn Citizens United are California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, Maryland, Colorado and Montana. The Washington, D.C., Council has called for an amendment as well.

Getting corporate money out of politics is the key to restoring a healthy democracy, to electing public officials who care more about their voting constituents than their donating constituents, and to seeing nine Supreme Court justices who care more about the rule of law than the rule of the dollar. Most of Oregon's congressional delegation—U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and U.S. Reps. Earl Blumenauer, Peter DeFazio and Kurt Schrader—are cosponsoring resolutions to overturn Citizens United. Are your representatives?

You know the Republicans have really stepped in it when even folks in Utah
(where President Obama garnered just under 25 percent of the vote in 2012) begin to turn against you.
According to a new Deseret News/KSL poll, 56 percent of Utahns disagreed it was worth shutting down the government over Obamacare and just 37 percent agreed. The poll also showed that almost half of those surveyed disapprove of the tea party's influence on the shutdown, and more than one-third disapprove of Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who won his 2010 race with 62 percent of the vote.


Of course, this being ruby-red Utah, 21 percent of voters blame Obama for the shutdown. What's interesting is that nearly as many--20 percent--blame Republicans. Only 6 percent blamed Congressional Democrats, while 41 percent placed the blame on both parties equally.
These polling results out of a rock-solid red state are probably not what Congressional GOP leaders had in mind when they embarked on this folly. The write-up on the KSL web site includes some choice quotes that should send shivers down GOPers' spines:
Utahns are conservative but pragmatic. Utahns expect effectiveness and efficiency and results out of their government, not ideological tantrums.""
     Kirk Jowers, head of the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics
There is no question that Mike Lee got some name identification from what he's doing. He needs to watch his negatives because he could be vulnerable if he seeks re-election...I believe the tea party is not as strong in Utah as many political consultants felt.
     Pollster Dan Jones
When you come right down to it, the people of Utah are about common sense. This Mike Lee kind of extremism, shutting down the government because I don't get my way, just doesn't play in Utah.
     State Democratic Party Chairman Jim Dabakis
Dabakis goes on to note that while Lee's favorables are plunging, the state's only nationally elected Democrat, Rep. Jim Matheson, enjoys favorables of 57-29.
Lee, the co-author of the current shut-down crisis, claims to be utterly unconcerned with how his antics are playing back home. telling the news station the only numbers he cares about are the percentages of residents ""feeling the negative effects"" of Obamacare.
I am here in Washington working to pass bills that will fund the government and protect our citizens from harmful policy. I am going to continue to fight for Utahns and let others worry about polls.

Since the 2010 midterm elections, conservatives have looked to Speaker Boehner and House Republicans to provide a vanguard against Obama’s radical agenda. It has been a disheartening experience. In fairness to House Republicans, there is little one legislative chamber can do to affect the direction of the federal government. The tools they do have, however, they have often declined to use. Paul’s filibuster of the Brennan nomination on Wednesday, however, showed the emergence of a new opposition to Obama. Based in the Senate, it is providing the American public a stark contrast to Obama’s ever-expanding government. 
Paul’s filibuster was not based on a traditional partisan issue. Its goal was simply to clarify that the President did not have the authority to assassinate American citizens, on domestic soil, who are suspected of cooperating with terrorists. Such clarity ought not require a 13 hour filibuster. The event, however, exposed the public to a reasoned articulation of conservative, constitutional principles. It was a brilliant counter-point to Obama’s doctrine of expanding government power in every direction. 
On Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio joined Sen. Ted Cruz in announcing his opposition to any continuing resolution funding the government that didn’t also defund ObamaCare. House Republicans have long since given up this fight, passing a continuing resolution this week that continues to fund ObamaCare’s expansion. Sixteen House Republicans bucked their leadership and opposed the move, but enough Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure. 
With this week’s moves, the center of political gravity has shifted to an emerging band of leaders in the Senate. Sens. Paul, Rubio, and Cruz are providing the nucleus of a new and robust conservative opposition to the Obama Administration. They will likely lose most of their battles. Unlike House Republicans, however, they understand that their primary responsibility is to articulate to the American public an alternative vision for the country. It requires one to pick an occasional battle and present one’s case to the public. 
House Republicans are obsessive about “governing,” even though they lack the levers of power to do so. They would rather put off an ideological fight on principle in order to pass legislation. This may make sense tactically, but strategically it’s a losing bet. Worse, it denies the American public a clear choice. A party ought to articulate why it should be entrusted with legislative power. 
Sens. Paul, Rubio and Cruz understand this. They are providing the tip of the spear ahead of the 2014 midterms. Based on initial responses to Paul’s filibuster this week, they will have an army behind them.

The answer, apparently, is more town halls.



The answer, apparently, is more town halls.

Michele Bachmann has gone from presidential ""contender"" (yeah, we're just gonna put some quotes around that one) to being in serious jeopardy of losing even her current House seat. That's not entirely surprising, of course: Even though she's in a deep-red district, she's been nearly booted a few times, and her recent race against Democrat Jim Graves turned out to be a squeaker. Then there's her presidential campaign being investigated by the FEC and FBI. Oh, and the bit where she keeps saying crackpot things and being a general embarrassment to her own party.
What's a bit different is that Bachmann seems to be keenly aware of how much difficulty she's already in. Which means her constituents are going to start seeing her a lot more often:
Bachmann declined to be interviewed for this story. Kotman, her spokesman, said: “It’s 18 months out, and she isn’t focused on the campaign. She’s focused on the district.” […]
Bachmann recently began running TV commercials highlighting her role in sponsoring legislation to repeal Obama’s health care bill — an unusually early time in the election season to start airing ads. And Republicans say they’re assured by the congresswoman’s busy in-district schedule — as of late, she seems more focused on holding town halls than on making headlines.
“She is working harder in the district than she has in the past,” said Ron Carey, a former Bachmann chief of staff. “It’s going to be harder to make the case that she’s an AWOL congresswoman.”

There's nothing that shows you're ""focused on your district"" more than cutting television ads highlighting yourself and your quixotic obsession with holding dozens and dozens of meaningless votes to repeal ObamaCare. She's a true saint, that one. (Oh, and her office has also already produced an anti-Graves, anti-Nancy Pelosi web video. Again, though, not focused on campaigning. Shame on you for thinking so.) Still, having your constituents hear more from you is a bit of a risky move, for far-right Republicans like Bachmann; the entire 2012 election season was ample enough evidence of that.
Having her constituents actually boot her should still be considered an uphill climb. It's at least a bit interesting, though, that her office seems already to be in a bit of panic.

“Al, you set an example for this country that is going to live as long as recorded history, about the man who won by a decision that I think constitutional scholars now and in the future will conclude was an ill-fated decision,” Biden said. “The way you stepped up, it was amazing.”
This is pretty amazing stuff coming from a sitting Vice-President--to take a hammer to the very legitimacy of the prior Administration.  Don't think we've ever seen anything quite like that before.  Of course, it also helps when it happens to be true.
Nor did the Biden stop there.   He characterized the divide between Democrats and the modern Republicans, once merely differentiated by competing principles, as akin now to an unbridgeable abyss.
It’s a pretty simple proposition: The United States of America, and the state of Massachusetts, does not need another Republican in the Senate,” Biden said, also according to the pool report. “I’m being straight about this. This is not your father’s Republican Party. It really is a fundamentally different party. There’s never been as much distance, at least since I’ve been alive, distance between where the mainstream of the Republican congressional party is and the Democratic Party is. It’s a chasm. It’s a gigantic chasm.

And still more of the knife did the Biden twist:
[T]he last thing in the world we need now is someone who will go down to the United States Senate and support [Texas freshman Sen.] Ted Cruz, support the new senator from Kentucky—or the old senator from Kentucky,"" Biden said, referring to freshman Sen. Rand Paul and veteran Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
“Think about this,” he said. “Have you ever seen a time when two freshman senators are able to cower the bulk of the Republican Party in the Senate? That is not hyperbole.”

Yow!

This could be your next flag soon unless you act. Seriously.



This could be your next flag soon unless you act. Seriously.

Historian Bruce Bartlett wrote an interesting post in The New York Times' Economix column, underscoring how the far right's apparent desire to force an actual default has deep historical roots - roots that seem to trace back to the same origins of the know-nothingism that is at the source of Tea Party nuttiness - the U.S. Civil War. Bartlett, a key supply-side economics advisor in both Reagan and G.H.W. Bush administrations, is hardly a left-wing firebrand, so you have to take his assessment very seriously.
What Bartlett's post underscores for me is that we are in the middle of what Tea Party advocates seem hope is nothing less than the destruction of The United States of America itself- a goal that has been fomenting since the formation of our nation.
More after the break.


Bartlett points out that the southern states were very angry about the U.S. requirement not to honor the debt of the Confederate States of America after the war, which triggered concerns that the south would try to get the U.S. to do likewise with its debt as southern representative re-entered Congress after the war. The result was the 14th amendment, which, in addition to codifying the abolition of slavery, included in its Section 4 the guarantee to honor all U.S. debts.
The fact that the debt issue was stuck in the face of the southern states in the same constitutional amendment as slavery abolition civil rights guarantees should not go unnoticed for either its symbolic value or for its roots as a point of contention with the Tea Party, which draws upon white resentments in the south and elsewhere fueled by the rise of civil rights laws in the 1960s. The Tea Party draws on white supremacist sentiment that has been a part of U.S. history since its beginnings, augmenting it with pro-Nazi sentiments fueled by the so-called Fellowship Foundation of ""key men"" (and, sometimes, women) starting in the mid-20th century. Their purpose is completely clear; split the U.S. so that it can be destroyed, and replaced with a far right police state benefiting a few elites.
As with the rise of Hitler during Germany's Weimar Republic, the Tea Party uses economic and social chaos to fuel its rise. It undermines faith in democratic processes at every turn, so that people will favor ""strong man"" governments - governments that will benefit the ""key men"" first and foremost and further the redistribution of wealth from average people to the elites. The Nazis of Weimar Germany also used resentment against Europe and moderate Germans for the perceived unfairness of war reparation payments after World War I to fuel nationalism, much in the same way that the Tea Party fuels resentment against the fall of the ""Southern Cause"" with its encouragement of Confederate flag-waving and the use of the proxy Gadsden Flag from South Carolina's troops in the War of Independence.
What we are engaged in is not an economic fight, or even a political fight. What we're engaged in is in fact a fight for the last chance for a democracy in the United States for the foreseeable future. The billionaire lords of the Tea Party. like the industrialists backing Hitler, want to wage economic and military war on anyone who might interfere with their accretion of wealth, both in this nation and beyond. Their ""values"" issues, while certainly a part of their outlook, are largely tools for a much more agnostic and pagan goal: power and wealth for its own sake, with the state as the crowning mechanism for their goals.
Sadly, I don't think that the U.S. public really gets this - or really gets that they are in a battle where they are still the majority against this hardened and fantasy-based group of extremists. Hitler rose to power in part because everyday people became exhausted, beaten down by harsh economic realities, a beating aided and abetted by a flaccid and complacent media. So it is again today. Little has been learned in a century, unfortunately, it would seem.
We do have hope and we do have options, but people are tired, and they need to feel that they have hope. This is what's lacking in the political dialogue right now. Obama is doing his best to fuel that courage and that hope, but it will take a lot more grass roots activism to overcome the Tea Party. They can command endless hours of news coverage simply by having a few of their relatives and friends wave Confederate flags in front of the White House. They call for massive rallies that never materialize - except in the news media's perception that declaring these things to be so makes them so.
We have to create our own reality for the sake of U.S. democracy, and soon, otherwise there will be no union left to save. If that seems to be an exaggeration, look at how the German people allowed democracy to slip away from their own nation. The fact of the matter is that, one way or another, we are still engaged in a great Civil War for American democracy, testing whether this nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure, as Abraham Lincoln put it. The enemies of democracy laid down their arms only in part more than 150 years ago. The final battle of that war is upon us. It is up to us as a people to decide how to fight it, but the fight has been brought to us regardless. We have only to choose how to respond.
Let's hope for the best - and fight for it.

They still don't understand what the hell is wrong with you people



They still don't understand what the hell is wrong with you people

Thank whatever deity you pray to, or none at all, that these wretched people are nowhere near the White House.
In their first interview since the Great Shellshocking of 2012, Mitt and Ann allow Chris Wallace into one of their many homes so they can wax philosophical about the defeat everyone outside of their delusional bubble knew was coming, and Ann takes this opportunity to assure us that yes, she's still quite disappointed in you people for not seizing the great opportunity to let her husband regularly insult you from the Oval Office.
Wallace joins them in La Jolla, which is in California, which is, as Mitt informed us during the election, almost as much of a hellhole as Europe because taxes. Which is why he owns a beach front mansion there, of course. That would be the beach front mansion they're turning into a bigger beach front mansion, complete with car elevator, with the assistance of the private lobbyist they hired to fast-track their construction plans, like all totally normal average Americans do.
Yeah, don't you miss these people so much? If you do, head below the fold for lots of delusions, plus Ann's tear of sorrow for you people.


So what has Ann been doing with her time since she stopped traveling around the country to tell you people what ingrates you are for not appreciating her husband? She's been crying, of course—big fat crocodile tears of sorrow for you and your missed opportunity:
ANN ROMNEY: It was a crushing disappointment. Not for us. Our lives are going to be fine. It's for the country.
WALLACE: Is it true you began to cry?
ANN ROMNEY: I did, of course. Yes. Very disappointed.

Ann and her eleventy billion houses and her fancy horse and her two Cadillacs will be just fine, thank you very much, but as for the rest of the country ... Ann weeps for you. A lot:
WALLACE: So let me ask you about the months from November until now, were there tears?
ANN ROMNEY: Oh, for me, yes. I cried. When you pour that much of your life and energy and passion into something and you're disappointed by the outcome, it's very -- it's sad. It's very hard.

Remember, those tears of self-pity, because it's very hard to lose, are not for her. They're for you, America. For you.
WALLACE: Mrs. Romney, as we sit here right now, have you gotten over the defeat? Or is that going to take more time?
ANN ROMNEY: I think it takes time. I think I'm mostly -- you know, the great ""Princess Bride"" line, ""mostly dead.""
I'm mostly over it. But not completely.
And you have moments where you, you know, go back and feel the sorrow of the loss. And so, yes, I think we're not mostly dead yet.

She may be mostly dead, but she's nowhere near done whining about it:
ANN ROMNEY: You never like it. And I never like it. And I -- you know, I'm like a she-lion when it comes to defending Mitt. And I know -- I know his heart; I know his abilities. I know he would have been a fabulous president and I mourn the fact that he's not there.
And it would have been -- it would have been much better for America, I believe, in my heart if he had been there right now.

 
Damn you, America! But at least she's not bitter. Not like, say, her husband:
MITT ROMNEY: The president had the power of incumbency. ObamaCare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote. So that was part of a successful campaign.
Curse that sneaky president and his popular policies that made people want to vote for him instead of the guy who called them a bunch of deadbeat takers! Oh, plus, also having a better campaign that everyone except the Romneys could see:
I think they had a better ground game. And I think we were not aware -- you know, we certainly had the passion coming from our side, and I don't think we were as aware of the passion that was coming from the other side. I think we were a little blindsided by that.
Yeah, it sure it surprising when all the polls turn out to be right and Karl Rove is wrong.
Also, Ann thinks the media and the Obama campaign were very unfair to her husband because he's a swell guy—no, really, he is!—and yet, for some reason, no one saw that.
WALLACE: Do you think the media was in the tank for Barack Obama?
(LAUGHTER)
ANN ROMNEY: I think that it's -- anytime you're running for office, you always think that you're being portrayed unfairly.
And, you know, we -- of course, on our side believe that there's more bias in favor of the other side. I think that that's a pretty universal -- universally-felt opinion.
WALLACE: What do you think of the campaign that Barack Obama ran?
ANN ROMNEY: I think, obviously, it was a winning campaign. It worked.
WALLACE: Do you think it was fair?
ANN ROMNEY: No.
WALLACE: In what way?
ANN ROMNEY: Portrayal of my husband. He is an exceptional, wonderful person.
(LAUGHTER)
MITT ROMNEY: She's not biased at all.
ANN ROMNEY: I'm not biased! And, you know, and he -- I mean, he really is a selfless person that really, truly cared about the American people. He truly cares about making a difference and about helping others. And for him to be portrayed in a very negative light in another way was very hard.
He has enormous skill set in dealing with difficult issues and I totally believe at this moment if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now.

If Mitt were president, there would be no sequester. Also, no war, no debt, no terrorism, no child would go to bed hungry at night, it would never rain on your wedding day, and everyone would have a pony. Two ponies! Because Mitt's that good. See what you're missing, America? DO YOU GET IT NOW?!?!?
Because Ann can't stop talking, Wallace then speaks with Mitt separately. He explains how Obama sucks because if Mitt were president, we wouldn't have the sequester, and also, Mitt totally worked with Democrats that one time he was governor, so, ya know. He woulda fixed all those problems by now. And as for all those awful things Mitt couldn't stop saying during the election? He didn't mean them anyway:
Yes, it was a very unfortunate statement that I made. It's not what I meant. I didn't express myself as I wished I would have.
Yup. That's the Mitt we all knew and despised—the guy who would say anything and then insist it's not what he meant anyway. Really a shame he's not our president now, isn't it?

What Benghazi is all about.



What Benghazi is all about.

DougJ:
Every scandal the right manufactures has something simple at its core: a stained blue dress, a long-form birth certificate, a Budhist temple. What is with Benghazi? I haven’t figure it out yet.
The glib (and accurate) answer is ""Hillary Clinton 2016"". You don't have to be a rocket scientist (or super-genius Jason Richwine) to crack that code. But even pretend scandals have some sort of narrative to tie them together. You know, the Clintons killed Vince Foster, Obama's birth certificate is forged, yadda yadda yadda.
But with this Benghazi thing ...
Best I can gather, it goes something like this: ""Obama knew the attacks were carried out by terrorists even as he was saying they were a result of a YouTube anti-Islamic movie.""
To that, the crazies respond with shit like this:
SUSAN RICE LIED
HILLARY LIED
OBAMA LIED
AMERICANS DIED

There is, of course, hilarious irony to this, given that this is the same crowd that didn't give a fuck about Bush's genuine lies that got people genuinely killed. And lots of them. But even assuming their version of ""reality"" has any semblance of truth, it doesn't follow that any administration lies would've cost any lives. At worst, using their own facts, the administration misled the public for a week following the attacks. At worst. Only with wingnut logic does a post-event misstatement create a time vortex in which people lose their lives in the past.
But in reality, Obama called the attacks a terrorist attack the day after the attacks. Remember, it was this alternate wingnut version of reality that got Mitt Romney in trouble with the iconic ""please proceed, governor"" moment during the second presidential debate.
Yet the alternate wingnut reality persists. Maybe that's inevitable. After over four years of the most scandal-free administration since forever, conservatives have to hang on to some semblance of malfeasance to continue justifying their pathetic hysteria, and given the failure of their Fast and Furious hysteria, maybe this Benghazi thing can become the new scandal of the century. If they keep screaming about it enough, perhaps people will suddenly start believing in time vortexes as well.

The answer, apparently, is more town halls.



The answer, apparently, is more town halls.

Michele Bachmann has gone from presidential ""contender"" (yeah, we're just gonna put some quotes around that one) to being in serious jeopardy of losing even her current House seat. That's not entirely surprising, of course: Even though she's in a deep-red district, she's been nearly booted a few times, and her recent race against Democrat Jim Graves turned out to be a squeaker. Then there's her presidential campaign being investigated by the FEC and FBI. Oh, and the bit where she keeps saying crackpot things and being a general embarrassment to her own party.
What's a bit different is that Bachmann seems to be keenly aware of how much difficulty she's already in. Which means her constituents are going to start seeing her a lot more often:
Bachmann declined to be interviewed for this story. Kotman, her spokesman, said: “It’s 18 months out, and she isn’t focused on the campaign. She’s focused on the district.” […]
Bachmann recently began running TV commercials highlighting her role in sponsoring legislation to repeal Obama’s health care bill — an unusually early time in the election season to start airing ads. And Republicans say they’re assured by the congresswoman’s busy in-district schedule — as of late, she seems more focused on holding town halls than on making headlines.
“She is working harder in the district than she has in the past,” said Ron Carey, a former Bachmann chief of staff. “It’s going to be harder to make the case that she’s an AWOL congresswoman.”

There's nothing that shows you're ""focused on your district"" more than cutting television ads highlighting yourself and your quixotic obsession with holding dozens and dozens of meaningless votes to repeal ObamaCare. She's a true saint, that one. (Oh, and her office has also already produced an anti-Graves, anti-Nancy Pelosi web video. Again, though, not focused on campaigning. Shame on you for thinking so.) Still, having your constituents hear more from you is a bit of a risky move, for far-right Republicans like Bachmann; the entire 2012 election season was ample enough evidence of that.
Having her constituents actually boot her should still be considered an uphill climb. It's at least a bit interesting, though, that her office seems already to be in a bit of panic.

Today's source material, thanks to the president's excellent trolling:

With the government shutdown over, President Obama took the opportunity to lecture his political opposition about the way government is supposed to work: he’s supposed to dictate, and others are supposed to remain silent.
President Barack Obama said no such thing, of course. What he actually said:
“I recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided. That's putting it mildly. That's OK. That's democracy. That's how it works. We can debate those differences vigorously, passionately, in good faith, through the normal democratic process. And sometimes we'll be just too far apart to forge an agreement.”
“You don't like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election. Push to change it. But don't break it. Don't break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building. That's not being faithful to what this country's about.”

Weird. ""Argue your position"" sounds nothing like ""remain silent""...
His core message was ""don't break democracy"" just because things didn't go your way. Sensible enough, right? But that dig about ""win an election""? It's sublime. It's taunting Republicans with something they are more and more incapable of doing by the passing day. So rather than say, ""Fine, we WILL win the next elections!"", they ... well, you can see for yourself below the fold.


We did win you dumb ass Obama. We elected people in the house to stop you. That's what elections are for and its not all about you and what you want.
This is kinda complicated, so I don't expect no teabagger to keep up: Democrats won the House popular vote by over 1 million. An artificial gerrymandered delivered a GOP majority. 50 teabaggers and their Senate papi effectively eliminated that GOP majority. So in the end, it was Democrats that made the House work.
From Reagan to Obama, in the past 8 Presidential Election cycles Republicans have won 5 times, and Democrats have won 3 times.
So, Mr. President. . . . .What's your point???

Popular vote winners:
Reagan
Reagan
Bush I
Clinton
Clinton
Gore
Bush II
Obama
Obama
That's nine presidential elections. Democrats won five of them. Better yet, Democrats have won five of the last six.
Still, I'm confused... Republicans get to throw tenter tantrums because Reagan was once president?
They did win elections! I know the DICTATOR doesnt respect the PEOPLES HOUSE but all of those republicans were elected and most of them campaigned on getting rid of his crappy healthcare law. He speaks of bipartisanship but his actions are totally the opposite. When Obama says WE WONT NEGOTIATE, how is that being bipartisan? He acts like a spoiled child. The reason he wont negotiate is because he simply doesnt know how to. He has never worked anywhere in the real world. He is a community organizer. He only knows how to rant and rave, picket and complain and beat his opponents into submission. Its like dealing with a child who just pisses and moans until the parent gives in. Unfortunately its been effective with this republican leadership that has little or no spine.The left's idea of compromise is that they get thier way no matter what. Compromise to them is simply to tell our side the we're really lucky that they didnt scew us even more. For example they say: We wanted a single payer system but we compromised with this free market solution by allowing private companies to be the insurance providers. We on the right hear them say: We could have went full blown communist on you but we compromised and only went socialist/facist on you.
Democrats NEVER compromise! Well, except that one time they compromised. And sure, it was a HUGE compromise because they did things the way WE wanted to, but, WHY WON'T THEY COMPROMISE?
1. We are not a democracy, we are a Constitutional Republic. 2. This is not a winner takes all political system. 3. You can only draw from a poisoned well so many times.
What about a well full of Tea Party Kool-Aid? When does that run out?
The most loyal voting bloc for the Dems. is the bloc of freeloading, panhandling, gimmee, gimmee, bums. It is tough to beat Santa Claus.
Why do people vote for people who are generous and kind and beloved and dedicated to bringing joy to the masses and kinda jolly? They should vote for Genghis Kahn instead.
If we ever have an honest election again, we need voter I.D., no illegal aliens, no dead voters, no one voting multiple times, no disallowing of the military vote, no district with over 100% voter turnout, you would not be so quick to say that
It was hard to cover up evidence of five million undocumented immigrants and dead voters voting!
STFU. I am your lord and god and thou shalt not oppose me. I'm growing tired of this whining little boy who really believes no one should criticize him. Grow up Little Man. We had thousands of Americans who died to free us from despots and I'll continue to speak out as long I have breath in my lungs.

We did...they're called Tea Party Republicans in the House of Representatives. And there will be more after the 2014 mid-terms.
They won FIFTY elections in the House. Why won't Obama let them decide them everything?
IMPEACH OBAMA NOW! This illegal alien has committed at least 50 impeachable acts against the Constitution. He is a walking Hitler incarnate who will murder millions of Americans with his ""change"".
FIFTY? Adorable! Every teabagger member in the House chipped in with a fantasy impeachable act.
Our national elections are as rigged as anything in Stalin's USSR! The illegal alien Obama was never elected...he was SElected, twice; and his agenda is the total destruction of the USA and the murder of tens of millions. This will allow the confiscation of all our wealth by the Jewish international banking cartel so they can invest in that slave labor nation, China. George Soros and his band of Hebrew gangsters are pulling all of Obama's strings. They are merely the latest in the continuing sacking of the wealthiest nations on earth and the murder of millions. HITLER was financed and set up by Jewish banksters on Wall Street; and so is Obama!
It was right there on his ""issues"" page: the murder of tens of millions, and he was still selected president by the sheeple!
Obama: 'Go Out There and Win an Election' if You Want to Oppose My Agenda
Well...those WI Democrat Senators didn't seem to get that message, Mr. President.

You mean the ones that tried to effect change with ... elections?
From the communist sneaker who stole into the first term by hiding his past, and stole into the second using the IRS to suppress his opponents. And now he wants an election crony in the military in charge of DHS. Posse comitatus, destroyed from the top. Time for the jackboots.
Go to H377 you evil communist, Frank Marshall POTUS. Go to H377.

Go to hett?
If Oblamo throws the gauntlet down, the least we can do is accept the challenge.
We can start by primary'ing McConnell. Heck, even Ed Schultz wants McConnell around. Was slobbering over all the pork projects McConnell votes for.

I don't think Obama was talking about pri-- Ah hell, that's exactly what he was talking about: beating Mitch McConnell. Lamar Alexander too. And Susan Collins. You know what? Just go whole hog and primary all of them.
Republican won 230 elections, ya dumba$$.
With fewer votes than the Democrats who won about 201. Because that's what happens in republics, apparently.
Hey, Mr. Community Organizer. Just because conservatives lost the election and you won doesn't mean that they will allow you to destroy this country. The inept and incompetent Obama as President is so far in over his head on doing the job someone needs to step in and do the job right or at least the way it should be done.
Why rehash the GOP's 2012 election message, given how poorly it performed?
How about we just drag this fraud out of office and dispatch him as a traitor?
Obama: Win an election
Teabagger: Sorry no-can-do. Maybe sedition instead?  
Those are the most evil eyes I have ever seen.

He gave himself away when he fought for expanded access to health care. Only Satan would want such evil.

The Nuremberg trials will get this traitor sooner or later.
False flags will commence now , probably another this week for punishment .
He is evil.
It'll be pretty awesome when he's shipped back in time to 1946 to stand trial.
Yeah, sure, go try to win an election now that the dims have hacked the electronic voting system and have a completely untraceable way to modify the election results in any county they so desire. Just a few close counties flipped is all it will take. So, go ahead, try to win against that.
Democrats are so incompetent that they have a system to rig elections in completely untraceable ways ... AND FORGOT TO USE IT IN THE HOUSE!

Actress Ashley Judd, who’s mulling a 2014 bid for the U.S. Senate against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, largely miffed an opportunity to prove herself on the national political stage Friday.
Judd gave a speech on public health, followed by an audience question and answer session, at George Washington University’s School of Public Health and Health Services in the Foggy Bottom area of Washington, D.C. The event was Judd’s first real political trial balloon ahead of a rumored 2014 Democratic U.S. Senate bid in Kentucky – and she flopped.
During her speech, Judd described her initial decision to enter the Hollywood acting world over the activism world.
“I went to the other jungle: Hollywood,” Judd said to the audience of about 150 students. “There, I had instantaneous success much to my own – what would the word be? – I wouldn’t even say surprise because I didn’t even know it was success until I looked back on it last year. It just all happened so very fast.”
“I remember when I was going [to Hollywood], I was talking to a family friend, and I was still frightened,” Judd continued. “Amazingly, I was raised with someone who has the greatest voice of her generation in our own home yet I didn’t have a lot of stage education. I didn’t know what it meant to be an actor.  So, I was scared. I was nervous. I was talking to this family friend and said, ‘you know, I’m still going to do a lot of service, I’m still going to help advocate that women need access to medically accurate sex education and have access to a full basket of family planning choices that are right for them.’ I went on to list the other things I was going to do and he said, ‘do you want to be an actor or do you want to save the world?'”
“In 2002, I was really sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Judd added. “I didn’t know what was wrong. I knew that I was just – something wasn’t quite right. At that time, it turns out, and I didn’t even know this, I was one of the highest paid women in the history of Hollywood.”
After admitting she is a card carrying member of the “One Percent,” the Americans Democrats routinely demonize, Judd went on to flub comment after comment throughout the rest of the event. 
When she was describing how she “got sick and tired of my own pity for myself,” Judd struggled to pronounce the word “periphery” correctly. 
Judd then name-dropped Bono.
“That very same day I got a call from Bono,” Judd said of the day an AIDS group asked her to help push their message. “No talk is ever complete without talking about Bono.”
“He’s amazing,” Judd said of Bono. “He’s the real deal.”
The actress went to explain how she determined “why women and girls end up in brothels,” telling the student audience that “baseline” it was “gender inequality.”
When Judd opened the floor up for questions, her struggles intensified. When asked by the dean of the college if she had advice for the community, Judd let the place know how wonderfully she thought of herself. “You know have no idea how much advice I have,” she said.
“I can’t wait to hear from the College Republicans,” Judd joked at another point, before any students asked her a question.
The first student questioner, a young woman who made sure to point out she was a Democrat, asked Judd to define “feminism.” Judd tackled it the best she could, after noting how “it’s really very simple.”
“We could spend the rest of the day talking about this,” Judd said. “We were all made in the image and likeness of our Creator. We’re all sacred, and we’re here to love each other and be equal. It’s very simple.”
As a second young woman wrapped up her question of Judd, the actress stopped paying attention. “Huh, I’m sorry, I was giving my mother eye kisses,” Judd said. Judd’s mother, Naomi Judd, was in the audience.
The dean was forced to re-ask the young woman’s question so Judd could answer it.
When asked about what role “faith” plays in her initiatives, Judd said “I’m just a surrogate for the people doing the grassroots work.”
“What I had to do was find a faith that would work for me under all causes and conditions,” Judd said. “In forcibly displaced persons camps, in child abuse children, in emergency rooms, in a brothel, in a labor slave camp, in an orphanage. You know how hard it is to walk out of an orphanage? My hands tingle. You feel the weight of the babies coming up behind.”
“Or to sit in a slum and see two sisters who are orphaned ask me to bring them home to America, because America is the place where dreams come true? Later I found out they rehearsed it because they so wanted to come home to America with me. That’s a depth for me, a spiritual depth.”
Another student asked her about garbage initiatives around the world. The student said she worked in India for a little while recently, and “the amount of garbage … I just could not get over it.”
“My question is how to we get anyone to care about their health when the first thing they probably need to care about is the dump of trash in front of their house or their slum, and that they don’t have running water?” the student asked Judd. “To me, that seems like the base…. I’m just wondering from what you’ve seen in your travels what your thoughts are on that.”
Judd used a homespun saying in her tortured response.
“My thought is that you found your pig,” Judd responded. “You should stick with your pig. What I mean by ‘pig’ is we all have to find the thing that makes us mad and the thing that gives us the fire in the belly and the passion and the stamina to stick with it. The ‘pig thing’ comes another good Eastern Kentuckian, my godmother. It was heavy-handed in my face.”
In trying to further explain the “pig” reference, Judd said “it became a slogan for this is ‘my thing.'” 
“It sounds like garbage has become your thing,” Judd told the student questioner. “Go with it. And I agree with you about the garbage.'”"

Remember this shocking, game-changing revelation? Neither did voters on Nov. 6.



Remember this shocking, game-changing revelation? Neither did voters on Nov. 6.

The election left a little tarnish on the crown of the Clown Prince of Conservative Entertainment Complex™. New York Daily News:
According to Nielsen numbers, Hannity lost around half of his audience in the weeks after the election, while his Fox News colleague Bill O’Reilly — who steadfastly refuses to identify himself politically as a conservative — retained around 70% of his audience.
So what happened to Hannity?
The going wisdom is that viewers who basked in his preelection anti-Obama rhetoric tuned him out when they were stunned to wake up on Nov. 7 and discover that the President had won a second term — a scenario that Hannity had all but promised could never happen.

The NYDN quotes Conor Friedersdorf from The Atlantic for some perspective:
“The right-leaning outlets like Fox News and Rush Limbaugh’s show are far more intellectually closed than CNN or public radio. If you’re a rank-and-file conservative, you’re probably ready to acknowledge that ideologically friendly media didn’t accurately inform you about Election 2012. Some pundits engaged in wishful thinking; others feigned confidence in hopes that it would be a self-fulfilling prophecy; still others decided it was smart to keep telling right-leaning audiences what they wanted to hear.”
For what it's worth, the more left leaning and centrist pundits, Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and Anderson Cooper on CNN, have seen little audience erosion. Maddow lost little and Anderson virtually none.
I'd certainly like to think that it reflects a permanent dispiriting that would signal a major realigning of the goals and tactics of the Conservative Entertainment Complex™. I'd like to think they'll wake up and recognize that constantly catering to the basest instincts of the Republican Party—however divorced from reality they might be—is not ultimately a good strategy. I'd like to dream of a world where the unmitigated bullshit the Conservative Entertainment Complex™ spews becomes their own undoing when the populous decides to seek out better sources of information.
But Conservative Entertainment Complex™ appears to have learned nothing from the election results.
I really think it's a cyclical blip. The Conservative Entertainment Complex™ won't see the light that easily, and their viewers haven't realized Hannity is feeding them a pack of lies. They're basically just dispirited and depressed and want to avoid all the bad news. They want to avoid having their nose rubbed in their fail during this very sensitive time. And, of course, they're all at guns shows stocking up. They have bunkers to build, dammit.
The fact that the lefter-leaning media is untouched indicates people who are able to cope with information from the reality-based universe are still interested and engaged in politics, and those who can't are just hiding out.
But the need Fox News' crowd feels to escape from reality and make their own alternative universe will not go away overnight.
And, by the time midterms roll around, Hannity will continue to feed his viewers lies and distortions and ridiculous hyperbolic nonsense. And his audience will sense—in their gut—that ""this time will be different!"" And they will follow him right over the Conservative Entertainment Complex™ cliff once again. Whatever charlatan Hannity and company will anoint as the savior of the conservative movement, they'll rally around them. There will be 2014 version of Romney, Mourdock, Cain, Akin, O'Donnell, Angle and Palin ... (or maybe those actual people, past failure is never a disqualifier).
Whoever it is, they will have finally found their ""true conservative"" and this time, the perfect conduit for the message! They'll find a silver bullet, be it Benghazi or the birth certificate or some new fabricated poutrage, and that one will really make the voters finally see the ""truth.""
And so it will continue.

Which is not to say we shouldn't savor this sweet moment of schadenfreude. Happy New Year! Please enjoy.

Do you want to help the Republican Party figure out what went wrong, in 2012? Of course you do. Towards that end, the Republican party has launched the Growth & Opportunity Project, chaired by such luminaries as Henry Barbour and Ari Fleischer, to recommend how best to not screw things up quite so horribly next time. And to help with that, they're using that most scientific of all tools, an internet survey.
The questions are, sadly, rather generic:
Which issues do you think Republicans should spend MORE time talking about? (please select one)
    - Fiscal issues, like taxes, government spending, and the debt
    - Economic issues, like unemployment, housing, and high energy prices
    - National Security issues, like terrorism, foreign policy, and national defense
    - Social issues, like abortion and family values
They also ask you to rate how much ""improvement"" the party needs in areas like ""Diversity within the Party"" and ""How the Party communicates with voters.""
Republicans looking to interject their opinions will probably be disappointed, however. In a dozen or so pages of questions to fill out, only four or so invite you to give your input on the actual Republican Party and their efforts. All the others are demographic questions—data mining stuff. What's your name? What age are you? What's your email address, little feller? You know, the kind of questions you teach your kids not to answer during their own internet sessions.
Hey, at least the party leaders are asking for opinions, right? Your opinion is only worth about 1/4th of the content on an actual opinion survey, but it's a start? Surely it's not just a flimsy effort towards party list-building under the guise of momentary introspection.

An overlooked factor in the Democrats winning control of the House of Representatives in 2006 was the recruitment of middle-of-the-road, culturally conservative candidates. At the time then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel, who headed the effort, infuriated many on the left by aggressively recruiting dozens of “blue dog democrats” to challenge GOP incumbents. The effort worked, but the Democrats soon forgot the lesson. 
After Obama’s election, Democrat leaders believed they had a mandate for progressive policies. In the first two years of his term, Congress tacked far to the left, tackling cap-and-trade and ObamaCare. Corporate bailouts and billions in stimulus repelled independents. In 2010, House Democrats suffered the biggest electoral loss in history. Blue Dog Democrats, who had made up almost 25% of the Democrat caucus, were decimated. 
Obama’s reelection has apparently again convinced national Democrats they have a mandate for their progressive ideas. Obama has all but ruled out serious spending cuts and is aggressively pushing for even more tax increases. Democrats across the country are pursuing gun control legislation with a zeal that hasn’t been seen in decades. 
They are also vowing action on climate change, amnesty and a hike in the minimum wage. They are moving much further down the left-policy road than the rest of the country. 
When Democrats lost the House in 2010, they also lost hundreds of seats in state Legislatures, giving Republicans a strong hand in redistricting. As a result, to win back the House, Democrats need to win more than a dozen seats that were won by Mitt Romney last year. 
Obama’s hard tack to the left may be good for his base voters. The political fortunes’ of House Democrats are not built on his base voters, though. They need to appeal to independent, moderate voters who live in areas that lean GOP. They are building the wrong agenda for that task.

Starting yesterday, the talented Rachel Maddow will be authoring monthly columns for the Washington Post. In her first, she highlights a little-remarked upon aspect of the 2012 Presidential campaign--that George W. Bush, ""history's actor,"" the last Republican to hold the White House, presiding over our country for eight seemingly endless years--was nowhere to be seen.
It's an appropriate introduction for Dr. Maddow. The shadow of Bush looms not only over today's Republican Party, but on all of us, and especially on Maddow herself. In a real sense she owes her career--and Markos owes the success of this site--to the depravity of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney.
Bush made no noteworthy appearances for any candidate in 2012. He was a non-entity at the Republican National Convention. Not even the corporate media that had fawned over his worst excesses seemed interested in what he thought--about anything. His was the ""name that shall not be named,"" terminating the lofty aspirations of his heir apparent brother and bringing the family dynasty to a screeching halt. For a two-term President to have been utterly shunted by his own Party to the silent dustbin of history is a singular accomplishment. Maddow points out that no former Bush official holds any major visible position in today's Republican hierarchy:
[B]y the time the Bush era was winding down, the whole administration, including the president, was stewed in terrible, Cheney-level disapproval ratings. And now, almost no one who played a significant role in that administration is anywhere to be found in electoral politics, beyond the tertiary orbits of Punch-and-Judy cable news and the remains of what used to be the conservative “think tank” circuit.
2012 simply cemented the consensus felt by the GOP in 2008, that the Bush name carried the toxicity and accompanying shelf-life of a nuclear meltdown:
The 2008 Republican presidential primaries were like some odd eight-year cicada hatch in which the candidates went underground in 2000 and then birthed themselves after Bush and Cheney were gone, as if the intervening years had never happened.
The Bush legacy is so tainted that it has spawned an ideological shift in a GOP that, however dimly, recognizes that the face in the rear-view mirror is too hideous for most Americans to bear.  Hence the outsized rise of the Libertarian elements in the party (perceived by Maddow as having at least the potential to win over a more youthful demographic).  But even of those, the search for viable new leaders is crippled by the wreckage left in Bush's wake.  The damage done by Bush to his own party is historic in and of itself.
She believes that the Bush experience contains a cautionary note for the Democrats as well. While President Obama's tenure is hardly likely to leave the negative blowback on the Democratic Party that Bush foisted on the GOP, the President's legacy to his Party is something he should be aware of and working on at this point in his second term.  The rise of a more progressive breed of Democrats, particularly in the Senate, ought to inspire that effort going forward.   And although hailed by the corporate soothsayers as the inevitable nominee in 2016, Hillary Clinton thus far (in Maddow's eyes) simply hasn't generated the grassroots enthusiasm one would expect from the Democratic base:
Unless Vice President Biden’s presidential hinting suddenly takes a turn for the serious, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is the obvious inheritor of the party’s mantle. But, as in 2008, the Beltway may be overstating her inevitability. The grass roots aren’t all with her, frankly, and it’s yet to be seen if she’s interested in trying to win them over. Mainstream press may buy big-dollar donors (and more mainstream press), but it can’t buy the passionate volunteers and activists and excitement that are the oxygen for a winning campaign and sustained, effective leadership.
The bottom line? The President should be concerned about the legacy he leaves when he departs the Oval Office. And if Hillary is to inherit that legacy, she will first and foremost need to answer to us.

Radio host and perennial ""prominent Republican"" Mike Huckabee is rapidly becoming what Rush Limbaugh used to be 20 years ago. (What Rush is now we'll leave as the topic for another time.) Here Huckabee is embracing the far-right militia logic of violence and conspiracy theories with open arms, and then some:
CALLER: I’m very concerned, it seems like there’s so many people who have not read and do not understand how quickly Germany was turned into, it was a democracy, then turned into a dictatorship by  everyone having to register their guns and then they went door to door and collected them.
HUCKABEE: People do forget that. And by the way, [caller] know, that when you bring that up you get people who get crazy on us, and they’ll start saying, “Oh there you go comparing to the Nazis.” And I understand the reaction, but it’s the truth. You cannot take people’s rights away if they’re resisting and if they have the means to resist, but once they’re disarmed and the people who are trying to take over have all the power, not just political, not just financial, but they have the physical power to domesticate us and to subjugate us to our will there’s not a whole lot we can do about it other than just plan to die in the course of resistance. […] In every society and culture where dictators take over, one of the things they have to do is get control of the military and the police and ultimately all of the citizens and make sure the citizens are disarmed and can’t fight in the streets. Gosh I hope it doesn’t come to that.

Getting the first thing out of the way, no, it's not true; the Nazi regime weakened gun regulations, it didn't strengthen them. That's a lost cause, however, as it's one of the conservative ""facts"" that will stick around until long after the fall of civilization itself, and even after that, as future alien archeologists will be finding primitive cave paintings of Hitler taking people's guns away and displaying them in their alien museums as the one of the few remaining artifacts of western culture. So we're just going to ignore that part.
What's more interesting to me is that Mike Huckabee, the once supposedly reasonable Republican, continues to peddle crackpot, militia-level conspiracy theories to his audience with no apparent shame—but gosh, I hope it doesn't come to that, he says. The core notion is that we need lots and lots of guns in case patriots need to start murdering the government, so it goes without saying that fighting off even the most basic of gun safety efforts is a noble, patriotic clause. The current rate of mass murders and other random killings aren't the symptom of a problem, in this mindset, they're just the necessary validation that the citizenry does indeed have enough access to high-powered weaponry to murder a very large number of people quickly if any single one of them feels like it. Forget talk of well-regulated; any talk of regulating the ability of any one random person to commit such acts is tantamount to nascent dictatorship.
These people, the ostentatiously Christian Mike Huckabee included, look to the prospect of potential mass murder against the government as a perfectly valid political position to have. They look to such acts as potential patriotism; others would call the same thing terrorism, but all terrorists consider themselves patriots for one cause or another. The rather unusual thing about this particular crowd is how circular the logic is. They need to be able to murder the government if the government appears to be taking actions that limit their ability to murder that government, and that's usually the extent of the argument. Not as a group, mind you, but as individual citizens, each making the decision as to what would require government assassinations on their own, based on their own internal logic, armed with enough firepower by themselves to inflict enough necessary ""damage"" to make their point.
That's now the advocated-for position among everything from conservative radio hosts to the National Rifle Association to any number of obviously unhinged, heavily armed YouTube video hosts. How is that not nuts?

Nick Gillespie defends libertarians as something more (or less) than caricature.
The specter of libertarianism is haunting America. Advocates of sharply reducing the government’s size, scope and spending are raising big bucks from GOP donors, trying to steal the mantle of populism, being blamed for the demise of Detroit and even getting caught in the middle of a battle for the Republican Party. Yet libertarians are among the most misunderstood forces in today’s politics. Let’s clear up some of the biggest misconceptions.
Still, hard to take any column (or movement) seriously that pretends Ayn Rand was an intellectual.
Dana Milbank:
Republicans need to make up their minds: Is President Obama a socialist or a corporate stooge?
“The president claims his economic agenda is for the middle class. But it’s actually for the well-connected,” Paul Ryan, the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, wrote this week in USA Today, rejecting Obama’s latest proposal for a corporate tax cut. “There’s no doubt that it works well for them. But for the rest of us, it’s not working at all.”...
Republican lawmakers seem to think that Americans have short memories and lack Internet connections, for their latest line of attack — that Obama’s health-care and tax policies favor the corporate elite — directly contradicts their previous allegation that Obama was waging “class warfare” with “socialist” policies attacking these very same corporate elites.

Making Obama out as the defender of the elite is the populism side of libertarian populism. Yeah, its as awkward as it reads here, but the GOP literally has nothing else.
Matthew Yglasias:
I've been meaning to write a deadly dull low-traffic blog post on the subject of ""libertarian populism"" for a while now, and I think my bottom line is this—economic populism can (and probably should) become more libertarian, but libertarianism can never be populist.
I'll have my own deadly dull low-traffic blog post on the subject tomorrow, Matt, so you don't have to and much more today after the fold.



Village Voice:
Rightbloggers Look to ""Libertarian Populism"" (Minus the Neo-Confederates) as Key to Future Success
Paul Waldman:
In case you missed it, the new Republican watchword is ""Libertarian populism,"" which is quickly being embraced by people who are neither libertarians nor populists. But it's a shorthand for an impossibly inane attack that Republicans are trying out, seeing if they can make any hay by charging that President Obama is only interested in helping rich people at the expense the rest of us. Okay, the rest of you, I guess, because these are Republicans we're talking about, and they're not part of that ""us,"" but you get the idea. All of sudden, people like Paul Ryan are out there saying, ""The president claims his economic agenda is for the middle class. But it's actually for the well-connected. There's no doubt that it works well for them. But for the rest of us, it's not working at all.""
Jonathan Chait:
The “libertarian populism” debate has already gotten interminable. On the other hand, Republicans have already pivoted to making a version of this their official message, having transitioned from bashing President Obama as the socialistic enemy of Job Creators to bashing him as a corrupt crony-capitalist handmaiden of wealth. The ease of this transition reveals the inherent flabbiness of the concept and its very limited use as a governing principle.
Kathleen Parker has an incomprehensible column today citing the idiocy of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and concluding it's all because Obama refuses to compromise and McCain got old or something.
As everyone knows, Republicans are to blame. They are the obstructionists, the just-say-no enemies of women, immigrants, health care for the poor, shoes for the born and equality for gay whales, to mention a few.
This “narrative,” as they say, is pure propaganda. President Obama achieved huge legislative victories (Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, bailouts, two Supreme Court appointments) when he had hefty majorities in Congress. Once those margins were lost or reduced in the 2010 election, the president’s focus shifted to scoring political points by shouting, “Obstruction!” In truth, no serious efforts have been made toward compromise because it is in neither side’s political interest...
Today, as time would have it, McCain is Mr. Establishment. He not only lunches with the enemy but dines with the president. Isn’t this how life goes? Teenagers eventually grow up and become their parents. McCain is the GOP grandpa swatting at ankle-biting upstarts such as fellow Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

Read it for yourself and see if you can figure it out. I give up.
Thank God for Gail Collins:
In normal times, back when Congress got things done and disco was extremely popular, the transportation bill was easy to pass. Everybody likes roads and bridges. This year, THUD was a labor of love in the Senate Appropriations Committee, where Barbara Mikulski is chairwoman, Patty Murray is the leader of the transportation subcommittee and Susan Collins is the top-ranking Republican. I am not going to point out that they are all women. Just that they worked well together and were considerate of everyone’s feelings.
After long and effortful negotiations, they came up with a bipartisan deal that made most people reasonably happy. In another show of good will, Murray — who handled the bill on the floor — agreed to let the senators keep debating until their tongues fell out and permitted the introduction of more than 80 proposed amendments. “Including,” she said in a phone interview, “one totally off-message and off-subject on Egypt.”
Ah, yes. That would have been the work of Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the libertarian White House wannabe. Paul proposed withdrawing foreign aid to Egypt and using it for bridge repair. The Middle East is not something you’re supposed to fiddle around with during a transportation debate, but, as Murray said, she was going the extra mile. The amendment was defeated 86 to 13.

Daily News:
ARLINGTON, Va. — This state is good at peddling guns. Now it’s peddling lies about New York.
A war between the states erupted Friday, after Mayor Bloomberg blasted Virginia for its weak gun laws.
Bloomberg railed that 90% of all guns used in city crimes in 2011 came from other states — and that more of them came from Virginia than anywhere else, including the weapon that killed NYPD officer Peter Figoski in December of that year.
“We’re getting killed, and we’re getting killed with guns ... from elsewhere,” Bloomberg charged...
We wish the mayor well as he attempts to address these issues within his home state and we hope he won’t hesitate to call on us if our law enforcement agencies can be of assistance in ensuring public safety in New York City,” she sniffed.
But the Daily News checked the numbers — and McDonnell isn’t facing facts.
New York State, with 3.5 murders per 100,000 people, had a lower murder rate than Virginia, which had 3.9 killings for every 100,000 people.

Kaboom.



Kaboom.

Just four months ago, I wrote:
True, today's deal preserved the existing filibuster rule, but it really didn't. Democrats established that they could bust through any filibuster with a simple majority anytime they wanted. Sure, it's still a process to do so, full of blustery threats and hyperbolic doomsaying, but it's a process [...]
But if Republicans continue to prevent up-or-down votes on further administration officials, or perhaps more importantly, judicial ones, Democrats now have a tool to force action. And that means we've come a long way from a few years ago, when Senate Democrats simply shrugged at the inevitability of the GOP filibuster arguing they had no other option.

I must admit, I didn't expect Republicans to challenge this notion this quickly. And the reason is simple: Even with a truncated and compromised filibuster, Republicans were able to gum up the works to unprecedented levels. As Bill Sher at the Campaign for America's Future notes, the federal judiciary is now evenly balanced, with 390 GOP-appointed judges and 391 Democratic-appointed ones. However, there are 93 vacancies.
Republicans could relent on Obama’s right to fill vacancies and keep the filibuster in place. Obama would get some more judges, but he would not be able to fill all the outstanding vacancies by next year considering that he has only identified nominees for about half of those seats. But if Republicans provoke the end of the filibuster, then I suspect the White House can quickly find another 50 or so judges without much fuss.
In other words, surrendering on three judges would've allowed the GOP to continue obstructing the other 87. Provoking the Democrats into eliminating the filibuster, on the other hand, now allows Democrats to ram all 90 through with minimal trouble. And there's no longer any need to try and find judges that can pick up a handful of Republican votes, so they should prove better ideologically. This will also take the judiciary from a 50-50 partisan split to a 55-45 Democratic-appointed one. And we still have another three years of vacancies ahead of us before we choose our next president.
So why surrender their ability to gum up the works? Is it a bet that they'll take over the chamber in the 2014 elections? Not really. A presidential veto would negate the need for minority Democrats to filibuster.
So is it a bet that Republicans will take both the Senate next year, and the White House in 2016? Perhaps. But if so, why not give proper deference for three years, relent on a handful of judges, preserve the filibuster, and then ditch it when they theoretically took power in early 2017?
None of this makes sense. Republicans have been daring Democrats to go nuclear all week, and today things went ""boom!"". But that bomb detonated over Republicans while Democrats watched from a safe bunker miles away. So what were Republicans thinking?

This is classic mainstream media tactical deflection. In order to take the spotlight off Hillary not reading the cables (which is why Paul criticized her) from our Libyan consulate requesting more security, Moran wants to make Paul the issue. 
You see, Paul’s question and statement of fact doesn’t matter, because Paul’s resume is more important. 
This is how the media turns an inconvenient narrative away from its own (a Democrat) and then trains its fire on whomever dares to politically damage one of its own. Libya has been a non-stop exercise in this kind of media behavior. Four Americans die under Obama’s watch, Romney dares say something, and the media makes him the story for 10 days; not the terrorist attack, the lack of security, or the subsequent administration cover up. 
Remember all the hand-wringing we saw from the elite media when someone with no foreign policy experience ran for president in 2008?
Yeah, me neither. 
Man alive, what an era the Democrats live in! No accountability, the watchdogs always have your back; and like magic, lies are turned into truth.

It is worth noting that in most of the serious political crises during (or, more accurately, fomented by) the Obama administration, President Barack Obama has done nothing to reach agreements, and much to destroy them. Dealmaking comes down–alarmingly!–to Vice President Joe Biden’s intercessions.
Now there’s an additional reason to question President Obama’s leadership–and competence to hold office: he apparently thinks that he never tried to get media attention as a first-term U.S. Senator–not like that evil, self-interested Ted Cruz. He also, he says, never voted to shut down the government (never mind that vote against the debt ceiling, which even his spokespeople have admitted was a “political” gambit).
How utterly crazy is the president’s claim? He may have kept a low legislative profile in the Senate, where he barely showed up for work, but he was constantly the center of media attention–and made himself so. He led the left’s opposition to the Bush administration, for instance–and the centrist Clinton faction. He wrote The Audacity of Hope–a bestseller, and one that involved much media promotion, of course.
Then there was the whole running for president in his first term thing. Even before the campaign, Obama was making the media rounds, even appearing on a commercial during Monday Night Football in 2006 to tease the media’s appetite for his political ambitions. It doesn’t get much more self-promoting than this:


In fact, all Barack Obama was as a first-term U.S. Senator was a media sensation–the biggest ever. And it’s pretty much all he’s been since, judged by his lack of interest in doing his actual job. To insist otherwise, you’ve really got to be cracked. I never thought I’d say this, but maybe he should step down for Uncle Joe.

He says it wasn't technology's fault (apparently conservatives have been going around saying that Stevens screwed things up by not having mad Twitter skillz)—no, it was a generational thing.
I don’t think it’s very controversial to suggest that a candidate who favors gay marriage and free contraception might have more appeal to a younger demographic.
Mitt's problem, you see, was that the content of his message was completely unappealing to the young folks, what with their wanting ""Obamacare"" and gay marriage and maybe some jobs eventually please if that's not too much to ask. That's not something a Twitter account can fix. No, what will fix that is substance, and by substance we have no idea what we actually mean but it sounds pretty good so let's go with that. Let's take a look, below the fold:


Content is king. The ugly, clunky Drudge Report site still harvests record numbers of eyeballs because it serves up a hearty meal at a good price: free. The content rule is true across mediums. How many graphic makeovers and relaunches has CNN attempted to arrest its slow slide? The simple truth is that most people feel there is no reason to watch CNN, and they are happy not to. Meanwhile, “Storage Wars” racks up viewers and “Dog,” the bounty hunter, has a new series.
So whatever ""content"" is, it consists of publishing faked or misleading news stories peddled by GOP insiders and the cheap sensationalism of mid-tier reality shows, and that's still better than whatever CNN is dishing out on any given day. Noted.
So it is in politics. A Republican renaissance will inevitably be driven by policy.
Policy like ""Drudge"" and ""Storage Wars,"" or like Drudge? I have no idea where Stevens is going with this one. Neither does he, since he then goes on to praise Michael Gerson and Alex Castellanos for their contributions to noting the overpowering stench of decay coming from the party, which is a bit like praising your child for recognizing that maybe stapling their thumb to their forehead wasn't such a great idea after all. I mean it's fine, but the standards have gotten a little low.
Today, social media fulfill much of the need for community and togetherness that were once provided by bowling leagues, church suppers and, yes, political parties. Like interests are drawn together through the invisible connectivity of virtual communities.
Facebook is actually a hell of a lot like church suppers, at least as I remember them. The bitter recriminations, the snide comments that seem to be insults but you're never quite sure, the people who are way too proud of their current food product; ah, brings me back. All right, so we've learned that Republicans don't have a technology problem, and that technology is good, and that Republicans can win by adopting good, sensible policies like those featured on the Drudge Report and Honey Boo Boo. But what about the young people? How will Republicans compete with the likes of Obamacare and gay marriage for the hearts of the young people?
For 2016, the Democrats seem headed toward a fight between Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Both launched their careers in the 1970s; what will their slogan be, “Another Century of Service”?
On our side, we have Paul Ryan, Nikki Haley, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Susana Martinez and more. Who has the best opportunity to win that generational battle?

Ah. As the GOP plan for wooing Hispanic Americans consists of the phrase ""Hey look, here's Marco Rubio,"" the GOP plan for wooing young people will be to say, ""Hey, look! We've got Chris Christie and Jeb Bush! They're pretty young, right? I mean, they've at least still got their original hips.""
Well, you can't argue with that logic. Republicans are going to win the next generation by turning Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush into a boy band, which will then appeal to the young folks because content, where content means calling Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton old farts. This column really demonstrates how deep-thinking Republican strategy sessions must be. Really, I can't imagine why they lost.

Republicans gave us the Cheneys. Now they pay the price.



Republicans gave us the Cheneys. Now they pay the price.

This sort of stuff is what makes Liz Cheney's decision to move from Virginia to Wyoming in order to run for U.S. Senate against Mike Enzi so much fun:
Rep. Cynthia Lummis, a two-term Republican lawmaker, called Cheney “the shiny new pony” in Wyoming politics, but slammed Cheney for a lack of etiquette in making her intentions known to her opponent, Sen. Mike Enzi.
“I don’t think she’s going about it the right way,” Lummis, R-Wyo., told a scrum of reporters in the Speaker’s Lobby during votes on Tuesday night.  [...] “There’s a great history of intraparty decorum in Wyoming, especially when it comes to these higher-profile offices, and certainly that decorum has been broken here,” she added. “I think it’s problematic.  I think it’s bad form.”

Of course Lummis is also annoyed because until Cheney entered the scene, she was the heir apparent to Enzi. In fact, if Enzi does bow out (which is still possible), she'll run in his place.
Like Lummis, Enzi himself (not surprisingly) is also whining about Cheney's entrance:
“She said that if I ran she wasn’t going to run, but obviously that wasn’t correct,” Enzi said, speaking to reporters as he left the Senate floor. “I thought we were friends. [...] It’s kind of interesting that about 30 minutes after I put out a release saying that I intend to run, she put out one saying she was running,” Enzi told reporters. “She’s watching pretty closely what I’m doing. This is different than what she was saying before — that if I didn’t run, she would run.”
Enzi sounds like he's offended by Cheney's decision to run, but he shouldn't be taking this personally. There are two reasons why she's running, and neither of them have anything to do with him.
First, Liz Cheney thinks she's entitled to whatever she wants because she's Dick Cheney's daughter.
Second, Wyoming has about ten thousand times as many tumbleweeds as it does actual people, so Cheney doesn't think victory will be hard.
In Wyoming, winning the Republican primary is pretty much a guarantee that you'll win the general—and it doesn't take much to win the primary. In 2010, which was the highest turnout Republican primary in recent years, just 110,000 people turned out to vote. In other words, Cheney realizes that even if 2014 is also a high-turnout primary, she only needs to win about 55,000 votes to become a U.S. Senator.
So while Liz Cheney running isn't good news for Mike Enzi and isn't good news for Republicans who want to avoid intraparty fights, it wouldn't take much for her to win. And that's good news for Liz Cheney—and for those of us who are easily amused by the sight of Republicans eating their own.

Tuesday’s remarks by new Republican National Committee Chief of Staff Mike Shields seen as critical of conservative grassroots activists have not been well received by either the icons of the conservative movement or local grassroots leaders.
Despite efforts by RNC spokesperson Sean Spicer to walk those comments back, local conservative grassroots leaders–almost all of whom have been working hard for over four years with no compensation–remain unimpressed.
Ben Cunningham, founder of the Nashville Tea Party and one of the leaders of the decade earlier Tennessee Tax Revolt, told Breitbart News that “we are not about to be led by a bunch of timid Washington, D.C. Brahmins who are interested in making a buck off of people they see as naive. Either join us in the fight or get the hell out of the way.”
Cunningham added that “the problem for Washington, D.C.-based Republican consultants is they have become almost completely detached from the passion and purpose of the grassroots. To the grassroots Tea Party activist,” Cunningham continued,  “the future of the country is at stake and they immediately distrust ‘consultants’ who feel uneasy about manifesting their passion and fighting for the cause. Tea Party activists have been demonized and vilified and called every name in the book by liberals for four years and it has only made us stronger and more determined than ever.”
Zan Green, founder of the Rainy Day Patriots, a local tea party in Birmingham, Alabama organized in February 2009, echoed Cunningham’s sentiments. “The RNC is welcome to join ‘We The People’ in our self funded, personal-time-spent efforts to restore our republic. We could use some team players and there is always room for more boots on the ground.” 
Eric Olsen, co-founder of the 5,000 member Montana Shrugged Teaparty Patriots of Billings, Montana, told Breitbart News that “I take exception to all the reports coming from the Republican old guard.  They do not realize it, but they are losing their base with such remarks.”  
According to Olsen “the GOP should totally embrace the teaparty/grassroots followers as it is to their best interest.  But they lack the political will to do so.  Instead they demean the success of the movement.  They purposely went out of their way last election cycle to disenfranchise the tea party, libertarian and Ron Paul supporters.  We all know what happened then.  They lost crucial elections across the nation while successful teaparty backed candidates like Ted Cruz won handily.”
Olsen called the RNC Autopsy report “a joke,” and added that “it shows the willingness of the old guard GOP to throw their platform under the bus giving in to the pressure from the extreme left.”  
“Passion for America,” Olsen concluded,  “is the only force that will resurrect real hope and change for the United States.” "

Kilgore is so committed to the idea of having Texas leave the union that he legally changed his name – Larry SECEDE Kilgore. That’s the way he’ll appear on the ballot next March in the Texas Republican primary, where he is challenging front runner Greg Abbott for the GOP nomination.
Kilgore talking with the clerk when next renewing his driver's license: ""No, that's SECEDE with all caps. All the letters.""
Apparently Larry SECEDE's big contribution to Republicanism is that he wants gay Americans to vote for him too so that, at long last, Texas can SECEDE. Once that's out of the way, we'll worry about the pesky details of who in the new Texas utopia will be able to kill who, and why.
Kilgore believes the Bible offers a good guide for government. As such, he suggests that in accordance with the biblical injunction against homosexuality, gay people should be put to death. But Kilgore says he’s willing to temporarily set aside his opposition to homosexuals in the interest of winning. [...]
“I am a Christian, and I have lots of Christian beliefs. However, I am trying to build a coalition of all different types of people. I look at the lesbians and the homosexual folks and I say, ‘Hey, D.C. is stealing my money just like they’re stealing your money.’ After we get our freedom, then we can decide all that stuff — hopefully at a county level. Right now, lesbians and homosexuals and Christians may have differences with each other, but we’ve got a bigger enemy.”

So good news for all of you gay Texas Republicans—Larry SECEDE's willing put aside the question of whether or not we murder all the gay people until after y'all get your ""freedom."" Vote Larry!
There is going to be a debate, right? We will get to hear all the Texas Republican candidates for gubbiner debate their important issues like what the new free Texas flag will look like and who has the most awesomest middle name. Oh, but I suppose we can't have every nut in Texas up there on the same stage, so the party will probably limit it to ""serious"" candidates only, candidates who have a prayer of actually getting nominated.

Eventually, what you throw out into the world comes back to you.   I grew up with Bob Dole.   I had dinner with him once, he came to our house as a child, we visited him in his office in Washington DC.
Today, there would be issues I would have with Bob Dole on the policy front, but despite all of that, I never felt as a youth or now that Dole didn't ""say what he meant, mean what he said"" or that he wasn't willing to work with others.  
Today, the Boston Globe lays out exactly what is wrong with the Republican party from Dole's perspective.
http://www.boston.com/...
Dole was 89 years old, just out of the hospital, working the phones to win senators’ support. Then, in a dramatic effort, he rolled in his wheelchair onto the Senate floor, all but daring senators to vote against him and, by proxy, anyone with a disability.
It was a moment Dole had long awaited. He had brought the parties together to pass his greatest piece of legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which required the retrofitting of buildings and sidewalks and provided an array of other rights.
Now he wanted the Senate to approve an international treaty that would spur other nations to pass their version of the law, making the United States a role model to help tens of millions of people around the world.



It was an event in the late eighties, my brother had just won the state National Geographic bee.   Suffering from a broken arm and forced to lay on a mat on the stage, he pressed on to have one of those weekends we will all remember.
We received cards from several, but it was a phone call from our senator - Robert Dole - that came across to let us know that he was proud of the effort and wanted to talk.   The only issue on the list of those around us surrounded basic rights - especially for the disabled.   Senator Dole came to a town event early the next year, stopped in and laid out why working toward the Americans with Disabilities Act was important to him.  
Giving people a chance to participate in society was the way to move things forward; and that the most important role of government was to allow more people to participate in every level.
Now, twenty years later, former Senator Dole sees what his party has become and tells us something is very wrong.
As Dole sat in his Washington law office in February, still stunned by the outcome, he blamed his own party and suggested a headline: “Republican Party closes its doors to make repairs.” The GOP, added Dole, one of the party’s most revered figures, “needs a timeout” to tone down the antigovernment rhetoric.
The article is chock full of quotes that describe the problem with the current leadership of the republican party.
They saw their job as meeting halfway. “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something,” Dole said.
Supporters hoped the time was right to win ratification. Of the 193 countries in the United Nations, 155 have signed the treaty and 129 have ratified it, including countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, and Russia. In an effort to win Republican support, treaty backers asked Dole to take up the fight. The old warrior, while weakened from his most recent hospitalization, promptly agreed.
No one disputed the difficulties faced by many of the 1 billion people worldwide with disabilities; in many developing countries, most children with disabilities don’t go to school and have little chance of gainful employment, not to mention basic accommodation, according to the State Department. Ratifying the treaty, supporters said, would spread American leadership around the globe as well as create new markets for US-made disabilities products.

Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Jim DeMint of South Carolina, favorites of the Tea Party, wrote an op-ed for The Washington Times that said the treaty “calls for government agents to supersede the authority of parents of disabled children and even covers abortion.”
Dole and other supporters of the treaty viewed the charges as laughably false. The treaty legislation clearly stated that it required no change in US law, and there were no new abortion rights, they said.

Republicans turned their backs on those who were part of one of their greatest victories.  
I can remember sitting in a room listening to Senator Dole tell us how he always held a pen in his hand - a hand he couldn't really use due to a war injury, because as a younger man from the war the sign of disability made it harder for him to get respect; and holding a pen in his hand was a way to seem as though he was doing something and to hide a disability.   His story was a moving moment to how a person understood directly the issues that face those who are disabled.
I am not here to rah-rah a Republican Senator who I'm sure we all would have many policy disagreements with.   But I am here to remember a Republican Senator who pushed through the Americans with Disabilities Act.   He put forward the Clean Air Act.  
I read the article at the Boston Globe and remember that at one point, Dole was right "" “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something""
Too bad the current Republicans believe they are elected to make sure nothing happens.  A nation cannot move forward if leadership from 20 years ago looks infinitely more progressive then a current implementation of a party.  While everyone else tries to move forward, the modern Know-Nothings do everything in their power to take as many steps back as possible.

Short version: McCain says Hagel sucks because he was mean to Bush



Short version: McCain says Hagel sucks because he was mean to Bush

Yesterday, Senate Republicans blocked a vote on former Sen. Chuck Hagel's nomination to be secretary of defense, marking the first time in American history that any nominee for defense secretary has been filibustered. But don't worry, they had a very good reason to launch their historic act of destructive obstruction. Sen. John McCain, please take it away:
It goes back to there’s a lot of ill will towards Senator Hagel because when he was a Republican, he attacked President Bush mercilessly and said he was the worst President since Herbert Hoover and said the surge was the worst blunder since the Vietnam War, which was nonsense. He was anti-his own party and people — people don’t forget that.
In other words, this is about Republicans defending their honor by standing up for George W. Bush and the Iraq War. It would be unbelievable, except these are the same guys who brought you George W. Bush and the Iraq War. And now, unlike Hagel who at least recognized his bad judgment for supporting W. and Iraq, virtually all Republicans are still committed to defending their incredibly damaging record.
But, as we'll see below the fold, there appears to be another reason McCain blocked Hagel: he didn't like being cc'd on a letter. He denies this, but take a look at the facts and decide for yourself.


As BuzzFeed's Rebecca Berg explains, on Thursday morning McCain denied having received a letter he had requested from the White House about Benghazi:
""I have not received the letter,"" McCain told CNN Thursday morning. ""They sent the letter to Sen. Levin. It was Sen Graham and I and Ayotte that asked for an answer. We haven't received an answer.""
In the interview, he said the letter's delay was a chief reason he was holding up a vote on Hagel's nomination.
""I have to receive a letter, I have to receive a letter, see whether I receive a letter or not, and there are other questions that other senators have raised which are not answered as well,"" McCain told CNN.

So McCain said he was upset that Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) had received a letter with answers to his questions, but that he hadn't received it. Fair enough, except the thing is, McCain actually had received the letter—the very same letter that had been sent to Sen. Levin. The only catch: McCain had been cc'd.
The White House responded to McCain's concern by sending the exact same letter it had already sent to him, but this time it put him on the ""To:"" line and cc'd Levin. Problem solved, right? Sure, except by Thursday afternoon McCain had decided the reason Republicans were filibustering Hagel is that they are bitter about him saying they were wrong to support George W. Bush and Iraq.
This is all a dark comedy, really. Actually, more like a tragedy, because all this nonsense could have been avoided if a handful of Democrats hadn't killed filibuster reform last month. That's a mistake they can fix, however. Please sign the petition to tell Harry Reid: Re-open filibuster reform in light of continued Republican obstructionism.

376,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/06/16/1216376/-About-Jan-Brewer,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,About Jan Brewer...,"

Governor Jan Brewer (R/Teahadi-AZ) is getting a lot of really good press right now for having pushed Medicaid expansion through the more-or-less Tea Party controlled Arizona legislature. Admittedly, this is, in and of itself, an unabashedly good thing. Hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, the poorest and most at-risk among us, will no longer be without care. The safety net Arizona voted to give ourselves, AHCCCS, has been restored in a way that will improve our economy and shore up our state's still shaky finances. Regardless the motive, the outcome is a great thing.
That said, you can take this media redemption of Jan Brewer and stuff it. Chris Hayes, I'm looking at you.


Let's be clear, Jan Brewer is not an idiot. She may have been the rising star and darling of the far right of the Arizona Republican Party, but she's not a Black Helicopter Republican. Consider the gold coin bill. This pile of arble-garble had two reasons behind it. There was the reason that the national press got - the need to give opportunities to gold savers to spend their gold (which defeats the purposes of gold saving). Then there was the actual reason that circulated on the ground. OBAMA was going to spend so much money that the dollar was just going to continue inflating so much it would be useless, and Arizona needed to be prepared! Prepared, I say!!
Nevermind that the facts dictate that neither inflation nor federal spending have exactly been rocketing into the sun, they know.
The Black Helicopter Caucus has given us the Agenda 21 ban, forced oaths of loyalty, a pee bill (not joking, and neither were they), and defended your right to hate. Granted, this has provided Arizona with some excellent political entertainment. But walk through the Governor's signatures of these bills. The Agenda 21 ban? Signed. Pee bill? Killed in the House (due to global outrage turning it completely toxic, thanks everybody). The gold coin bill? Vetoed for technical reasons. But what Jan Brewer cares about is Jan Brewer. That lovely religious anarchy bill? She wrote in a letter that she regretted vetoing it, but she shot that hostage (and four more) dead to get AHCCCS expansion.
Now, to someone who has lived here for years, I feel the need to inform all of you who have not of a simple truth. Arizona is not normal. I do not mean ""weird"" the way most out of state folk mean it. I do not mean crazy. I mean there's the way the rest of the South runs, then there's how the South runs, and then there's Arizona. Arizonans like the political theater. We're the state that produced both Sinema and McCain, both Brewer and Grijalva. We expect them to be colorful, energetic, full of ideas and brilliant speeches, and if they are anything less, we tend to just stay home and let the other guy win.
Now, in terms of colorful, Jan Brewer is a damn rainbow. The electoral issue for her is to whom her colors appeal. Arizona's demographics are shifting at a breathtaking pace. The state is rapidly turning younger and browner, the electorate is moving steadily leftward on high-visibility issues. Now, were Jan Brewer running for governor again, she'd've taken the Medicaid money and not moved on immigratiion. But Brewer can't run for Governor, she's term limited. She can, however, run for McCain's seat in 2016.
Consider McCain's behavior. He's back to work on his legacy issue - immigration. On immigration, he reality checked his own party. On drones he all but body checked Rand Paul. He's monkeying in Syria, rumored to be scuttling Russian-American talks on the subject. McCain is spending political capital like a sailor spends cash, which only makes sense for one reason: he's getting done. McCain will be 80 when his term ends. Generic old at this age usually raises the r-word, but lest we forget, the man valiantly served his country under what can only be described as the most harrowing of circumstances, and carries the physical scars that go with it. I may not always agree with his politics, but he's generally proved himself to be an upright man whose convictions are real. He's earned the right to shore up his reputation, settle some old scores, and live out his days in well-earned peace on his Cornville ranch. That said, in my opinion, all signs point to Brewer burnishing her legacy in the hopes that in 2016 she'll be remembered more for Medicaid expansion than for SB1070, for denying DREAMers their licenses, for selling the Capitol, and on and on the list goes. The reason is simple - she is gambling that by the 2016 Senate race, if she can run as the Governor that worked across the aisle, she can force the Democrat to run negative against her, and Democrats do not win when we run negative.
There's only one catch. This strategy relies on collective amnesia. We would do well to let that stop being a feature of the American electorate. She's no less extreme and calculating a politician after Medicaid than before it, and the media, especially the liberal media, should remember all of her tenure, from 2009 to 2014, not from January til now. So America, do Arizona a favor - stop white-washing Jan Brewer. She doesn't deserve it.

In the wee hours of November 7th, long after President Obama had been declared the projected winner to serve his second term as the President of the United States, voters in Miami-Dade County in Florida finally got to cast their vote.
Their persistence and dedication to make their voices heard is admirable — but the circumstances that led to this injustice are anything but.
Join USAction and Florida Watch Action as we call on Governor Rick Scott and the Florida General Assembly to enact election reform without delay, including returning back to 14 days of early voting.


Two days after the election, Governor Rick Scott, who cut back early voting hours after his predecessor extended them, said, “well I’m very comfortable that the right thing happened.”1 Outrageous.
Reports of voters waiting up to 4 hours to vote and an estimated 201,000 voters who were discouraged from voting because of those long lines is far from the “right thing” happening — unless your goal of course, is to suppress the right to vote.2
Click here to tell Governor Rick Scott and your state legislators: We need election reform without delay, including returning back to 14 days of early voting.
Since he was elected, Governor Rick Scott has sought to make it increasingly more difficult for citizens to vote. First, he made registering voters prohibitively complicated.3 Then, he purged hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls, many of which were legally eligible to vote.4 And his final act to suppress the vote was to shorten early voting hours, including canceling the Sunday before Election Day, which historically, is a day that many African American churches take their members to the polls.5
The result was long lines on Election Day, discouraging many Floridians from voting. And it certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed that Rick Scott’s actions have targeted Hispanics, African Americans, seniors and young people — all of which tend to lean Democratic.
The right to vote in this country is fundamental to our Democracy. It is fundamental to what this country is founded on and since the inception of this country, we have consistently worked to extend that right to all Americans. That is, until now.
When President Obama gave his second inaugural address, he said, “Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.”6 We couldn’t agree more.

2010 was bad for many reasons, but perhaps worst among them was the boost it provided to GOP efforts to use gerrymandering to delay their slide into political irrelevance.
The GOP picked up 63 seats in the House and six in the Senate. And that was horrible. But the real damage was done at the state level, where they picked up 680 state legislative seats and 29 of the 50 governorships, including in key states such as Ohio, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They also held absolute control in half the state legislatures.
Thus, Republicans were able to not just solidify their control of the House, where they maintain a 33-seat advantage despite losing the House popular vote by one point in 2012, but they locked in control of myriad state legislatures. And you can just scroll down this site to see the damage those wingnut legislatures are wreaking across the country. Thus, we can't allow a repeat of 2020. Republicans are on the wane. The only way they can retain power is via voter suppression or gerrymandering. We must deny them both those options.
As you can see with this map, most states still redistrict via state legislatures, subject to a governor's veto. We have found the last few cycles that when a state deadlocks on drawing boundaries, a fair map designed by judges ends up benefiting Democrats, and even if it doesn't, fair is fair. So gaining the ability to merely block a map is generally a net gain for us.
Winning back heavily gerrymandered state legislatures is not always impossible, but is far more difficult than merely winning back governorships. So how are races in 2014 relevant to 2020? It's all about the power of incumbency.
Learn more about the power of incumbency below the fold.


We all know the power of incumbency, how elected officials are more likely to retain power than lose it at the hands of a challenger. So it's simple: Democrats retaking GOP-held seats in 2014 will run for re-election in 2018 with all the advantages of incumbency, and will be in office during the 2020 redistricting process (which actually happens in 2021, after census numbers are released).
And we're not talking just any governors, but governors of the most blatantly gerrymandered states: Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Texas, even, if you want to be extra optimistic. (North Carolina, another brutal gerrymander, won't be up until 2016.)
In Michigan, Republicans hold nine of 14 seats despite losing the state at the presidential level by 9.5 points.
In Wisconsin, Republicans hold five of eight seats despite losing the state by six points at the presidential level.
In Pennsylvania, Republicans hold 13 of 18 seats despite losnig the state by about 5 1/2 points at the presidential level.
In Florida, Republicans hold 17 of 27 seats despite narrowly losing the state at the presidential level.
In Ohio, Republicans hold 12 of 16 seats despite losing the state by three points at the presidential level.
(And hey, Virginia is outside the scope of this piece because its governors don't get to run for re-election, but Republicans hold eight of 11 seats despite losing the state by four points at the presidential level. And North Carolina, where Mitt Romney won narrowly, Republicans hold nine of 13 seats.)
We don't want to wait until 2022 to retake the House, and hopefully we won't. But we won't see a House that reflects the nation until we have rationally drawn districts. And we won't see that until we erase these gross gerrymanders.
Consider this: If the states listed above had 50-50-ish delegations, Democrats would gain 14 of the 17 seats they need for the majority. And given most of those states' politics, they shouldn't even be 50-50.
Those aren't the only states where the House delegation doesn't accurately reflect the state's partisan leanings. Those aren't the only governorships that matter. But they headline a year in which the battle for state houses truly matters far beyond the states themselves. Indeed, they'll have a serious impact on the shape for Congress well into the 20s.

Today's source material, thanks to the president's excellent trolling:

With the government shutdown over, President Obama took the opportunity to lecture his political opposition about the way government is supposed to work: he’s supposed to dictate, and others are supposed to remain silent.
President Barack Obama said no such thing, of course. What he actually said:
“I recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided. That's putting it mildly. That's OK. That's democracy. That's how it works. We can debate those differences vigorously, passionately, in good faith, through the normal democratic process. And sometimes we'll be just too far apart to forge an agreement.”
“You don't like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election. Push to change it. But don't break it. Don't break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building. That's not being faithful to what this country's about.”

Weird. ""Argue your position"" sounds nothing like ""remain silent""...
His core message was ""don't break democracy"" just because things didn't go your way. Sensible enough, right? But that dig about ""win an election""? It's sublime. It's taunting Republicans with something they are more and more incapable of doing by the passing day. So rather than say, ""Fine, we WILL win the next elections!"", they ... well, you can see for yourself below the fold.


We did win you dumb ass Obama. We elected people in the house to stop you. That's what elections are for and its not all about you and what you want.
This is kinda complicated, so I don't expect no teabagger to keep up: Democrats won the House popular vote by over 1 million. An artificial gerrymandered delivered a GOP majority. 50 teabaggers and their Senate papi effectively eliminated that GOP majority. So in the end, it was Democrats that made the House work.
From Reagan to Obama, in the past 8 Presidential Election cycles Republicans have won 5 times, and Democrats have won 3 times.
So, Mr. President. . . . .What's your point???

Popular vote winners:
Reagan
Reagan
Bush I
Clinton
Clinton
Gore
Bush II
Obama
Obama
That's nine presidential elections. Democrats won five of them. Better yet, Democrats have won five of the last six.
Still, I'm confused... Republicans get to throw tenter tantrums because Reagan was once president?
They did win elections! I know the DICTATOR doesnt respect the PEOPLES HOUSE but all of those republicans were elected and most of them campaigned on getting rid of his crappy healthcare law. He speaks of bipartisanship but his actions are totally the opposite. When Obama says WE WONT NEGOTIATE, how is that being bipartisan? He acts like a spoiled child. The reason he wont negotiate is because he simply doesnt know how to. He has never worked anywhere in the real world. He is a community organizer. He only knows how to rant and rave, picket and complain and beat his opponents into submission. Its like dealing with a child who just pisses and moans until the parent gives in. Unfortunately its been effective with this republican leadership that has little or no spine.The left's idea of compromise is that they get thier way no matter what. Compromise to them is simply to tell our side the we're really lucky that they didnt scew us even more. For example they say: We wanted a single payer system but we compromised with this free market solution by allowing private companies to be the insurance providers. We on the right hear them say: We could have went full blown communist on you but we compromised and only went socialist/facist on you.
Democrats NEVER compromise! Well, except that one time they compromised. And sure, it was a HUGE compromise because they did things the way WE wanted to, but, WHY WON'T THEY COMPROMISE?
1. We are not a democracy, we are a Constitutional Republic. 2. This is not a winner takes all political system. 3. You can only draw from a poisoned well so many times.
What about a well full of Tea Party Kool-Aid? When does that run out?
The most loyal voting bloc for the Dems. is the bloc of freeloading, panhandling, gimmee, gimmee, bums. It is tough to beat Santa Claus.
Why do people vote for people who are generous and kind and beloved and dedicated to bringing joy to the masses and kinda jolly? They should vote for Genghis Kahn instead.
If we ever have an honest election again, we need voter I.D., no illegal aliens, no dead voters, no one voting multiple times, no disallowing of the military vote, no district with over 100% voter turnout, you would not be so quick to say that
It was hard to cover up evidence of five million undocumented immigrants and dead voters voting!
STFU. I am your lord and god and thou shalt not oppose me. I'm growing tired of this whining little boy who really believes no one should criticize him. Grow up Little Man. We had thousands of Americans who died to free us from despots and I'll continue to speak out as long I have breath in my lungs.
Boy?
Phukin Ni****ER.
How many ""g""s does that racist think is in that word?
We did...they're called Tea Party Republicans in the House of Representatives. And there will be more after the 2014 mid-terms.
They won FIFTY elections in the House. Why won't Obama let them decide them everything?
IMPEACH OBAMA NOW! This illegal alien has committed at least 50 impeachable acts against the Constitution. He is a walking Hitler incarnate who will murder millions of Americans with his ""change"".
FIFTY? Adorable! Every teabagger member in the House chipped in with a fantasy impeachable act.
Our national elections are as rigged as anything in Stalin's USSR! The illegal alien Obama was never elected...he was SElected, twice; and his agenda is the total destruction of the USA and the murder of tens of millions. This will allow the confiscation of all our wealth by the Jewish international banking cartel so they can invest in that slave labor nation, China. George Soros and his band of Hebrew gangsters are pulling all of Obama's strings. They are merely the latest in the continuing sacking of the wealthiest nations on earth and the murder of millions. HITLER was financed and set up by Jewish banksters on Wall Street; and so is Obama!
It was right there on his ""issues"" page: the murder of tens of millions, and he was still selected president by the sheeple!
Obama: 'Go Out There and Win an Election' if You Want to Oppose My Agenda
Well...those WI Democrat Senators didn't seem to get that message, Mr. President.

You mean the ones that tried to effect change with ... elections?
From the communist sneaker who stole into the first term by hiding his past, and stole into the second using the IRS to suppress his opponents. And now he wants an election crony in the military in charge of DHS. Posse comitatus, destroyed from the top. Time for the jackboots.
Go to H377 you evil communist, Frank Marshall POTUS. Go to H377.

Go to hett?
If Oblamo throws the gauntlet down, the least we can do is accept the challenge.
We can start by primary'ing McConnell. Heck, even Ed Schultz wants McConnell around. Was slobbering over all the pork projects McConnell votes for.

I don't think Obama was talking about pri-- Ah hell, that's exactly what he was talking about: beating Mitch McConnell. Lamar Alexander too. And Susan Collins. You know what? Just go whole hog and primary all of them.
Republican won 230 elections, ya dumba$$.
With fewer votes than the Democrats who won about 201. Because that's what happens in republics, apparently.
Hey, Mr. Community Organizer. Just because conservatives lost the election and you won doesn't mean that they will allow you to destroy this country. The inept and incompetent Obama as President is so far in over his head on doing the job someone needs to step in and do the job right or at least the way it should be done.
Why rehash the GOP's 2012 election message, given how poorly it performed?
How about we just drag this fraud out of office and dispatch him as a traitor?
Obama: Win an election
Teabagger: Sorry no-can-do. Maybe sedition instead?  
Those are the most evil eyes I have ever seen.
I think he really is the Anti Christ .....
He gave himself away when he fought for expanded access to health care. Only Satan would want such evil.
Throw this guy out now while were still alive.
The Nuremberg trials will get this traitor sooner or later.
False flags will commence now , probably another this week for punishment .
He is evil.
It'll be pretty awesome when he's shipped back in time to 1946 to stand trial.
Yeah, sure, go try to win an election now that the dims have hacked the electronic voting system and have a completely untraceable way to modify the election results in any county they so desire. Just a few close counties flipped is all it will take. So, go ahead, try to win against that.
Democrats are so incompetent that they have a system to rig elections in completely untraceable ways ... AND FORGOT TO USE IT IN THE HOUSE!
I oppose you WITHOUT an election, you little puzzy!
Come and get me.
Hey Hey IRS
Look at what I said today!
IRS is busy. Can we stick you in a FEMA concentration camp instead?
The Black Socialist Dick #Obama and Ugly looking Communist Democrats are afraid of the ""New"" Tea Party taking over in 2016. Thanks to the Christian Extremists and the Almighty power of Jesus Christ the one and only King of ""ALL"" Kings & Lord of ""ALL"" Lords. Obama is a Loner!!!

Though Robert Sarvis is the announced Libertarian candidate who is reportedly pulling 10 percent of the vote in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, Republican Ken Cuccinelli likely has more to offer libertarians in the state than Sarvis. Libertarian Ron Paul and his son Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) think so, and both have endorsed Cuccinelli. 
Political analyst Tim Carney of the Washington Examiner, who often espouses the libertarian viewpoint, wrote Friday that Cuccinelli “would arguably be the most libertarian governor in the United States if he wins on Nov. 7,” a point that contrasts sharply with the fact that libertarians are attacking him. 
As Carney observes, Cuccinelli, as Virginia’s attorney general, was the first to challenge the constitutionality of ObamaCare’s mandates, taxes, subsidies, and infringements upon liberty.  
As governor, Cuccinelli’s plan is to cut the state income tax rate by 15 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations, creating an environment that is ripe for the free market. 
But libertarians should take note that Cuccinelli’s style is more “pro-economic growth” and less “pro-business,” as evidenced by the fact that his state’s business lobby has had its feathers ruffled by his stand against corporate welfare. Cuccinelli opposed the tax hikes that were sought by Northern Virginia developers to pay for roads and public services, and he pledged to cut the tax credits for special interest groups. 
In addition, Cuccinelli fought, while a state senator, to protect second amendment rights and, consequently, has an “A” rating from the NRA. He also opposed smoking bans when serving as a state senator. 
As Carney states, “Cuccinelli also often chooses government restraint over ‘law and order.'” 
Not afraid to oppose his own party, Cuccinelli, was the only Republican to vote against an expansion of the death penalty in 2009, even during a competitive primary for attorney general. 
Cuccinelli’s strong character was visible in his unwavering effort to exonerate Thomas Haynesworth, a black man who was wrongly convicted of rape and jailed for 27 years. Cuccinelli argued successfully to obtain a rare “writ of actual innocence,” which was possible because as a state senator, he had advocated for a law that would make such exoneration easier. 

Carney questions why, with Cuccinelli having libertarian bona fides, Ed Crane, former president of the Cato Institute, and other libertarians are supporting Sarvis and spending $300,000 on his campaign? 
He suspects, he says, that identity politics plays a role: 
I asked Sarvis why a libertarian should oppose Cuccinelli, and the first words out of his mouth were “social issues.” Crane’s only critique of Cuccinelli when announcing the $300,000 buy for Sarvis: “Ken Cuccinelli is a socially intolerant, hard-right conservative with little respect for civil liberties.” 
Cuccinelli is undoubtedly conservative. He’s an observant Catholic with seven children and a home-schooling wife. He’s a hero to the pro-life cause and an opponent of gay marriage. 
Libertarians, as a rule, support gay marriage, and most libertarians are pro-choice. But pro-life views fit within the libertarian framework: If you believe an in utero baby is a person, and if you believe the government has a legitimate role in protecting the innocent from violence, it’s logical to restrict abortion. 
And Cuccinelli, while unwavering in his moral opposition to abortion, is a moderate among Virginia Republicans when it comes to government restrictions on abortion: He worked behind the scenes trying to remove a GOP-created requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before getting an abortion. 
Carney gets to the crux of the matter, however, when he asserts, that “social liberals’ attack on Cuccinelli conflates his personal conservatism with his policy views.” 
The fact is that, while Cuccinelli might not personally agree with a law, he knows his job is to uphold the laws in his state. So, when he prosecuted a 47 year-old sexual predator who had sex with a minor, he defended his state’s “Crimes Against Nature” law but did not attempt to “ban sodomy” or homosexuality, as his critics say. He also has never attempted to “ban contraception,” as Planned Parenthood and its minions have charged. 
As Carney contends, Ken Cuccinelli may personally live a conservative lifestyle, but his record as both a state senator and attorney general is one that demonstrates that liberty is worth fighting for. Shouldn’t libertarians respect his choice to live as he does, while he also works to keep Virginians free?"

As most here know, the national Republican party has now officially endorsed a scheme to make it all but impossible for a Democrat to win the White House, by splitting up the electoral votes of states Obama won. Under the plan, Obama would have lost to Romney last November despite winning 5 million more votes:

But there is one way to stop this. And it takes a LOT of work from you, right now.


To prevent Republicans from rigging the electoral college, we must switch to a national popular vote. And it really can be done: states worth 132 electoral votes have already pledged to allot all of their EVs to the national popular vote winner if other states, adding up to 270 EVs, pledge to do the same. With 138 EVs to go, the electoral college would be overruled by the national popular vote by 2016.
According to the National Popular Vote Project, the following states have passed legislation to make the switch:
• California (55 EVs)
• Illinois (20)
• New Jersey (14)
• Washington (12)
• Massachusetts (11)
• Maryland (10)
• Hawaii (4)
• Vermont (3)
• DC (3)
These additional states now have Democratic governors and legislatures and can now pass an NPV law:
• New York (29 EVs)
• Minnesota (10)
• Colorado (9)
• Connecticut (7)
• Oregon (7)
• West Virginia (5)
• Rhode Island (4)
• Delaware (3)
Adding these states and their 74 EVs to the total would get us to 206 EVs with 64 to go. Rhode Island actually has a Republican-turned-independent governor, but they also have massive, veto-proof Democratic supermajorities in the state house and senate. West Virginia might be tough, given its preference for Republican presidents. And in New York, six Democrats in safe Democratic districts decided to give control of the senate to a Republican-independent coalition, even though Democrats have more senate seats. New Yorkers can debate in the comments the odds an NPV bill could pass there, or the odds the Democratic majority can retake control of the Senate in 2014.
To get the rest of the way to 270 will take ballot initiatives. Fortunately, polling shows Democrats, Republicans and independents all want to abolish the electoral college, by 66-30%, 61-30% and 63-29% margins, respectively. But we can expect Republican voters to change their minds once Fox News and the GOP echo chamber tell them it's an unconstitutional, undemocratic, anti-American liberal scheme. We can also hope Democratic and independent support rises once voters see what Republicans are plotting. Here, then, are states Obama won that have workable initiative processes and aren't listed above:
• Florida (29 EVs)*
• Ohio (18)*
• Michigan (16)*
• Nevada (6)
• Maine (4)
Asterisks denote states with Republican governors and legislators where a constitutional initiative would be necessary to prevent the legislature from overturning public will. Adding these states and their 73 EVs would total 279 EVs, 9 EVs past the goal.
There are also some long-shot states — red states with constitutional initiative processes — that we can fall back on in case some blue states prove intractable. Here they are, in order of narrowest 2012 loss for Obama:
• Arizona (11 EVs) -9% margin
• Missouri (10) -9%
• Mississippi (6) -12%
• Montana (3) -14%
• South Dakota (3) -18%
• North Dakota (3) -20%
• Nebraska (5) -22%
• Arkansas (6) -24%
• Oklahoma (7) -34%
So here's what needs to be done. The quick band-aid fix is to pass winner-take-all constitutional amendments in Florida, Ohio and Michigan to block the Republican strategy. These amendments would simply declare that all of the state's electoral votes must go to the winner. That obvious and simple proposal should be popular enough to win relatively easily, and could possibly foil the national GOP plot all on its own. The next step is to pass NPV initiatives in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Nevada and Maine.
We also need to contact the governors, legislatures and state Democratic parties in New York, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, West Virginia, Rhode Island and Delaware and not only get them on board but find powerful champions for the cause to make sure NPV laws pass. Alternatively, NPV initiatives can be passed in Colorado and Oregon.
We also need to contact the DNC to get them organizing with the states on NPV. Also, forward this info to your favorite local and national progressive blogs, columnists, TV and radio talk hosts, political leaders and advocacy organizations.
TALKING POINT:
Hi! As you may know, the national Republican party has endorsed a scheme to make it all but impossible for Democrats to win the White House, by splitting up the electoral votes of states Obama won. Under the plan, Obama would have lost to Romney last November despite winning 5 million more votes. ( tinyurl.com/gopscheme ) But there's one way to prevent this from happening, which is to switch from the electoral college to a national popular vote. Several states have already made the switch to a national popular vote. ( tinyurl.com/npvplan ) I'm urging you to please read about and support a switch in order to prevent Republicans from exploiting loopholes in the electoral college. Thank you very much!

Leading Off:
• RI-Gov: ""Path to victory"" is a phrase we use a lot around here, as in, does candidate X in race Y have any remotely plausible way of earning that brass ring? When you take a look at independent Gov. Lincoln Chafee's new poll numbers from PPP, though, you'll be hard-pressed to find one. Chafee, a former Republican, benefitted from a split field in 2010, where he was very probably to the left of an unlikable Democratic nominee and barely edged out the GOP candidate.
Now, like many other governors nationwide, Chafee's seen his job ratings drop precipitously (down to 59 percent disapproving and just 33 percent approving), thanks in part to years of a challenging economy, stubbornly high unemployment, and budget cuts—in other words, classic gubernatorial malaise. A man without a home, he's openly talked about joining the Democratic Party, but really, he's got nowhere to go. Tom Jensen summarizes:
• In four different scenarios testing four candidates—either Gina Raimondo or Angel Taveras on the Democratic side, either Brendan Doherty or Allan Fung on the Republican side, Chafee running as an independent, and Moderate Party candidate Ken Block—Chafee finishes third in every single one, running behind both the Democratic and Republican candidates.
• In two scenarios testing Chafee as the Democratic candidate, he finishes second, running 4 points behind the Republican candidates we tested, Brendan Doherty and Allan Fung.
• It would be difficult for Chafee to become the Democratic candidate anyway though. 35% of Democratic primary voters want Gina Raimondo to be their candidate next year to just 22% for Chafee, 19% for Angel Taveras, and 11% for Ernie Almonte.

PPP polled something like a dozen different configurations for this race, so I'm going to eschew our usual habit of laying them all out. (You can analyze them all in PPP's PDF.) But there's absolutely no good news in here for Chafee, which in a way is too bad, since Raimondo, the state treasurer and Democratic front-runner, seems to occupy ideological space to Chafee's right. She's made her mark cutting union pensions and is at the forefront of the austerity movement, even encouraging the creation of a shadowy ""pension overhaul"" group called EngageRI that won't release the names of its donors.
Providence Mayor Angel Taveras seems like the more progressive choice, and in a primary matchup without Chafee, he trails Raimondo 44-35, with former state Auditor Ernie Almonte at 9. So while Raimondo is tight with big-money interests, these numbers suggest Taveras could pose a real threat to her if he makes the race.
P.S. There's been strong movement in favor of gay marriage in Rhode Island, with voters now supporting it 57-36. To show you how fast the issue has moved, when PPP asked two years ago, the margin was 50-41 in favor. Hopefully these numbers will buttress marriage equality supporters as legislation to legalize same-sex marriage makes its way through the legislature (it's passed the House but conservative Democrats in charge of the Senate are making things very uncertain).
Senate:
• KS-Sen, -Gov: Republican Secretary of State Kris Kobach says he'll seek re-election to his current job in 2014, which is noteworthy only because it means he won't be issuing a primary challenge to either Gov. Sam Brownback or Sen. Pat Roberts, both of whom go before voters again next year.
• MA-Sen: Well, blargh. After hemming and hawing and even contradicting published reports saying he'd run for Senate, conservative Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch finally launched his campaign in the special election to succeed John Kerry. And Lynch's preferred campaign message is exactly as chip-on-the-shoulder as you'd expect. Indeed, seeing as he begins the race way behind in the polls against fellow Rep. Ed Markey, Lynch's only hope is to go negative. He's off to a fast start:
""It will be an uphill fight for me, but the fight is worth fighting. Shame on us to allow someone to clear the field, box out all the other candidates, and buy the election,"" said Lynch, in an apparent reference to Markey....
Lynch says Markey is an ""insulated person"" after 38 years in Congress.— @mlevenson via Twitter for iPhone


""People don't like the Democratic establishment... And I think that helps me,"" lynch says.— @mlevenson via Twitter for iPhone


Lynch says Markey backed by ""the Washington crowd"" and won't ""shake things up.""— @mlevenson via Twitter for iPhone


In addition to attacking Markey, Lynch undoubtedly will try to run to his right. Here's the first taste:
Lynch says Brown ""appealed to a certain group that I might appeal to as well.""— @mlevenson via Twitter for iPhone


Never mind that Elizabeth Warren handily beat Scott Brown without trying to clone his most cloying attributes, as Lynch prefers to do. In any event, the person Lynch is appealing to most right now is Brown himself, since the Republican former senator has to be licking his chops at the prospect of a nasty primary between the two Democrats. Brown still hasn't announced a decision, but surely this development can only make his entry more likely.
So what should Markey do now? Fortunately, he has two advantages: He's got a lot more money than Lynch, and he's got a terrific progressive profile. I don't think he necessarily has to respond in kind to Lynch. Rather, he can and should tout his credentials loudly in order to lock down the liberal vote, which still constitutes the majority of the primary electorate, despite what Lynch may believe. Lynch of course will have his union allies, but in a statewide primary like this, there are lots of votes out there for Markey to unearth.
Oh, and put up your freakin' website already. That would help.
P.S. Lynch also picked up the endorsement of the Iron Workers union—but seeing as he once was an iron worker himself, this is like Rudy Giuliani endorsing the Yankees. Still, it'll be worth watching to see whether any labor groups back Markey (this is the first union endorsement in the race), or whether Lynch will lock them all up.
• NJ-Sen: There was nothing in Al Capone's vault... but it wasn't Geraldo's fault. However, if the gasbag TV clown actually follows through and runs for Senate in New Jersey, it most definitely will be his fault. The most amazing thing? Geraldo, long berated as a lunatic liberal by FOX News types, wants to run as a Republican!
Gubernatorial:
• WY-Gov: I have to admit that while I can probably name the governors of all 50 states, I struggle to remember the name of the guy in charge of Wyoming. But (god bless Wikipedia) that would be Republican Matt Mead, elected in a landslide in 2010. Assuming he runs again, will he be re-elected next year? In ruby red Wyoming, you'd have to bank on it—unless, of course, he faces a primary challenge. And it looks like he's just earned one, though it's hard to tell how serious it is.
It turns out Mead just signed a bill that strips State Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill ""of leadership of the state Department of Education, reassigning those duties to a person appointed by the governor."" Hill is challenging the move in court, but I'm guessing the fact that Mead was able to shunt her aside via legislative maneuvering means Hill doesn't have a whole lot of friends in the establishment.
Other Races:
• OH-Treasurer: It's the news you've all been waiting for: DKE's least-favorite Republican of the 2012 cycle, Josh Mandel, says he'll seek re-election as state treasurer next year. Mandel, of course, was solidly thumped by Sen. Sherrod Brown, despite being the beneficiary of eleventy-zillion moneys spent on his behalf by outside groups. Of course, after first winning his current post in 2010, Mandel promised he wasn't looking for an immediate promotion, so I definitely won't trust his current pronouncement until the filing deadline passes. Hopefully we'll get to beat him again, though!
Grab Bag:
• DCCC, NRCC: Despite being deep in the minority, House Democrats outraised their GOP counterparts by a wide margin in the 2011-12 cycle: The DCCC took in $184 million versus $156 million for the NRCC. That probably helped the Democrats pick up seats, though of course the majority remains as elusive as ever. In any event, both parties started the year with $1.5 million in cash, while the D-Trip had slightly higher debt ($13.5 mil vs. $12 mil).
• Polltopia: If you're a careful poll-watcher, you've probably noticed what I've noticed over the last couple months, which is Rasmussen putting up strangely positive numbers for the Democrats, on presidential approval and especially on the generic House ballot. As far as the latter is concerned, they've been putting up take-back-the-majority type numbers with Dem leads in the high-single-digits, usually notably better than what other pollsters like PPP are finding. Well, Harry Enten has noticed too, and he takes Rasmussen to task for it.
You might be thinking that Rasmussen is consciously overcompensating for its overly-Republican results over the previous few cycles by putting a thumb on the scales in the Dems' direction, but it's not that simple; instead, it looks like they're just committing the same methodological problems that have always plagued them, but in the wake of a solid 2012 election for the Dems, that leads Rasmussen down the same screwed-up path but in the opposite direction.
Instead of weighting based on demographics using Census data like good pollsters usually do, Rasmussen continues to weight based on party ID in the last election (a bad idea, because party ID isn't an immutable characteristic but one that fluctuates easily based on who's up and who's down politically). Dems had a six-point edge in 2012 exit polls in 2012. So, now we've got a weighted sample in Rasmussen polls that's 38 D, 32 R: maybe right for a presidential election, but overly rosy for a midterm. (David Jarman)
• Texas: PPP has some Lone Star State miscellany, asking their usual gay marriage and sports questions. (Did you ever imagine there'd be a pollster with an equal interest in both topics? This is why Tom Jensen is awesome.) GOP Sen. Ted Cruz's first job approval ratings are pretty meh, at 36-30, but that actually gives him the highest net approval of any statewide elected official PPP's tested there. Meanwhile, as you'd expect, most Texans are opposed to same-sex marriage, by a 55-35 margin, but 61 percent support some form of legal recognition once you include civil unions.

They still don't understand what the hell is wrong with you people



They still don't understand what the hell is wrong with you people

Thank whatever deity you pray to, or none at all, that these wretched people are nowhere near the White House.
In their first interview since the Great Shellshocking of 2012, Mitt and Ann allow Chris Wallace into one of their many homes so they can wax philosophical about the defeat everyone outside of their delusional bubble knew was coming, and Ann takes this opportunity to assure us that yes, she's still quite disappointed in you people for not seizing the great opportunity to let her husband regularly insult you from the Oval Office.
Wallace joins them in La Jolla, which is in California, which is, as Mitt informed us during the election, almost as much of a hellhole as Europe because taxes. Which is why he owns a beach front mansion there, of course. That would be the beach front mansion they're turning into a bigger beach front mansion, complete with car elevator, with the assistance of the private lobbyist they hired to fast-track their construction plans, like all totally normal average Americans do.
Yeah, don't you miss these people so much? If you do, head below the fold for lots of delusions, plus Ann's tear of sorrow for you people.


So what has Ann been doing with her time since she stopped traveling around the country to tell you people what ingrates you are for not appreciating her husband? She's been crying, of course—big fat crocodile tears of sorrow for you and your missed opportunity:
ANN ROMNEY: It was a crushing disappointment. Not for us. Our lives are going to be fine. It's for the country.
WALLACE: Is it true you began to cry?
ANN ROMNEY: I did, of course. Yes. Very disappointed.

Ann and her eleventy billion houses and her fancy horse and her two Cadillacs will be just fine, thank you very much, but as for the rest of the country ... Ann weeps for you. A lot:
WALLACE: So let me ask you about the months from November until now, were there tears?
ANN ROMNEY: Oh, for me, yes. I cried. When you pour that much of your life and energy and passion into something and you're disappointed by the outcome, it's very -- it's sad. It's very hard.

Remember, those tears of self-pity, because it's very hard to lose, are not for her. They're for you, America. For you.
WALLACE: Mrs. Romney, as we sit here right now, have you gotten over the defeat? Or is that going to take more time?
ANN ROMNEY: I think it takes time. I think I'm mostly -- you know, the great ""Princess Bride"" line, ""mostly dead.""
I'm mostly over it. But not completely.
And you have moments where you, you know, go back and feel the sorrow of the loss. And so, yes, I think we're not mostly dead yet.

She may be mostly dead, but she's nowhere near done whining about it:
ANN ROMNEY: You never like it. And I never like it. And I -- you know, I'm like a she-lion when it comes to defending Mitt. And I know -- I know his heart; I know his abilities. I know he would have been a fabulous president and I mourn the fact that he's not there.
And it would have been -- it would have been much better for America, I believe, in my heart if he had been there right now.

 
Damn you, America! But at least she's not bitter. Not like, say, her husband:
MITT ROMNEY: The president had the power of incumbency. ObamaCare was very attractive, particularly to those without health insurance. And they came out in large numbers to vote. So that was part of a successful campaign.
Curse that sneaky president and his popular policies that made people want to vote for him instead of the guy who called them a bunch of deadbeat takers! Oh, plus, also having a better campaign that everyone except the Romneys could see:
I think they had a better ground game. And I think we were not aware -- you know, we certainly had the passion coming from our side, and I don't think we were as aware of the passion that was coming from the other side. I think we were a little blindsided by that.
Yeah, it sure it surprising when all the polls turn out to be right and Karl Rove is wrong.
Also, Ann thinks the media and the Obama campaign were very unfair to her husband because he's a swell guy—no, really, he is!—and yet, for some reason, no one saw that.
WALLACE: Do you think the media was in the tank for Barack Obama?
(LAUGHTER)
ANN ROMNEY: I think that it's -- anytime you're running for office, you always think that you're being portrayed unfairly.
And, you know, we -- of course, on our side believe that there's more bias in favor of the other side. I think that that's a pretty universal -- universally-felt opinion.
WALLACE: What do you think of the campaign that Barack Obama ran?
ANN ROMNEY: I think, obviously, it was a winning campaign. It worked.
WALLACE: Do you think it was fair?
ANN ROMNEY: No.
WALLACE: In what way?
ANN ROMNEY: Portrayal of my husband. He is an exceptional, wonderful person.
(LAUGHTER)
MITT ROMNEY: She's not biased at all.
ANN ROMNEY: I'm not biased! And, you know, and he -- I mean, he really is a selfless person that really, truly cared about the American people. He truly cares about making a difference and about helping others. And for him to be portrayed in a very negative light in another way was very hard.
He has enormous skill set in dealing with difficult issues and I totally believe at this moment if Mitt were there in the office, that we would not be facing sequestration right now.

If Mitt were president, there would be no sequester. Also, no war, no debt, no terrorism, no child would go to bed hungry at night, it would never rain on your wedding day, and everyone would have a pony. Two ponies! Because Mitt's that good. See what you're missing, America? DO YOU GET IT NOW?!?!?
Because Ann can't stop talking, Wallace then speaks with Mitt separately. He explains how Obama sucks because if Mitt were president, we wouldn't have the sequester, and also, Mitt totally worked with Democrats that one time he was governor, so, ya know. He woulda fixed all those problems by now. And as for all those awful things Mitt couldn't stop saying during the election? He didn't mean them anyway:
Yes, it was a very unfortunate statement that I made. It's not what I meant. I didn't express myself as I wished I would have.
Yup. That's the Mitt we all knew and despised—the guy who would say anything and then insist it's not what he meant anyway. Really a shame he's not our president now, isn't it?

Conservative proof that this is a conservative nation.



Conservative proof that this is a conservative nation.

As I noted last week, those unskewers in the conservative movement are working overtime to dispel the mathematical certainty of their demographic predicament. This is particularly important as they try and push House Republicans into killing immigration reform.
So you get stuff like this:
No, the 2012 election didn’t prove the Republican Party needs a reboot
You'd think that losing by five in the national presidential popular vote (despite a lousy economy), losing the House popular vote, and losing Senate seats in a year where Democrats were almost entirely on defense would be a powerful signal that maybe things are amiss in conservative land. But nope! Never underestimate the right-wing power to bend reality to their whims. Let's head below the fold for the mental gymnastics.



It is hard to defeat an incumbent even in a slowly growing economy, and we could easily chalk up Romney’s loss to that fact.
So, Romney was always going to lose, even though they had all convinced themselves (even Romney!) of their impending victory. Hence, if you expect to lose, don't change anything! Just keep doing the things that made you expectedly lose.
Although over time both Romney and Obama were perceived as moving farther away from the average voter, Romney was still closer to this voter on Election Day.  The candidate who would have benefited most from a shift to the center was Obama.
Republicans don't need to shift to the center. Democrats do! And the evidence is some YouGov chart that proved that Obama should've talked to the center. Instead, he didn't. And unfortunately for him (and lucky for Republicans!) Obama won.
If only he had shifted, all of this could've been avoided!
It is certainly true that Americans are moving left on some issues—most notably same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization.  But Obama did not win the election because America is becoming more liberal, he won it despite the fact that America has become more conservative [...]
Far from ushering in a liberal majority, the Obama administration has presided over a shift among Americans toward preferring less government, not more government.  Obama has helped to increase the overall conservatism of the American public more than Reagan ever did, ironically enough.

Go down every single issue—every one!—and Democrats lead Republicans. Yet this unskewer takes data from a single model to claim that America has become ""more conservative"" because they want smaller government.
After Ronald Reagan's second term ... George H.W. Bush got elected. If Reagan made America ""more liberal"", America had a funny way of showing it. And if Obama made Americans more conservative, it only stands to reason that they'd reelect him again, right?
Fact is, the Democrats remain firmly in the American majority on every issue of note. So, if conservatives want to argue that some random chart proves that America is with them, they can knock themselves out. In the real world, things look a lot different.
The GOP will also benefit from what political scientist Alan Abramowitz calls the “time for a change” factor: only once since the 22nd Amendment limited the president to two consecutive terms has a party held the White House for more than two terms in a row.
Past performance is no indicator of future results. And that's doubly so in electoral politics, where the sample size is so small. I mean, the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951, so we're talking a sample of just 16 presidential elections.
perhaps we’ll realize that all this talk of a “liberal majority” or “Obama’s mandate” or even a “Democratic realignment” was overblown.  And perhaps we’ll even remember that the exact opposite argument was made in 2004, when evil genius Karl Rove was supposed to have ushered in a Republican realignment and Democrats would never win another election unless they could appeal to “values voters.”  Those predictions of a Republican majority were soon proved false.
Those predictions were false because they weren't rooted in data, but ideology. The GOP didn't win in 2004 because of value voters, but because of warmongering. The ""ideas"" that people assumed drove the American public were bullshit—even then, big majorities of Americans believed in sensible gun restrictions, higher taxes for the rich and corporations, and protecting Social Security and Medicare. The only major social issue in which we were the minority was marriage equality, and even that's no longer the case.
Current discussions of the future electoral dominance of Democrats isn't based on ideology or perceptions of what the American people believe. Rather, they are based on the cold hard math of demographics. Our base groups are growing and becoming more Democratic. Theirs are dying off (even as they become more Republican). It's that simple.
So it's interesting to see that in an entire piece by a bunch of political scientists trying to convince us that 2012 didn't prove squat, there isn't a single mention of demographics. Not even in passing. That stunning omission is the written equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears and screaming, ""la la la I can't hear you!""
But hey, some random thing said America is more conservative and that Obama should've tacked to the center, so all's cool!

Even conservatives want to leave the God stuff out of government.



Even conservatives want to leave the God stuff out of government.

Hmmm...
FreedomWorks commissioned a national survey of registered voters last month, shared first with POLITICO, that finds 78 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents self-identify as fiscally conservative and socially moderate [...]
The poll asked Republican voters what they are most interested in: 40 percent said “individual freedom through lower taxes and reducing the size and scope of government,” 27 percent picked “traditional values” and 18 percent chose a “strong national defense.""

Freedomworks is pushing this poll in support of its ""defund the government if Obamacare isn't killed"" effort. Per their telling, Republicans want their elected officials to ""stick to their principles"" and not compromise with Democrats. But on social issues? Forty-one percent of Republicans don't rank gay marriage as a top-10 issue, and only a third rank abortion as a top-3 issue (another third ranks it top-10, and the last third doesn't give a shit).
It's one poll, but it seems to confirm trends inside the GOP's strife-torn tent. The neocons are on the outs. We first saw it with the sequester—where the $800 billion in defense cuts was supposed to prod the GOP to negotiate in good faith for a grand bargain. Instead, the bulk of the GOP nodded in approval and left the military-industrial complex slack-jawed, abandoned despite the mounds of campaign cash they shipped into GOP coffers. But their irrelevance has only been confirmed with the Syria debate, with war hawks grossly outnumbered even inside their own caucus. (Sure, support would be higher with a Republican administration, but that's cold comfort for a crew who exist to bomb shit in the Middle East.)
The Theocons are being marginalized by a society that left them behind a long time ago. And while the 2013 ""rebranding"" efforts have failed, they'll be back the next time Republicans lose a national election. And fact is, they're not going to get single women and youth voters without chucking the Religious Right's agenda overboard. It's inevitable. And if Freedomwork's poll is to be believed, doing so would actually be popular within the GOP.
The ""Jesus rode a dinosaur"" nuts may be loud but not loved, not even by their supposed allies.

Buried deep in today's New York Times article about conservative and business groups descending on Capitol Hill next week to try to convince reluctant Republican House members to support immigration reform, you'll find this piece of nastiness from Representative Steve King (R-IA):
“We have seen the character of this president, and the way that he does business,” said Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, explaining why he will oppose any measure.
Steve King, who has characterized Latinos and Hispanics as dope dealers, their calves enlarged to the size of cantaloupes from lugging narcotics across the Rio Grande, will never support any serious reform of immigration policy. But his willingness to publicly disparage the President's character in such an insulting manner says as much about the GOP's prospects in 2016 and beyond as it does about King.
A push to bring immigration legislation to the House floor, led by an unusual coalition of business executives, prominent conservatives and evangelical leaders, threatens to create another schism in the Republican Party and could have a noticeable effect on campaign contributions before the midterm elections.
The intense lobbying effort is spearheaded by 600 Republican big donors, among them ""conservative leaders in business, agriculture and religion,"" as well as executives of technology companies, all hoping to convince 80 or so Republican Congressmen to sign on to meaningful immigration reform. Some are threatening to shut off their cash spigot to Republican candidates if reforms are not passed. The primary motivation of these ""conservative leaders,"" however, is not to provide a ""path to citizenship"" for undocumented immigrants but to secure cheap labor and fatten their wallets.  As one self-professed ""Tea Party"" supporter in the farming industry puts it:
“You wake up and it is 25 degrees, and a cow that is giving birth, and you have 400 cows to milk that day, and you don’t have the help you need — that stinks,” Mr. Jones said, citing a shortage of labor that he says could be eased through a new immigration law. “I bet not one of those legislators back there have been in that position.”
Mr. Jones is absolutely correct. Few if any of the rabid Tea Party House members have the experience of milking cows in 25 degree weather, and even fewer of their constituents have. What the Tea Party House members are experienced in, and what their constituents crave, is sticking it to the arrogant black President. Steve King's disrespect and contempt towards President Obama illustrates this beautifully.  
The contention centers on what to do with the illegal immigrants already in the country, which Democrats in both chambers say must be addressed in any final deal. Many House Republicans have already expressed support for proposals to strengthen border security and make it easier for high-skilled workers and farm laborers to get visas, all elements of the Senate package.
So Republicans are trapped. Their natural instincts are to jump when big business says jump. And big business is saying that. But the President and the Democrats hold the trump card -- any meaningful reform has to be accompanied by a path to citizenship and fairer treatment of undocumented immigrants.  How to explain that to a base of voters that reacts violently to the slightest suggestion of compromise?  In districts where (by and large) there is no meaningful Hispanic or Latino presence to drive the debate? The short answer is --you can't.  The Tea Party has already demonstrated it has complete control of the Republican House's agenda. They shut the government down and brought the country to the brink of default over a hopeless effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the President's signature achievement. King's remarks about the President's ""character"" reflect the failure of that effort.  The idea that they would support any type of legislation the President supports that hasn't even passed yet is simply laughable.
Pushing back against the pressure to act from within their own party, a core group of conservatives said in interviews this week that they would not be intimidated by corporate America or other outside parties, even though in this case that includes farmers, evangelical leaders and some prominent conservatives.
We've already seen prominent Republicans laying the groundwork for their retreat on this issue with the lame excuse that the President's refusal to abandon his health care law undermined the prospects for immigration reform. They've even begun to commission artfully crafted polls to reassure themselves that there is no urgency on the issue.  Of course, if the GOP were thinking rationally, the only factor worth considering would be Hispanics' and Latinos' increasingly hostile feelings towards their party.
But they're not thinking rationally. They're thinking like Steve King, blinded by their own contempt for the President.  And they've convinced themselves that they can keep kicking the can down the road:
 
A growing number of Republicans, however, privately say they see no political advantage for the party to move ahead on immigration legislation right now. They do not expect it to be a critical issue in the 2014 midterms — in fact, some House Republicans may be even more reluctant to take a tough vote on immigration during an election year — and they say it simply needs to be dealt with before the 2016 presidential election. Thus, they say, they are most optimistic about pushing through an overhaul in 2015.
They can tell themselves they'll pass something in 2015, but it's hard to understand how or why--or what. After all, even in 2015 the President will still be black.

In another installment of things Republicans say that are so stupid you just can't make them up, Washington state rep Ed Orcutt, a Republican, claimed in an email to a constituent regarding a bike tax he supported, that bicycles were bad for the environment because they caused cyclists to have “an increased heart rate and respiration"".
Reached for comment, he added that:
“You would be giving off more CO2 if you are riding a bike than driving in a car,”
Seriously, he said these things, according to the Seattle Bike Blog.



Apparently a constituent, Dale Carlson, owner of a bicycle store in Tacoma, WA, sent him an email opposing a proposal that Orcutt supported that would impose an additional sales tax on bicycles on top of regular sales tax (which is already the highest in the country in WA at over 9%), in order to pay for the roads that cyclists use that Orcutt claimed (wrongly) they don't pay for at present. So Orcutt sent him an email in response, in which he justified the new tax, in part by claiming that cyclists generate more pollution than cars.
State lawmaker defends bike tax, says bicycling is not good for the environment
Posted on March 2, 2013 by Tom Fucoloro   
Representative Ed Orcutt (R – Kalama) does not think bicycling is environmentally friendly because the activity causes cyclists to have “an increased heart rate and respiration.”
This is according to comments he made in an email to a constituent who questioned the wisdom of a new bike tax the legislature is considering as part of a large transportation package.
We spoke with Rep. Orcutt to confirm the email’s authenticity and to get further clarification.
“You would be giving off more CO2 if you are riding a bike than driving in a car,” he said. However, he said he had not “done any analysis” of the difference in CO2 from a person on a bike compared to the engine of a car (others have).
“You can’t just say that there’s no pollution as a result of riding a bicycle.”

Someone please tell me this was snark. Please, I beg you.
In any case, putting aside these, ahem, deep thoughts about cycling, pollution and the environment, Orcutt is also wrong on the notion that cyclists don't pay for the roads that they ride on, that he claims drivers do.
First, the majority of funds that go towards building and maintaining roads, including bike lanes, comes from general revenue, not gas or vehicle taxes or license and registration fees, which everyone, including cyclists, pays into, via sales, property, income and other taxes--some of them not local or even state, but federal.
Second, to the extent that vehicle-related taxes and fees pay for roads, the vast majority of cyclists also own and drive vehicles, and pay these taxes and fees as much as non-cyclists.
And third, the wear and tear that bicycles impose on public roads is miniscule verging on infinitesimal compared to that imposed on them by cars, motorcycles and trucks. Powered vehicles weigh anywhere from hundreds to thousands of pounds. Most bikes weigh anywhere from 15 to 40 pounds. Do the math, even if you include the weight of the driver.
I wonder if Mr. Orcutt has done an analysis of how much pollution is caused by Republicans opening their mouths or attempting to use their brains?

In another installment of things Republicans say that are so stupid you just can't make them up, Washington state rep Ed Orcutt, a Republican, claimed in an email to a constituent regarding a bike tax he supported, that bicycles were bad for the environment because they caused cyclists to have “an increased heart rate and respiration"".
Reached for comment, he added that:
“You would be giving off more CO2 if you are riding a bike than driving in a car,”
Seriously, he said these things, according to the Seattle Bike Blog.



Apparently a constituent, Dale Carlson, owner of a bicycle store in Tacoma, WA, sent him an email opposing a proposal that Orcutt supported that would impose an additional sales tax on bicycles on top of regular sales tax (which is already the highest in the country in WA at over 9%), in order to pay for the roads that cyclists use that Orcutt claimed (wrongly) they don't pay for at present. So Orcutt sent him an email in response, in which he justified the new tax, in part by claiming that cyclists generate more pollution than cars.
State lawmaker defends bike tax, says bicycling is not good for the environment
Posted on March 2, 2013 by Tom Fucoloro   
Representative Ed Orcutt (R – Kalama) does not think bicycling is environmentally friendly because the activity causes cyclists to have “an increased heart rate and respiration.”
This is according to comments he made in an email to a constituent who questioned the wisdom of a new bike tax the legislature is considering as part of a large transportation package.
We spoke with Rep. Orcutt to confirm the email’s authenticity and to get further clarification.
“You would be giving off more CO2 if you are riding a bike than driving in a car,” he said. However, he said he had not “done any analysis” of the difference in CO2 from a person on a bike compared to the engine of a car (others have).
“You can’t just say that there’s no pollution as a result of riding a bicycle.”

Someone please tell me this was snark. Please, I beg you.
In any case, putting aside these, ahem, deep thoughts about cycling, pollution and the environment, Orcutt is also wrong on the notion that cyclists don't pay for the roads that they ride on, that he claims drivers do.
First, the majority of funds that go towards building and maintaining roads, including bike lanes, comes from general revenue, not gas or vehicle taxes or license and registration fees, which everyone, including cyclists, pays into, via sales, property, income and other taxes--some of them not local or even state, but federal.
Second, to the extent that vehicle-related taxes and fees pay for roads, the vast majority of cyclists also own and drive vehicles, and pay these taxes and fees as much as non-cyclists.
And third, the wear and tear that bicycles impose on public roads is miniscule verging on infinitesimal compared to that imposed on them by cars, motorcycles and trucks. Powered vehicles weigh anywhere from hundreds to thousands of pounds. Most bikes weigh anywhere from 15 to 40 pounds. Do the math, even if you include the weight of the driver.
I wonder if Mr. Orcutt has done an analysis of how much pollution is caused by Republicans opening their mouths or attempting to use their brains?

What's the profit motive for the supposed global climate change fraud?

faith in the infallibility of scientists is unwarranted and naive. They made mistakes. They created models based on their theory of a CO2 driven climate. The models failed.

This James Hansen? The one who just quit NASA so he could be more free to fight against greenhouse emissions and the Keystone Pipeline? That one?
when those that scream loudest about it start changing their lifestyles and become practitioners instead of preachers, we might follow suit. flying around the world to accept an award for spreading the word about global warming w/o the slightest bit of self awareness is what sinks. the credibility of the face of the movement and the movement itself.
Al Gore fat, therefore global warming is a hoax!
Three words for you Al, NOT A METEOROLOGIST. You have a degree in communications. You have NO SCIENCE BACKGROUND WHATSOEVER!!! So now we have two guys named Al with absolutely no scientific education, no scholarly research papers or anything else for that matter, telling us all about a very complicated scientific issue. Hey Als, go back to school and get some street cred!
If only every climate scientist was as scientifically educated as James Inhoff. Or every commenter at Breitbart.
1. It wasn't a super storm. It was a Cat 1 hurricane that hit an unprepared socialist city with decaying infrastructure.
2. So what? One storm is weather, not climate as the global warming nut jobs always try and remind us anyhow.
And someone warn Wall Street about all that socialism in their city, which gets hit by Cat 1 hurricanes all the time.
Al is just like all the other global warming advocates. Uninformed and unwilling to question the status quo. Al needs to look at the real science of global warming not the propaganda being spewed by the likes of Mikey Mann, a proven fraud.
As we all know, reality has a well-known liberal bias! Good thing conservatives are willing to question reality!
It may well be warming but that doesn't mean it's a problem. Alarmists freaked out about the same thing, a melting Arctic, at the beginning of the '20th century. The Vikings were able to sail the northern seas all the way to Canada, naming a now ice covered land mass ""Greenland"" along the way. England during the same time had a wine industry.
Um. Greenland wasn't green when the Scandinavians settled there. It was a play to convince settlers to travel there. And the British Isles still have a wine industry, though it was decimated in the early 20th century by ... WWI. The Brits had more important things to grow in a time of war.
Another mentally diseased democrat.......too bad we can not send him to the real culprit.....the Sun.
Too bad he can't be murdered by the ""sanctity of life"" crowd!
The massive cathredals of Europe, built to seat thousands (who actually once used them) are now open at times for only 6 or 8 people. Saw it.
Meanwhile, MILLIONS of Cyclopsean Europeans march around entranced by global warming.
Their leaders LOVE it--it keeps those in charge, in charge. And it STRENGTHENS their stranglehold on the Volk.
So that's the motive behind the supposed global climate change hoax? To subvert religion? If that's the case, the Germans might want to stop taxing its citizens on behalf of the church.
In the name of efficiency, you know.
Ask the folks in the UK about global warming. The UK summer began last Sunday. Snow, wind, and extreme cold embracing the UK. Roker is an idiot.
Ah yes, the ""it snowed that one time"" argument!
I could never vote for a political party that relies primarily on fear and lies to advance themselves...
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Being so educated you would think he absorbed enough weather history to know where his fat ass is sitting now was covered by a glacier. Then it melted. Then it came back......melted again...for hundreds of thousands of years. He would probably blame mastodon flatulence.
Luckily, we didn't have civilization back then, huh? Seems it would be worth avoiding those things now that we're around.
Got one word for him...zealot.
This is their religion...they worship at the alter of government. Their penance is through PC policing, and they use the environment as a tool of conversion.
The Earth doesn't need saving. One good earthquake, super volcano, or asteroid and we're gone. All this clap trap is for those who have given up morality and the laws of God to give their life meaning and purpose and like everything else...zealotry has overridden common sense.

We can trash the planet because of the rapture.
Stand up to the insane liberal agenda! Though there are many people who have been successfully indoctrinated by contemptuous professors and news media, there are still many other people out there who can reason and exercise common sense. You are absolutely not alone!
The fringe has company.
What's more disturbing, in light of the facts that support the notion that global warming is a hoax, is that it is a lowly 37%. That is scarey when you understand that there is no evidence at all that the earth is getting warmer and in fact may be cooling. Actually, it isn't just a hoax, it's a freaking scam on the world.
And it's true because he said so!
Any scientific finding that requires massive unprecidented growth in government is a hoax. You can take that to the bank.
The data would totally look different if tax cuts were the solution!
How about one word, ""Chemtrails"". This guy is an idiot, just like AlGorezeera.
Yeah, I had to look that one up. It's a good one!

Hell is indeed freezing over and angels are dancing and popping corks everywhere. In an August 1st op-ed in the New York Times, former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency William D. Ruckelshaus (1970 to 1973, 1983 to 1985), Lee M. Thomas (1985 to 1989), William K. Reilly (1989 to 1993), and Christine Todd Whitman (2001 to 2003) make the Republican Case for Climate Action.
First, they say denial is not a river in Egypt and it's time for Republicans to stop acting like stubborn 15-year olds clinging to their belief in Santa Claus.  
There is no longer any credible scientific debate about the basic facts: our world continues to warm, with the last decade the hottest in modern records, and the deep ocean warming faster than the earth’s atmosphere. Sea level is rising. Arctic Sea ice is melting years faster than projected.
They then go on to tout President Obama's Climate Action Plan, urging their Congress critters to endorse it and ""start the overdue debate about what bigger steps are needed and how to achieve them — domestically and internationally.""
Yowza!!
More below the orange sluice of reality...



They talk about some of the important environmental policies that they pushed through in their days to clean up the air and the water (remember when Republicans did constructive things?), giving their Republican contemporaries some no-nonsense tutoring on how to be leaders and govern.
When confronted by a problem, deal with it. Look at the facts, cut through the extraneous, devise a workable solution and get it done.

They spell out for their fellow Republicans what the rest of the world and sane people in this country have known for quite some time now, basically borrowing Meteor Blades' delay is denial playbook.
We can have both a strong economy and a livable climate. All parties know that we need both. The rest of the discussion is either detail, which we can resolve, or purposeful delay, which we should not tolerate.
While you're at it, these high profile Republicans seem to say to their chickenhawk colleagues, don't just evolve a little bit towards being a timid non-denier, don't just get on board with the President's proposal, but help to work towards the much bolder actions and solutions that we need to implement to give us a chance to have some sort of a livable future on planet Earth.
Mr. Obama’s plan is just a start. More will be required. But we must continue efforts to reduce the climate-altering pollutants that threaten our planet. The only uncertainty about our warming world is how bad the changes will get, and how soon. What is most clear is that there is no time to waste.

PS: If you're in the Bay Area and want to do something, I just got this email from 350BayArea.org:
This week your voice and presence matter on the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline.

Wednesday, August 7, at 9:45 am
Bay Area Air Quality Management District Board vote on Keystone XL Pipeline Resolution.
Three things you can do
- Be there if you can this Wednesday. RSVP to attend the meeting
- Call Board Members on Monday and Tuesday - ask them to support the Resolution
- Sign 350 Bay Area's BayCAP Petition asking the Air District to declare that climate disruption is an escalating emergency and enact a program to achieve deep cuts in Bay Area greenhouse gas emissions. They have the power, but they're not using it. (Read more)
Make sure your your representative on the Air District Board votes to oppose the Keystone XL Pipeline.
Quick talking points:
Keystone will add up to 1.2 billion metric tons of carbon pollution to the atmosphere over the 50-year lifespan of the project.
According to EPA and State Department estimates, carbon emissions resulting from the burning of Alberta tar sands are 81 percent higher than those from conventional oil on a well-to-tank basis.

Nothing “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson said was anything close to anti-gay. It might have been characteristically blunt, but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual behavior, including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians. 
When you have major media outlets declaratively describing Robertson’s expression of his Christian beliefs as “anti-gay,” what you are really seeing is major media outlets outing themselves as anti-Christian. 
Politico. CNN. The Hollywood Reporter. Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo. Variety. And so on…
Robertson listed more than a half-dozen sins other than homosexual behavior, including a number of heterosexual behaviors, and “the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers”. 
It is certainly possible to try to disguise anti-gay bigotry as Christianity. Singling out gay people and not distinguishing between homosexuals as people and homosexual behavior are two of the most glaring examples. 
But Robertson did neither. What he did do was to speak a Christian truth about various sins, and the media know this. 
Anti-sin is not anti-gay. 
But because the media and left are desperate to toxify Christianity as bigotry and bully Christians into silence, Robertson’s remarks are seen as the perfect opportunity to do both. 
Of course it is an added benefit to the media to try to tarnish a culturally conservative mega-hit, and maybe drive it off the air. 
What we have here is nothing more than the media practicing McCarthyism and disguising it as tolerance. 
Notice how the media are not reporting on the most important thing Robertson said:
You put in your article that the Robertson family really believes strongly that if the human race loved each other and they loved God, we would just be better off. We ought to just be repentant, turn to God, and let’s get on with it, and everything will turn around.
Governor Sarah Palin put this exactly right when she said this is an attack on “all of us.” 
 

This post has been updated to add a correct Robertson quote about loving the human race.

If anyone wants to argue that the same government currently forcing religious institutions to purchase the abortion pill through ObamaCare will not eventually use civil rights violations in order to attempt to force the Church to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies — good luck with that.  
But this would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
It was just three months ago that the White House and media piled on a reverend for preaching the Bible’s teachings on homosexuality. The result was his invitation to speak at Obama’s inauguration being rescinded. 
This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
With the election of Pope Francis, we have news anchors openly clamoring that the Church is out of step on same-sex marriage.
This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
Fifteen years ago, the same leftists and media assuring us today that same-sex marriage won’t be imposed on the Church were telling us that civil unions (which I’ve always supported) would never lead to gay marriage.
With all that in mind, am I really supposed to buy that, within five years (maybe five days), the left and the media won’t be incessantly asking this question: “If the Church cannot legally refuse to marry an interracial couple, how can it legally refuse same-sex couples?” 
There are many good and well-intentioned people who believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. Much of the support from the right comes from our “live and let live” philosophy, which I share. But another liberty is on the line, and that is religious liberty. This push from the media has never been about allowing gay couples to marry; it’s about the left’s lifelong crusade to destroy the Church. 
The endgame is to declare the Bible and Christian beliefs de facto bigotry:
I have a right to defend myself. And to point out the hypocrisy of people who justify anti-gay bigotry by pointing to the Bible, and insisting we must live by the code of Leviticus on this one issue and no other. 
That is not some crackpot talking. That is Dan Savage, who has worked with no less than President Obama. And Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi… And the media loves him. 
Once this idea turns into anything close to mainstream with the left, the left’s legal harassment and outright harassment against the Church will be unceasing. (Muslims, of course, will never be bothered.)
Offering committed same-sex couples the same legal rights (and headaches) married couples enjoy is something I have supported for about twenty years. 
Civil unions are something I feel strongly enough about that, here in North Carolina, I did not vote in favor of making same-sex marriage unconstitutional last year. My concern was that the wording of the referendum would give lawmakers the power to ban civil unions. 
But I oppose same-sex marriage because marriage is a sacrament, and there is a big difference between asking one to be tolerant, and demanding one condone. 
Being gay is no more a sin than being straight. But just as straight people can engage in sinful behavior, so can gays. Asking me to condone anyone’s sinful behavior is asking too much. That is the complete opposite of bigotry, by the way — you know, applying the exact same standard to everyone. 
But when the State and its media attempt to force the Church to condone such a thing (and they will), what is unthinkable to many of the well-intentioned today will become a terrible reality. 
UPDATE: Erick Erickson at RedState:
Within a year or two we will see Christian schools attacked for refusing to admit students whose parents are gay. We will see churches suffer the loss of their tax exempt status for refusing to hold gay weddings. We will see private businesses shut down because they refuse to treat as legitimate that which perverts God’s own established plan. In some places this is already happening. …
The left cannot allow Christians to continue to preach the full gospel. We already see this in, of all places, Canada. Gay marriage is incompatible with a religion that preaches that the unrepentant are condemned, even of a sin the world has decided is not one. The religious freedom will eventually be ended through the judiciary. We should work to extend that freedom as long as we can.
Now many of you have read through this and you are shaking your head in denial. “No way this is possible,” you say. But then just a decade ago no one seriously considered gay marriage as possible. And we are already seeing signs we’re headed in this direction. It’s coming. Get ready.

I would trade quite a lot, in my life, for the unfathomable beauty of having national legislators who are not as dumb as burlap sacks of asbestos. Alas, however, it doesn't look like I'll ever see such a thing no matter what I were to wager, so let's check in on one of the nation's preeminent current sacks and see what they're up to.
In this case, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-TheMatterWithKansas) is the sack, and he's tossing himself in the muddy river of the Washington Times because, presumably, it was the dumbest outlet he could find, with an anti-marriage-equality argument that only counts as an ""argument"" if you like your arguments dull, jingoistic, ankle-shallow, devoid of facts, devoid of logic and generally devoid of anything that would ever suggest the writer was a sentient, breathing thing. As we've seen at the Supreme Court, however, that's all the ""argument"" we're going to get. The same arguments about God Says So, the same assertion that marriage is reserved for ""procreation only"" in spite of that never, ever seeming to come up when any of the other non-procreating people sign their names on the courthouse forms, and the same general sense that it is the bigots and the god-botherers and the people who feel icky when thinking about other people living their damn lives in peace that are the true victims in all this, because how can America survive if the biggest assholes among us do not hold holy sway over the rest?
All right, let's do this thing, or at least pieces of it. First off, the premise of the sack's argument is that ""motherhood"" is under attack. If there's any substantive argument to say so, hell if I can parse it out, but so sayeth the sack. That, and then some:
For conservatives, the concept of family is the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained, a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit recognized by the laws of nature, the laws of government, and civilized societies for thousands of years: one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption. In my case, that means me, Angela (my wife of 18 years), and our four children (who happen to be adopted).
Oh, dear God, it's going to be one of these. For the record, there is not a damn bit of that that is not puerile fluff. Let's break it up, below the fold:



For conservatives, the concept of family is (1) the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained, (2) a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit (3) recognized by the laws of nature, the (4) laws of government, and (5) civilized societies for thousands of years: (6) one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption.
(1) Says you. (2) Except the ""multiple wives"" ones. (3) There is no ""marriage"" at all in the ""laws of nature"", and you have no earthly clue what the ""laws of nature"" even might be, and ""family"" in nature is the result of anything from pair bonding to harems to gang rape to ritual murder to situational hermaphroditism to the male of the species biting the female upon which his body is slowly dissolved and absorbed into the female until only only the testicles are left, so shut up about what the supposed laws of nature say we should be doing to get ourselves in a family way and (4) see (2), and (5) see (2) and (4) and a whole mess of civilized societies who thought having a young boy on the side was the purest form of love there could be and (6) I'm just going to point out, yet a-freaking-gain, that the whole concept of ""marriage"" has been for nearly all of human history a question of property rights, and the spouse counted as a useful but not necessarily decisive portion of the property. I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered, pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph, and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenry at the damn least gets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.
If that happens, the high priests and priestesses of political correctness will have done irreparable harm to yet another pillar of the American paradigm for our patriotic, wholesome culture — “God, the flag, mom and apple pie.”
God damn it, here we have a person honestly using ""God, the flag, mom and apple pie"" as the pillars of ""the American paradigm,"" and they're not doing it ironically, neither the ""apple pie"" or the ""paradigm"" part. No, Tim here means it literally, and goes on to say that Bloomberg's soda ban and Michelle Obama's gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation's kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn't an April Fool's prank, this is a April Fool's way of life, preached about by an April Fool's mind, taken as a holy god damn April Fool's sacrament.
The Obama administration makes the incredible assertion that motherhood is superfluous to rebut an argument that the traditional two-parent family, led by both a mother and a father, provides the ideal situation to raise a child. In defiance of biology, nature and common sense, the administration argues that children need neither a father nor a mother and that having two fathers or two mothers or more is just as good as having one of each.
You are an idiot, and nobody's arguing anything about that, and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we're just going to explore this for one second, before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage, those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who, if we deny same-sex marriage, will say, ""Oh, rats, well, I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender, which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing."" No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man, one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.
Government, both federal and state, has a legitimate and defensible interest in ensuring that children conceived by a mother and father are, in fact, raised by their biological mothers and fathers whenever possible.
You, Tim Huelskamp, are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers, and yet you say yourself that you've adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role, and I can only assume it's because you, you bastard, adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.
I don't even want to go through all of Huelskamp's drivel; it's all just a collection of other people's most vapid thoughts, dumbed down, beaten up, then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument, such as it is, is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic, and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He's not even talking about ""gay Americans should not adopt children"", which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around, he's saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to ""motherhood"" and ""God"" and, sweet Jeebus, ""apple pie.""
This. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest, it is not thoughtful, it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted, dull-minded twerps who know they don't like same sex marriages being recognized, but can't rustle up so much as even the slightest actual, substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is, nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can't get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don't have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases, full stop, which itself is an implausible argument, you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father, or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version, and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments, this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don't have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.
This is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have, at long last, moved on, leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy, droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing, mustered for an argument that doesn't even make any internal sense, mustered because the only people left on the loser's side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense, and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks. I will be very, very glad when these people evolve that sense of shame. Anytime now, please.

Maryland state legislator Don Dwyer is a religious conservative who has called himself ""the face of the opposition"" to gay marriage, chastising fellow legislators to reject it because Jeebus and stuff. Most Americans, however, know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes, there were injuries, and yes, he's still facing charges).
In this new, miserably depressing story on Dwyer, he cites two things as the reasons for the ""increased"" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat, causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature, but more specifically, that time other legislators ""betrayed"" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:
Dwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston, Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage, an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill.
Kach, a Republican from Baltimore County, and Alston, a former Democrat from Prince George’s County, voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted.
Kach and Costa, of Deale, were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in  February.
“I had no time to do anything,” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier, I could have taken some action.”
It was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district, however, rejected it.
“That betrayal really affected me,” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.”
He said his drinking culminated in the crash.

So an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That's some powerful hatred, right there.
In the wake of the crash, Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might, instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to ""defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws,"" but he does admit he needs to rebuild ""trust"" with voters. I don't know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed, but I am not from Maryland, I am not a Republican voter, and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven, allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what it means to be an American religious conservative.

I'm not certain if anyone has noticed, but recently a new member has been invited into the ranks of 'hated minorities':  homophobic bigots!  According to the barrel of wacky wingnuts at the Family Research Council, Christians who believe that homosexuality is sinful -- and say as much -- are running scared from the flaming liberals intent on oppressing their every word.
Let's ignore the fact that the Family Research Council itself has been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Let's also skip past the nomenclature problems where a group that makes up 77% of America somehow magically becomes a minority.  Not to mention the fact that electing a non-Christian president would make a the election of the first black President look fairly easy by comparison (if ""not true! Kennedy was a Catholic!"" just popped into your mind, please get off the internet here. This is your stop).  Let's get straight into the FRC's argument and nip this nonsense in the bud.
Here's Peter Sprigg from the FRC talking toCNN:


We've heard of the ""down-low"" gay person who keeps his or her sexual identity secret for fear of public scorn. But Sprigg and other evangelicals say changing attitudes toward homosexuality have created a new victim: closeted Christians who believe the Bible condemns homosexuality but will not say so publicly for fear of being labeled a hateful bigot.
Oh boy!  So the breakdown as far as I can see is groups like the Family Research Council really want to have bigoted views and talk about them a lot -- in their case, in the context of advocating for actually damaging, actually discriminatory policy initiatives.  They just don't want to be called on it.  Fun fact:  You can believe whatever you want to believe and advocate for whatever social policies you see fit.  However, if those beliefs and social policies are hateful and bigoted, you may in fact be called a hateful bigot.  The Bible does not provide a mystic force field that protects you from criticism.  You'd think that biblical literalists would have a better understanding of cause and effect.  Unfortunately not.  But Sprigg continued:
“In the current culture, it takes more courage for someone like Chris Broussard to speak out than for someone like Jason Collins to come out,” says Sprigg, a former pastor. “The media will hail someone who comes out of the closet as gay, but someone who simply expresses their personal religious views about homosexual conduct is attacked.”
I've already written about Chris Broussard's views about Jason Collins at length. But suffice it to say, you can't pick which parts of the Bible you decide you want to follow.  For example, never saying one word about the morals of an entire sports league notorious for pre-marital and extra-marital sex, but once an athlete comes out as gay, feeling the need to pontificate on what does or doesn't make a ""true Christian.""  But I digress.  More importantly, the fact that anyone would think it's easier for Mr. Broussard to ""come out"" as a person who thinks homosexuality is wrong versus Mr. Collins' actually coming out is laughable.
There's a reason that it's taken so long for a man to step forward as the first openly gay athlete in one of the major sports.  There's also a reason why the person who stepped forward is nearing or at the end of his career.  Besides the media circus and having millions of strangers suddenly keenly interested in your intimate life, there are downsides like it's still perfectly legal to fire someone in most of the United States for simply being gay (further fun fact: the FRC is predictably adamant in its defense of those laws). And if that weren't enough, there's a real potential for violence.  According to the LA Times, hate crimes against LGBT people are on the rose by 13% from 2009-2010.  Among that group minorities were even more likely to be targeted.  2011 saw the highest number of anti-gay murders ever reported. Yes, yes, what courage Mr. Broussard had.  He should get a medal because by espousing bigoted claims, some think him an asshole.  If only he had it as easy as Jason Collins.
If I were a betting man, I would put $0.00 or less on the table for the possibility that facts, reason, logic or actual cudgels could be used effectively to beat any sense into the FRC or their mouth-breathing fanbase. Haters, as the saying goes, gonna hate. The most obnoxious part of this conversation to me is that a major media news outlet not owned by Rupert Murdoch -- CNN, ever the fucking baby-splitter -- is giving wide-eyed, credulous airtime to these ludicrous and offensive claims as if they are a meaningful part of an ongoing social conversation. There are a ton of interesting ways to cover the changing attitudes in America toward homosexuality and what that means for our past, present and future as a nation. But when the team representing the Obviously Wrong Side of History insists on having a little bitchfit about how they're the ones now being oppressed, this is not a reason for raising the alarm and slamming on the brakes for some soulful reflection on empirically idiotic claims. This is the time to play those people a very sad song on the world's tiniest little violin -- and let the rest of us dance into the future.

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan showed Wednesday that in 1996, the House passed the Defense of Marriage Act not to gently respect tradition but ""to express moral disapproval of homosexuality."" Paul Clement, the law's defender in court, tried to claim that's not so, but the more you look at the origins of DOMA, the more you realize that there is no way a law conceived so directly out of hatred can represent anything but hatred. DOMA didn't originate in the House, GLAAD reminds us. Rather, it came out of a coalition of hard-right groups like the Family Research Council, and from there to Congress. Current FRC head Tony Perkins explains:
Back in 1995, a group of individuals, including Don Wildmon, met in Memphis, Tennessee, because of what had happened in Hawaii where the court imposed same-sex marriage. Of course the folks there pushed back in the state of Hawaii. But then there was a concern that this could happen across the country. And so a group of leaders met in Memphis, Tennessee, and talked about the need to solidify marriage and by preventing states from imposing definition of marriage on the states. So the concept  of the Defense of Marriage Act—wasn't called that at the time—originated, and actually we took it back to our policy shop at FRC and formulated the policy and actually gave it the name Defense of Marriage Act.
The rollout of DOMA included Peter LaBarbera, who likes to talk about ""homo-fascism"" and has said ""We need to stop conceding the moral high ground in a fearful bid to appear 'tolerant,'"" and Robert Knight, who just this week wrote that ""the left’s drive for 'gay rights' poses the greatest domestic threat to the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly."" It included a C-SPAN-televised FRC briefing for Capitol Hill staff at which Knight claimed that:
If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or just believe that homosexuality is wrong, and the law gives homosexuality protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside civil law. The entire civil rights apparatus can be brought against you. Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal sanction; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital love.
At the same briefing, another ""expert"" argued that ""Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would support polygamy."" That same person argued, on another occasion, that the Supreme Court's Romer v. Evans decision that states can't ban anti-discrimination laws was a terrible, terrible thing because making it illegal to discriminate against gay people is in effect discriminating against bigots (or, as he put it, religious people).
This was the origination and the push for DOMA. There is no way to disguise it as anything but hate. And there is no way to seriously claim that in the not quite 17 years since the law's passage it has miraculously transmuted from hate to ... whatever Paul Clement is now claiming with his repeated invocations of the law as ""rational.""

So saith Adam Liptak in a news analysis piece in the New York Times today. As he writes, last June's decisions were very carefully calibrated:
The Supreme Court’s two decisions in June were finely balanced, with legal experts saying they had achieved the twin goals of advancing the cause of gay rights and avoiding a backlash in parts of the country not ready to embrace same-sex marriage.
But it hasn't worked. In June, 9 states and the District of Columbia embraced marriage equality; today, just six months later, the count is now 17, with challenges coming from Utah and Ohio.
How this has worked, with analysis from the pundits who thought this had been put to bed for a while, below the great orange wedding bouquet.


First, we have Professor Michael Dorf from Cornell Law School:
“If the court thought it was going to get a few years, I think they were naïve.”
Dorf, of course, thinks that the lower court and the 10th Circuit should have issued a stay. Now that several hundred couples have been married in Utah, that seems more moot than the several hundred couples San Francisco married in 2004.
Professor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby’s ruling. “On the strictly legal argument,” he said, “it’s hard to justify granting a stay.”
But he added that the lower courts should have done so, partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict.
“It’s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,” Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “If their hand is forced, as it now will be, it’s impossible to say with certainty what they’ll do.”

""Would rather."" What a pity they're being rushed. Liptak doesn't see this as an issue for this term, but sees it for the session that begins in October 2015 (which is what I've been saying)  by which time that will be several thousand couples in Utah, not several hundred, and several hundred, no doubt, in Idaho and Colorado and Wyoming because Utah is closer than, say, New Mexico or Iowa.
And, yes, Liptak points out that the Utah decision was based on a sentence in Scalia's dissent on the Windsor case
“The view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today’s opinion”
as GrafZeppelin127 and Kalil pointed out here when the decision was published, a gesture, that, as Liptak reports,
did not impress Jason Mazzone, a law professor at the University of Illinois. “His opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger,” Professor Mazzone wrote in a blog post last Friday.
Well, okay!
But Michael Klarman, a historian at Harvard Law School, now thinks two to six years, even with the current composition of the court. He doesn't think it's open-ended any more.
So, Utah has set the wheels in motion for the endgame. Illinois, Oregon and New Jersey are in the pipeline now. Historically, this is a QUICK process, as we remember that Prop 8 was only five years ago. Of course, the Supreme Court COULD have done this sooner by accepting the Ninth Circuit's decision on Prop 8, a decision that is now lost to them, but I think I can wait a couple of years.
Now, our task is to change the composition of the House so we can get ENDA passed and signed.

If anyone wants to argue that the same government currently forcing religious institutions to purchase the abortion pill through ObamaCare will not eventually use civil rights violations in order to attempt to force the Church to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies — good luck with that.  
But this would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
It was just three months ago that the White House and media piled on a reverend for preaching the Bible’s teachings on homosexuality. The result was his invitation to speak at Obama’s inauguration being rescinded. 
This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
With the election of Pope Francis, we have news anchors openly clamoring that the Church is out of step on same-sex marriage.
This would have been unthinkable five years ago. 
Fifteen years ago, the same leftists and media assuring us today that same-sex marriage won’t be imposed on the Church were telling us that civil unions (which I’ve always supported) would never lead to gay marriage.
With all that in mind, am I really supposed to buy that, within five years (maybe five days), the left and the media won’t be incessantly asking this question: “If the Church cannot legally refuse to marry an interracial couple, how can it legally refuse same-sex couples?” 
There are many good and well-intentioned people who believe same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. Much of the support from the right comes from our “live and let live” philosophy, which I share. But another liberty is on the line, and that is religious liberty. This push from the media has never been about allowing gay couples to marry; it’s about the left’s lifelong crusade to destroy the Church. 
The endgame is to declare the Bible and Christian beliefs de facto bigotry:
I have a right to defend myself. And to point out the hypocrisy of people who justify anti-gay bigotry by pointing to the Bible, and insisting we must live by the code of Leviticus on this one issue and no other. 
That is not some crackpot talking. That is Dan Savage, who has worked with no less than President Obama. And Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi… And the media loves him. 
Once this idea turns into anything close to mainstream with the left, the left’s legal harassment and outright harassment against the Church will be unceasing. (Muslims, of course, will never be bothered.)
Offering committed same-sex couples the same legal rights (and headaches) married couples enjoy is something I have supported for about twenty years. 
Civil unions are something I feel strongly enough about that, here in North Carolina, I did not vote in favor of making same-sex marriage unconstitutional last year. My concern was that the wording of the referendum would give lawmakers the power to ban civil unions. 
But I oppose same-sex marriage because marriage is a sacrament, and there is a big difference between asking one to be tolerant, and demanding one condone. 
Being gay is no more a sin than being straight. But just as straight people can engage in sinful behavior, so can gays. Asking me to condone anyone’s sinful behavior is asking too much. That is the complete opposite of bigotry, by the way — you know, applying the exact same standard to everyone. 
But when the State and its media attempt to force the Church to condone such a thing (and they will), what is unthinkable to many of the well-intentioned today will become a terrible reality. 
UPDATE: Erick Erickson at RedState:
Within a year or two we will see Christian schools attacked for refusing to admit students whose parents are gay. We will see churches suffer the loss of their tax exempt status for refusing to hold gay weddings. We will see private businesses shut down because they refuse to treat as legitimate that which perverts God’s own established plan. In some places this is already happening. …
The left cannot allow Christians to continue to preach the full gospel. We already see this in, of all places, Canada. Gay marriage is incompatible with a religion that preaches that the unrepentant are condemned, even of a sin the world has decided is not one. The religious freedom will eventually be ended through the judiciary. We should work to extend that freedom as long as we can.
Now many of you have read through this and you are shaking your head in denial. “No way this is possible,” you say. But then just a decade ago no one seriously considered gay marriage as possible. And we are already seeing signs we’re headed in this direction. It’s coming. Get ready.

When NBC News granted Al Sharpton the honor of having a prime time news show on their cable outlet, MSNBC, they lauded his role as an “elder statesman” of the Democratic Party. They named the show “Politics Nation” and positioned the nightly broadcast as a left-leaning political show focusing on national politics as a natural lead-in to “Hardball.”  It was a well-orchestrated PR strategy to distance Sharpton from his controversial and odious past as a race-baiting advocate for proven liars Tawana Brawley and the antagonist in the Duke Lacrosse case. 
The message was clear: Sharpton isn’t the charlatan race-baiter you’ve grown to loathe; he’s now a power player in the Democratic Party and is here to bring his unique, seasoned perspective to the national political conversation. 
Oh what a difference a year makes. 
These days, Politics Nation has turned into the Trayvon Martin Show as Sharpton goes right back to his roots as a sensationalist willing to advocate for any victim of a crime as long as they are the right race and the alleged perpetrator is white (or “white hispanic” in this case). 
Friday night Sharpton had Trayvon Martin’s family attorney on to discuss the George Zimmerman trial scheduled to begin in 10 days. Understand that Martin’s attorney, Benjamin Crump, has no actual standing in this case as it is the state of Florida against Zimmerman in these criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, Sharpton allowed Crump to lay out the state’s case against Zimmerman with Sharpton cheering and participating in the multi-media opening and closing arguments. By the time the segment was done, Zimmerman was all but tried and convicted with the most inflammatory and defamatory language possible: 
Crump:  When you really think about it in the totality of circumstances, George Zimmerman as this neighborhood watch patrol volunteer going around the neighborhood with a gun on prescription medication is every parent’s worse nightmare, because God help you if he comes up to your teenage child and says ‘what are you doing around here’ and your teenager doesn’t answer the question right. Then you have a Trayvon Martin situation at your doorstep. And we can’t have that in a law-abiding society.
Hearing that un-refuted and damning narration, no jury in the world would move to acquit Zimmerman. And that’s the point. Sharpton is using his NBC News platform to set the Zimmerman case up as an open and shut case of 2nd degree murder, and if anything short of a conviction comes from the Florida jury, well, you know the reason why. 
At that point, if Zimmerman is acquitted, get ready for Politics Nation to then be used to advocate for social justice and political unrest until there is “justice for Trayvon.” 
NBC News might as well replace Sharpton’s microphone with a bullhorn now.

403,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/19/1180131/-Today-in-GunFail-News,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,Today in GunFail News,"


I've been tweeting up a storm with all the various flavors of gun fail. And there are a lot. But as interesting as the stories are, they don't do us any good if we don't collect them in some more permanent way. So here's my first attempt at doing so. But to avoid going completely crazy, I'm limiting myself (with a few notable exceptions), to incidents from January 2013 only. Where possible, I've tagged each incident with the date on which the actual shooting took place, according to the linked stories.
Before we even get started, what is this all about? Does it mean you can't or shouldn't have guns? No, not by itself. But what it does mean is that people who start out with the best of intentions sometimes get themselves mixed up in some serious trouble, and often people die because of it. These are the stories you should think about every time you handle a weapon, or are near someone else who's handling one.
And yes, these stories have special relevance now that more and more people are carrying concealed weapons, often with the idea in mind that they're protecting both themselves and the community. It's also relevant to the question of whether or not we should be putting guns in our schools. Whether you're trained or not, experienced or not, or were raised around guns or not, where guns go, accidents follow. That's just statistics. You can do your best to prevent accidents, but everyone thinks they're a responsible gun owner, until something happens. Sometimes because you were kidding yourself. And sometimes although you think you did everything right.
But the mistakes are very often of the kind that cannot be taken back.
Before we begin with January's stories, here's some follow-up news on some prominent cases that actually happened in December:

12/08/12: No charges filed in accidental shooting of 7-year-old boy. On a trip with dad to the gun shop. Shot and killed in his safety seat in dad's truck, when the pistol everyone thought was unloaded inexplicably fired all by itself while sitting on the center console.
12/10/12: This one could've been prevented with a simple, ""Who's there? I have a gun!"" Which would have been answered with, ""Don't shoot, Grandpa! It's me!"" But instead, he shot first. Because he's a fucking ninja. Well, actually, he's the pastor of the local Seventh Day Adventist church. But whatevs.
12/28/12: Involuntary manslaughter charges, though, for the uncle who killed his 12-year-old nephew in a hunting accident. Seems the uncle didn't bother obtaining a hunting license, and skipped the mandatory hunting safety course. Wonder why they have those? Probably tyranny.

Now, new incidents from this month, beginning with the traditional woundings and deaths caused by New Year's celebratory gunfire:

1/01/13: Houston Co. man injured by celebratory New Year's gunshot
1/01/13: 67-year-old Laurie Eileen Eberhardt was sitting on a patio at the St. Pete Yacht Club watching the fireworks when a bullet struck her hand at about 12:08 AM
1/01/13: Police say celebratory gunfire a growing problem in Jacksonville after 8-year-old boy is shot in foot on New Year's Eve
1/01/13: 10-yo girl killed by celebratory gunfire to mark the New Year.

January's hunting accidents. I don't always tweet about these, because as tragic as they are, hunters know they can be shot. So many others of these accidents happen to people who really think things won't happen to them, and that puts them in a different category:

1/01/13: Duck Hunter killed in accidental shooting laid to rest
1/01/13: I'm not really sure if that's a deer, but I do have this .50-caliber muzzleloading rifle, so I guess there's one way to find out. Hmm. Nope. Not a deer. It's a dead guy with a .50-cal. sized hole in him. Weird, because I have a .50-cal. Oh, also, it's my dad.
1/03/13: By ""unimaginable coincidence,"" his friend happened to be driving by the deer’s passage at the same time
1/03/13: The teen was accidentally shot by his father while deer hunting in Waller County.
1/10/13: Authorities say the victim apparently walked into the aim of his friend and was struck by birdshot from a shotgun.
1/12/13: A juvenile was shot in the back Saturday evening while hunting.
1/12/13: A 13-year-old Tuscaloosa boy was killed Saturday in a hunting accident.
1/12/13: State police say a man escaped serious injury when he was accidentally shot while hunting in central New Jersey.
1/13/13: Hudson Barber, the 12-year-old son of Bobby and Allison Barber of Bainbridge, is recovering after seriously injuring his right leg in a hunting accident this past weekend. The accident happened on Sunday, Jan. 13, near Faceville. It was an accidental, self-inflicted shotgun wound, Hudson’s father said.
1/15/13: ""One of the main things they teach is wear hunter orange, be organized on your hunts, and look before you shoot,"" said Sheriff Darby.
1/19/13: Father shoots son in the face while deer hunting

General Idiocy / ""I didn't know it was loaded!""

When Democrat Gov. John Hickenlooper signed expanded background checks and a “high capacity” magazine ban into law on March 20, the lesson for other states was that this is what you get if you give Democrats the reins of power.
Colorado is a gun state, always has been. But Under Hickenlooper and the Democrat-controlled state legislature, Colorado’s immediate future is one of ever expanding gun control. 
How pro-gun was Colorado before Democrats rolled into town? Think about it this way–in Colorado there are no special permits required to buy a handgun, a shotgun, or a rifle. They have concealed carry laws within their state which even recognize the right to carry firearms on college and university campuses for self-defense.
Moreover, Colorado used to have open carry within the state–which means anyone over 21, with no felonies, used to be able to strap their revolver or pistol on their hip and go about their day with their firearm in plain view. I lived in Colorado in the 1990’s, and not only remember carrying a gun in this manner but also seeing many others carry one as well.
However, by the late 1990’s, the Democrats’ influence was beginning to take hold, and people were being discouraged from carrying guns thus. Now, the laws regarding open carry are best described as “vague,” and I would not risk carrying in the open if I were in the state. 
Add to this Gov. Hickenlooper’s ban on “high capacity” magazines and the ban on private gun sales, which is part and parcel to the expanded background checks, and it’s easy to see how far Colorado gun laws have fallen. 
Here’s the lesson for other states: Democrats cannot be trusted with your guns–period. And given time and power, they will turn any gun state into a gun control state. "

In today's Washington Post, Susan Eisenhower, the granddaughter of President Eisenhower, weighs in on something only a handful of Americans have ever experienced:  what it is like growing up in public as a child under the care of armed security.    
Like any decent person, I was offended and appalled by the latest vicious attack by the NRA, targeting Malia and Sasha.    But my outrage pales in comparison to anything Eisenhower must feel.  Most telling is her closing paragraph:
Even a longtime Washingtonian such as I thought these ads couldn’t get worse. So I have a question for the NRA and others who use such tactics: Have you no sense of decency, sirs?
Those who remember their American history recognize that question and know why she asks it now.



For those who don't recognize the question, it was the question Joseph Welch asked Joe McCarthy during the famous McCarthy-Army hearings.  That moment marked a turning point in American history.  It happened during the Eisenhower administration, when Susan would have been too young to appreciate its import.
But I think her choice of this question signals her belief that we are, once again, at a turning point when America will recoil in disgust having seen the true face of the threat to our liberty.
The McCarthy-Army hearings were notable for the fact they were the first hearings aired on TV.  They had been going on for some time and could be followed on radio.  But McCarthy's venality was not as obvious without the video.  To give you an idea of how much of an impact these hearings had on popular culture, TV sales skyrocketed as people bought them to watch the hearings -- which dominated TV coverage for months.
The fact the NRA would target children shows how far out of bounds they are.  Like McCarthy before them, they betray their wanton disregard for common decency.  Hopefully, their fate will be that of McCarthy -- dying alone, forgotten, disgraced, and humiliated.
During the 2008 campaign, like many others, I harbored a dread for Obama's safety.  It took me a long time to write about that, the pain of 40 year-old wounds ran deep.  As I consider the depravity of the NRA's attack on the Obama children, I am shocked to realize how twisted these bastards are.  As dark as the '60s were, no one ever seriously thought the Kennedy children were targets.  
Searching my memory, I have a hard time finding a moment in history that could even come close to the nightmare these animals call forth with their dog-whistle.  Unfortunately, I can think of such a time.  The 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in 1963.    Remembering that event, it no longer shocks me that the NRA would conjure up that image.   I would sooner be shocked that a rabid dog bit a child.   At this point, there is only one thing left to do.  We have to put them out of their misery, for our own protection:

Haley Barbour at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011, where he might not be so welcome this year.



Haley Barbour at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011, where he might not be so welcome this year.

While Karl Rove is off doing battle against the tea party, Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour (a top figure in his party) has opened a new front in the GOP Civil War.
Last week, at a closed-door retreat in northern Virginia, Barbour told a large gathering of congressional staffers, including several leadership aides, that party officials should discourage donors from funding the high-profile conservative group [...]
Many in the audience applauded Barbour for his remarks, according to two sources in the room.

Mainstream Republicans should be upset at the Club for Growth's self-destructive tendencies. They had their heyday in the 2010 GOP wave by backing conservative insurgents like Sens. Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio, (former CfG prez) Pat Toomey, and Rand Paul. On the other hand, they help cost the GOP the Senate by helping Sharron Angle and Ken Buck defeat more electable candidates in their primaries.
In 2012, they were one of the earliest backers of Richard Mourdock's primary challenge in Indiana, an effort that cost Republicans the seat in the general. On the other hand, they backed the more electable candidate in Arizona's Senate race (Jeff Flake, who ended up winning in the general), and were a major factor in Ted Cruz's primary victory in Texas. Cruz, of course, is now auditioning for the role of ""2013's Allen West"" to great conservative acclaim.
Compared to Karl Rove's track record, the Club has been a success!
But ""success"" and ""elections"" are all relative terms when it comes to the GOP, a party that has now lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, lost seats in a year where the map was theirs for the taking, and lost the popular vote in the House, holding it by virtue of their own aggressive gerrymandering.
This is a party getting blown out of the water by the nation's fastest-growing demographics—Asians, Latinos, and millennials, not to mention women, the largest single voting block. They are a party that claims to ""reinvent"" itself in weekly confabs, only to find itself trapped in a political Groundhog Day.
Barbour is right when he says, ""Politics can’t be about purity. Unity wins in politics, purity loses."" Problem is, they created a monster designed solely to instill such purity, and they can't put that genie back in the bottle. This isn't like the old days, when the John Birchers were kept outside the GOP tent. These days, the crazies run the joint.

408,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/19/1180414/-The-Importance-of-Gun-Control,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,The Importance of Gun Control,"











     No democratic legislation int his country has ever called for a ban on all guns; rather we call for gun CONTROL. We need tighter gun control in this country and the reasons should be obvious. How many innocent children have to die before the access to deadly weapons becomes more difficult? I hope the recent tragedies in Aurora, Colorado and Newtown, CT bring to light the importance of gun control reform. Gun control is not a threat to our freedom, and it can save thousands of lives. This is my opinion piece that I couple with my research article ""Guns In America"".



     More people die from gun shots in the United States than any other country in the civilized world, we also have more gun-related crimes, over all, than any other country in the world. According to the statistics from the FBI, 6,009 people were murdered with handguns in America in 2010, which was 67.5% of all murders in the country that year. There were 8,775 total firearm crimes reported in the U.S. in 2010. The highest rates of gun crimes in the Unites States come primarily from states where gun laws are most lenient. South Carolina and Tennessee dominate the board in their rate of gun crimes per capita.
      Our constitutional rights are very much valid and important, but no right is absolute, without exception or consideration for particular circumstances. Even the sacred right to freedom of speech is limited in that you cannot knowingly spread false information (although no one is telling that to Fox News), you cannot call in a fake bomb threat and incite terror, and you cannot threaten someone’s life or purposefully insight violent actions. The second amendment right to gun ownership is equally as relative.
      When the Second Amendment was ratified, the founding fathers had very little or no understanding of mental health and stability. Medicine and medical knowledge was still very primitive at the time and psychology was not a known practice or science until late into the 19th century. So the founding fathers never gave a thought to those who were mentally unstable and should not own guns, nor to young boys with guns who were treated like men from a very early age. Guns at the time were also far less dangerous than they are today, their guns shot one weak bullet at a time and it took a long time to reload. There were no weapons of mass destruction, no bombs, no silencers, and no automatic rifles, and there was no way for the first congress to anticipate the future of weapons technology.
      Children who are not even old enough to vote or drive have access to deadly weapons. If a nine year old were allowed behind the wheel of a car, even with an adult, it would be a crime and the parent would be charged for negligence and child endangerment, at least. Yet I have seen and heard of children as young as four and five who are taken to shooting ranges and taught to shoot. This practice, even with older children, desensitizes them of the dangers of guns. Children’s brains are NOT developed enough to handle the dangers and responsibilities of handling a gun. They are not mature enough to comprehend the severity of the potential consequences. The human frontal lobe, which is the home of consequential thinking, rationalizing, and decision making, is not fully developed until the age of about twenty-five. Children are also not physically coordinated enough to safely handle a gun, which is why we also don’t let young children play with sharp things, boiling water, and fire!
      I am an advocate for the restriction of guns from everyone under the age of twenty-one. I believe that if you pass a written safety test you should be able to acquire a firearm learner’s license when you’re eighteen.  With the learner’s license you may go to approved shooting ranges, be issued a gun, and practice shooting targets under strict supervision. Once you turn twenty-one you should then be able to have a psychiatric evaluation, a written safety test, and a shooting range test. If you pass the tests, you can get a license to buy and own certain hand guns and rifles for self-defense. We are required to be tested in multiple ways to get a license to drive; it is only logical that it should be at least as difficult to attain a license to own a deadly weapon. Cars are also registered, and no one questions it, and it is far more important that guns be registered so that crimes are easily traced back to the offender. It should also be a law that all firearms must be locked away securely and unloaded when not in use.
      Assault weapons and automatics should be strictly prohibited. I am viciously against hunting, but even if you are pro-hunting there is no reason for anyone to have automatic assault weapons. Automatic weapons are meant to kill people in an attack. They are not used in hunting, are impractical for self-defense, and no civilian has any business with such dangerous weapons. In an ideal world such weapons would not even exist, but as long as they do they must be kept from those unqualified to use them.
      For those that would argue that they fear of a massive military uprising against the American people, you are exactly the type of paranoid nut that I do not want handling guns. The fact is that most of the people in our military would not turn on the American people (their own people) even if they were ordered to. Also, if the far-fetched, unlikely scenario occurred wherein the government and military utterly, blatantly, and violently turned on us and made this country a military state at gunpoint, we are not going to be saved by a crowd of civilians with a few assault weapons. The fact is that the American people have already been taken over, but it has been done in subtler ways, through economic disparities and corporate control of our government.
     The reason that our weak gun control laws go utterly unchallenged is that the NRA, weapons manufacturers, and rich Christian institutions have strict monetary ties with the political “right”. The NRA supplies the right-wing with a mountain of campaign contributions and, in return, the politicians vote for and pass legislation that “protects the second amendment”, and keeps gun restrictions weak. The NRA and the GOP also fool the general public by asserting that the Democrats and liberals want to “take away your guns”, and ban guns entirely. They also feed into baseless conspiracy theories about “socialist” military take overs. The second amendment is a Republican talking point used to distract the masses and gain followers who don’t understand that the right-wing’s true agenda is to take over the people by sucking our way of life dry and turning us into ignorant, desperate subjects and sheep.

NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam responded to the outrage over their despicable ad bemoaning President Obama's children receiving Secret Service protection while your children get nothing.
Whoever thinks the ad is about President Obama's daughters are missing the point completely or they're trying to change the subject. This ad is about keeping our children safe. And the President said he was skeptical about the NRA proposal to put policemen in all schools in this country. Yet he and his family are beneficiaries of multiple law enforcement officers surrounding them 24 hours a day.
That's the real issue. Anything else is an attempted calculated distraction.


Are the president’s kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he’s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security.
Right. That had absolutely nothing to do with the President's children, nor was it a personal attack on President Obama. We are just taking the ad out of context and using it as a distraction for our own ends.
These people are about as craven as they come. Good luck convincing anyone that criticism of this reprehensible message is a distraction.
Not even Joe Scarborough is buying it.
From the link at Media Matters:
Scarborough, who as a Congressman was a strong supporter of the NRA, responded to the ad, asking ""what's wrong with these people?"" He continued, pointing out that once Obama decided to run for president, his children ""have targets on their backs."" Scarborough also said that the NRA is now a ""fringe organization with millions of mainstream members."" He concluded by saying the ad was ""frightening and over the line"".
When the NRA loses someone as wingnutty as Joe Scarborough, you know they are backed into a corner. And now that we have them backed into a corner, it's time to push them back under that rock they crawled out from under.

It hasn’t always been the case that only MPs can carry firearms on U.S. military bases. A mere twenty years ago, “gun free zones” made their way to these facilities under the watch of President Bill Clinton. 
According to a Washington Times editorial written days after the Nov. 5, 2009 attack on soldiers at Fort Hood, one of Clinton’s “first acts upon taking office… was to disarm U.S. soldiers on military bases.”
Clinton’s actions birthed Army regulations “forbidding military personnel from carrying their personal firearms and making it almost impossible for commanders to issue firearms to soldiers in the U.S. for personal protection.” 
In other words, thanks to Clinton, citizens who join the military to use guns to defend liberty abroad cannot practice their constitutional right to keep and bear arms while on active duty at home. 
As the Times editorial board put it: “Because of Mr. Clinton, terrorists would face more return fire if they attacked a Texas Wal-Mart than the gunman faced at Fort Hood.”
The same theme ran true at the Navy Yard in DC on September 16. Police were called after the shooter opened fired, and reports indicate it took approximately three to seven minutes for them to arrive. Each minute is an eternity when a lunatic with a weapon decides the “gun free zone” rules do not apply to him.

411,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/03/09/Sheriffs-and-Guns,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Sheriffs and the Second Amendment,"

“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”
Those twenty-seven words enshrined in the Constitution by our founding fathers clearly give us the right to own firearms in the protection of God-given liberty.
Most Americans agree with the right to bear arms. According to a recent Rasmussen survey, 65% of Americans see gun rights as “a protection against tyranny.” Among those 65% are thousands of uniformed local and state police officers who see real criminals on a daily basis who not only have not properly registered their firearms or submitted to a background check; regardless of what liberals and the Obama Administration try to jam through Congress, they’re not going to succeed. 
As the Supreme Court affirmed in the 1997 case Printz v. United States, county sheriffs are the chief law-enforcement officers in their jurisdictions, with more authority than even federal agents. As such, sheriffs work for their constituents and must comply with their oath to defend both the United States and state constitutions, not do the bidding of out-of-control politicians in Washington who apparently recognize no limits on their power. 
So elected leaders, such as Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, Jackson County, Kentucky Sheriff Denny Peyman, Milwaukee County Sherriff David Clarke Jr., and others are speaking out against Obama’s campaign against gun ownership. Almost 300 sheriffs from across the country and at least 13 state sheriff organizations have announced their opposition to President Obama’s proposed gun control measures, pledging to defend the Second Amendment within their jurisdiction. That number is increasing on a daily basis.
While some liberal legal scholars find ambiguity in the unusual wording of the 2nd Amendment, most state constitutions are very explicit in allowing citizens to own guns. For example, the Ohio Constitution states “The people have the right to bear arms for their defense and security[…],” while Delaware’s Constitution goes further: “A person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense of self, family, home and State, and for hunting and recreational use.”
However, with the Executive Branch under control of Barack Obama, and too many liberal Democrats in Congress, our Constitutionally-protected rights are under attack
Using the senseless carnage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut as a vehicle (remember Rahm Emanuel’s comment that you should never let a crisis go to waste?), gun control advocates have shamelessly stood upon the graves of innocent children to promote their misguided political agenda. President Obama has already taken immediate steps to limit legal gun usage through constitutionally questionable executive orders; he promised more limitations during his recent State of the Union Address.
In Congress, the anti-gun efforts are lead by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who recently announced proposed legislation that would ban 157 makes and models of military-style “assault” rifles, pistols, shotguns, and semi-automatic weapons. In addition, she proposes to outlaw fixed ammunition clips that can hold more than 10 rounds and ban civilian variations of military combat model firearms.
Feinstein was the author of the 1994 assault weapons ban (which expired in 2004) and had access to plenty of data which suggests crime rates did not drop during the ban. Murder and violent crime rates never went above what they were in the year prior to the ban sunsetting. Most policemen will gladly tell you that criminals almost always use handguns.
Our rights are in jeopardy. Police officers, while they serve our communities proudly, cannot be everywhere at once, and law-abiding citizens must have the ability to protect their families before help arrives. It is time to support our police officers by standing up to President Obama’s anti-gun agenda."

This is what happens when you let this guy actually do stuff.



This is what happens when you let this guy actually do stuff.

Last week, the Office of Personnel Management (sort of the HR department for the federal government) released its fix for the glitch in which congressional staff were in danger of losing their the employer contribution part of their health insurance. That would have meant that some staff couldn't afford to be insured at all. Under the fix, staffers will still purchase health insurance on the exchange, and will keep the employer subsidy (but not get the tax credit, or Obamacare subsidy).
Immediately, the Right screeched that Congress made itself exempt. FreedomWorks pretends like staff keeping their subsidies is an entirely new thing and that this is congress exempting itself from the law. Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) called it an ""outrageous exemption for Congress.""
As Jonathon Cohn points out, yes congressional employees are treated differently under the law. But it's because Congress adopted an amendment from Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to make it so. Grassley thought he was being cute and putting Democrats in a bind when he suggested that Congress be put into the exchanges. Democrats thought, why the hell not, but in accepting the Grassley amendment, didn't get all the kinks worked out because Congress was the only large employer that already provided benefits being forced onto the exchange.
Making sure employees retained their employer contribution would have been an easy legislative fix, but Republicans aren't going to allow any fix to Obamacare, even one that benefits their staff. So OPM made the decision, giving the GOP yet another opportunity to screech about the law. But this time, they're screeching about their own provision. It gets more surreal every day.

413,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/30/Obama-Discards-You-Can-Keep-Your-Plan-Promise,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Obama Cancels 'You Can Keep Your Plan' Promise: 'Just Shop Around',"
In a speech at Boston’s Faneuil Hall on Wednesday afternoon, President Barack Obama discarded his now-infamous broken promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep your health insurance.” Instead, he offered a new promise: “You will be getting a better deal,” the president told health insurance consumers. 
He blamed insurance companies, not Obamacare, for the canceled policies:
Now, if you had one of these substandard plans before the Affordable Care Act became law, and you really like that plan, you were able to keep it. That’s what I said when I was running for office. That was part of the promise we made. But ever since the law was passed, if insurers decided to downgrade or cancel the substandard plans, what we said under the law is that you have got to replace them with quality, comprehensive coverage because that, too, was a central premise of the Affordable Care Act from the very beginning…
So if you’re getting one of these letters [canceling your insurance policy], just shop around in the new marketplace. That’s what it’s for…
For the fewer than 5% of Americans who buy insurance on your own, you will be getting a better deal. So anyone peddling the motion that insurers are canceling people’s plan without mentioning that almost all the insurers are encouraging people to join better plans with the same carrier and stronger benefits and stronger protections, while others will be able to get better plans with new carriers through the marketplace, and then many will get new help to pay for these better plans and make them actually cheaper–if you leave that stuff out, you’re being grossly misleading, to say the least.
Ignoring evidence that the “better deal” is often far more expensive than existing plans, the president updated his promise without apologizing for misleading voters for years about the consequences of Obamacare. He also ignored the fact that companies were compelled by the law to change their plans to comply with new rules.
Obama, repeating a common Democrat talking point, also cited Medicare Part D to claim that Democrats had helped Republicans improve that policy, even though they had opposed it. However, as Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) pointed out in Congress earlier Wednesday, Medicare Part D is voluntary–unlike Obamacare."
414,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/14/1262769/-Furious-conservatives-forget-Bush-ordered-insurers-to-pay-for-Medicare-prescriptions,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,Furious conservatives forget Bush ordered insurers to pay for Medicare prescriptions,"


With the deadlines looming for Americans to enroll in health insurance plans for 2014, conservatives are shocked--shocked!--that the Obama administration is ""strongly urging"" insurance companies to start coverage on January 1 even in advance of receiving new subscribers' premium payments. For the Wall Street Journal and Forbes' Avik Roy, these and other HHS contingency measures designed to help consumers manage the transition to new policies during the rocky rollout of the health insurance exchanges mean ""backdating Obamacare,"" a ""government takeover"" which treats carriers like ""battered wives.""
But the frothing at the mouth conservatives would be advised to swallow their bile. After all, when the disastrous launch of the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program left over six million seniors without their drug coverage in January 2006, President Bush ordered America's insurance companies to pay for their prescriptions while the fiasco was straightened out. And as it turned, dozens of states--most of them led by Democratic governors--had to step in cover billions more in drug costs until the Bush HHS could fix the system that left patients, pharmacists and physicians alike frustrated and confused.
As the New York Times reported on January 16, 2006 (""President Tells Insurers to Aid Ailing Medicare Drug Plan""):
With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug.
The actions came after several states declared public health emergencies, and many states announced that they would step in to pay for prescriptions that should have been covered by the federal Medicare program.
Republicans have joined Democrats in asserting that the federal government botched the beginning of the prescription drug program, which started on Jan. 1. People who had signed up for coverage found that they were not on the government's list of subscribers. Insurers said they had no way to identify poor people entitled to extra help with their drug costs. Pharmacists spent hours on the telephone trying to reach insurance companies that administer the drug benefit under contract to Medicare.
Many of the problems involve low-income people entitled to both Medicare and Medicaid.
In a directive sent to all Medicare drug plans over the weekend, the Bush administration said they ""must take immediate steps"" to ensure that low-income beneficiaries were not charged more than $2 for a generic drug and $5 for a brand-name drug.
In addition, it said insurers must cover a 30-day emergency supply of drugs that beneficiaries were taking prior to the start of the new program.
In an interview yesterday, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said that ""several hundred thousand beneficiaries who switched plans"" in December may have had difficulty filling prescriptions in the last two weeks.

The Bush administration's desperation and insistence, as Roy would put it, that ""insurers to cover up for its mistakes"" was understandable. As the Washington Post reported on January 14, 2006, ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. Two days later, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue:



About 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program.
Among the governors taking action were future Obamacare foes Tim Pawlenty and Mike Huckabee, who declared a health emergency in his state of Arkansas. Joining them was Texas Governor Rick Perry, who on January 26 ordered the Lone Star State's Health and Human Services Commission to resume state Medicaid coverage for residents who were switched to the Medicare plan and are having problems with the new system.
But as we fast forward to December 2013, the reliable water carriers of the Republican Party are outraged that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under Democrat Barack Obama are following the same course. As Avik Roy put it:
The administration could pay insurers to cover up for its mistakes. But that would lead to criticism--as it has in other instances--that the White House is lawlessly throwing taxpayer money at insurers to, well, cover up for its mistakes. So, instead, they're asking insurers to pay for the mistakes.
For their part, the insurers seem largely unfazed by the Obama administration's request. As the Washington Post's Sarah Kliff reported:
One insurance official, who asked for anonymity to discuss the proposal frankly, said the changes did look generally feasible at first glance.
They should be feasible for the insurers. After all, they did the same thing for President Bush.

Last night, Jon Stewart cut through the spin and looked at the real reason Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) are threatening to shut down the government if Obamacare isn't defunded.
So repeal, defund, information blackout, misinform, appeal to fear of anal puppet finger-banging.  What if none of these constructive solutions to improve Obamacare work?
DR. SANJAY GUPTA (9/22/2013): Some Republicans in Congress are threatening to shut down the government unless the president agrees to strip out funding for Obamacare.
Threatening?  Threatening to shut down the government?  To Republicans, that's not a threat, that's the goal!  Wasn't that one of the themes at last year's Republican Convention?

Yeah, that's right!  I remember that night.  How....?  (audience laughter)  Filthy.  How do you....?  I'll let you read it at your own pace.  (audience laughter)  As it rolls around the room, some people are just getting to that.
How do you justify a government shutdown?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/23/2013): I believe nothing is hurting the American people more, nothing is hurting the economy more, nothing is damaging jobs more, than Obamacare.
Nothing makes food taste worse!  Nothing makes it harder to get an erection!  Nothing spoils Breaking Bad!  Nothing sews you into a human centipede like Obamacare!!  Obamacare will murder your hope!
Still, if Ted Cruz's problem with Obamacare is that it's hurting jobs, I'm curious, what would a government shutdown do?
CHRISTINE ROMANS (9/23/2013): Based on the last shutdown in 1995 ... Hundreds of thousands of federal workers sent home without pay.  Many, if not most, federal offices and programs would be closed, shut down.  During the last shutdown, 200,000 passport applications went unprocessed.  Some services to veterans were suspended.
President Obama will be forced to get around on Air Force 3.

The Washington Monument's fluffer will be furloughed.

(audience laughter)
Why is that... we couldn't have pointed that in the other direction?  (more audience laughter)  For God's sakes.  All right, move on, move on.  But I guess....

There's a joke associated with that, but I didn't get to it because I moved on.  (Jon facepalms to audience cheering and applause)  All right, forget it.  Let's go.
But I guess if you really sincerely believe this is a terrible program that Americans will hate, I have to respect your principled stand, Ted Cruz.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (8/1/2013): The Obama administration's plan is very simple.  It is to get as many Americans as possible addicted to the subsidies, addicted to the sugar, because they know the simple fact that in modern times, no major entitlement has ever gone into effect and then been undone.
Right.  But the sugar in your metaphor is, in this case, health insurance — something that can literally battle the effects of too much sugar.
You know how America is with entitlements, it's like crack to us.  You give us one small taste of Social Security, and suddenly we're all sucking the glass tit of not having our old people freeze to death and live off cat food.  (wild audience cheering and applause)
So that's it.  I don't understand any of this.  You're protecting America from this terrible Obamacare plan that once we get a taste of, we'll never want to be without.  You only win if the program fails.  Obamacare is your Springtime for Hitler.  It turns out the Republicans aren't afraid we're all going to get finger-banged by a puppet Uncle Sam.  They're afraid we gonna like it!  (audience laughter and applause)  We'll be right back.

First, the good news for Mitt Romney:
President Obama's job approval rating has plunged to the lowest of his presidency, according to a new CBS News poll released Wednesday, and Americans' approval of the Affordable Care Act has dropped it's lowest since CBS News started polling on the law.
Ouch—but not exactly surprising, given that even President Obama admits that the Obamacare rollout hasn't gone smoothly. I'm sure he'd love for those numbers to be higher, but the reality is that until things are turned around, these sorts of approval numbers aren't going to look good—nor should they. That's why the most important thing the administration can do is to make the policy work.
And that brings me to the second key finding in the poll, which has some bad news for Ted Cruz:
Just seven percent of Americans think the Affordable Care Act is working well and should be kept in place as it is. Far more, 48 percent, think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed to make it work better, and another 43 percent think the law needs to be repealed entirely.
So even though Obamacare now is pretty much at its lowest point ever, a clear majority opposes the Ted Cruz position, which is repealing it altogether. Moreover, support for repeal isn't exactly skyrocketing, despite all the problems of the past six weeks: that 43 percent figure is just 4 points higher than the 39 percent who supported repeal in CBS's July survey.
It's tempting to look at that 7 percent number as a very bad sign, but even the president doesn't take the position that the law is working perfectly and doesn't need changes. Like most Americans, Obama and the Democratic Party want Obamacare to work. On the other hand, Cruz—and pretty much the entire GOP—want it to fail. For them, it's repeal or bust. Changes to make it work better are off the table. If things get worse between now and November 2014, that position might work out for them, but if the program continues to improve, so will attitudes towards it, and Republicans will find themselves even more out of step with the public.

Last week, President Obama apologized for misleading the American public with his false claim that “if you like your insurance, you can keep it.” Without this assurance, it is unlikely ObamaCare would have passed. Obama was not the only politician fudging the truth. Most Democrat lawmakers repeated this claim on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents. If Obama apologized, they should as well, as they are equally culpable. 
Breitbart News has compiled a list of the Top 10 Senate Democrats who should follow Obama’s lead and apologize to the American public. These particular lawmakers either went all-in on the false claim for partisan reasons or were in a position to know that millions of Americans would not be able to keep their health insurance. 
If a reader interprets this list as a guide for whom to call in Congress, so be it. 
10. SEN. MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA): “If you like the insurance that you have, you’ll be able to keep it.” (MSNBC’s Hardball, 12/16/09)
Mary Landrieu, like all Senate Democrats, provided the deciding vote on passing ObamaCare. After 3 years, it is hard to remember all the parliamentary tricks the Democrats used to pass a bill that almost none of them had read. Landrieu, who is up for reelection next year, lied on TV. She should apologize. 
9. SEN. KAY HAGAN (D-NC): “We need to support the private insurance industry so that people who have insurance they’re happy with can keep it while also providing a backstop option for people without access to affordable coverage.” (“Republicans Vent As Other Compromise Plans Get Aired,” National Journal’s Congress Daily, 6/18/09)
160,000 residents of North Carolina has lost their health coverage. Sen. Hagan has been most aggressive in trying to separate herself from ObamaCare. No wonder, since even a Democrat poll has found her now in a statistical tie with any of her possible Republican challengers. In September,  Hagan held a 12-17 point lead. She is up for reelection next year and should apologize. 
8. SEN. MARK BEGICH (D-AK): “If you got a doctor now, you got a medical professional you want, you get to keep that. If you have an insurance program or a health care policy you want of ideas, make sure you keep it. That you can keep who you want.”
Begich won his Senate seat in 2008, after DOJ staffers trumped up false charges against the sitting GOP Senator Ted Stevens. Begich is running for reelection in Alaska, without the Obama wave and without a mythical DOJ investigation. He should apologize. 
7. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): “We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you like it, you can keep it. If you have your doctor, and you like him or her, you should be able to keep them as well. We will not take that choice away from you.”
Sen. Bennet heads to DSCC, the party arm to elect Democrats to the US Senate. He will have an outsized role in races across the country. He said his position on ObamaCare was based on a “basic principle.” He should apologize.  
6. SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D-WA): “Again, if you like what you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If you like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by the President, you will be able to keep it.” (Sen. Murray, Congressional Record, S.6400, 6/10/09)
Let me say this again, as a senior member, and now Chair of the Budget Committee, Sen. Murray must have been in a position to know that these claims were false. She won her first race for Senate campaigning as a “soccer mom” in “tennis shoes.” Insert your own joke. 290,000 residents of Washington have lost their health insurance. She should apologize. 
5. SEN. TOM HARKIN (D-IA): “One of the things we put in the health care bill when we designed it was the protection for consumers to keep the plan they have if they like it; thus, the term ‘grandfathered plans.’ If you have a plan you like –existing policies–you can keep them. …we said, if you like a plan, you get to keep it, and you can grandfather it in.” (Sen. Harkin, Congressional Record, S.7675-6, 9/29/10)
Sen. Harkin has long been a slippery politician. As Chair of the Health Committee in the Senate, Harkin would have had more intimate knowledge of ObamaCare than most other lawmakers. His yowler here is he tries to claim that the “put in” language to ensure people could keep the plan they like. That is a sin of commission. Harkin, who is retiring, should absolutely apologize. 
4. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): “If you like your insurance, you keep it.” (U.S. Senate, Finance Committee, Bill Mark-Up, 9/24/09)
Schumer, who was in a position to know the inner-workings of the law seems to have lied. Asking him for an apology, though, is like asking Anthony Weiner to become modestly self-aware. Still, he should apologize. 
3. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): “This bill before us on the Senate floor makes it clear that if you have an insurance policy that you like, you can keep it. If you like the doctor that you’re currently doing business with, you can continue to use that doctor.” (Sen. Durbin, Teleconference, 12/4/09)
Durbin is the Number 2 Democrat in the Senate, amazingly. He seems preternaturally disposed to obscuring the truth. He actually said the legislation “makes it clear” that you can keep your insurance. He either can’t read legislation or he was intentionally misleading the public. In any event, he should apologize. 
2.SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV):”In fact, one of our core principles is that if you like the health care you have, you can keep it.” (Sen. Reid, Congressional Record, S.8642, 8/3/09)
Core principles, apparently, aren’t what they used to be. Sen. Reid emptied out the parliamentary cupboard to get ObamaCare passed. As Majority Leader, he had to have a keen understanding of what was in the bill and what the consequences would be. The White House, at the time, was aware of the fact that many Americans would lose their health insurance. Surely, Sen. Reid was privy to the same information. He should apologize.
And, the #1 Senate Democrat who should apologize… 
1. SEN. MAX BAUCUS (D-MT): “That is why one of the central promises of health care reform has been and is: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is critically important. If a person has a plan, and he or she likes it, he or she can keep it.” (Sen. Baucus, Congressional Record, S.7676, 9/29/10)
Sen. Baucus wrote most of the bill that became ObamaCare. He has been steeped in health care policy for decades. He was in a position to know, and had to know, that the “central promise” that people could keep their current health care coverage was a lie.
He should apologize, but unfortunately, he has chosen to retire rather than face the voters. I can only hope he does not go softly into the night.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama said of his health care law: “Despite all the evidence that the law is working the way it’s supposed to,” there are critics out there. He says they must be doing it for purely political reasons. That sound you hear is the fire alarm going off in the White House. 
Shortly after the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or Obamacare) was signed into law on Mar. 23, 2010, the administration announced that the massive Title VIII of the law–the CLASS Act that would set up a national system of elderly case–would never be implemented, because the Obama administration cannot find any way either to implement the system or to pay for it. 
Over the past three years, the Obama administration has been issuing “waivers” for various ACA requirements regarding how much companies must pay out in health care benefits to employees, because many low-wage employers like McDonald’s couldn’t meet those requirements, and would have to cancel all health care benefits for those employees. (It should also be noted that the “waivers” are unlawful, because the ACA imposes that requirement on employers and does not allow the government to waive them.) 
A year ago, the Supreme Court struck down as a violation of the Tenth Amendment the mandatory expansion of Medicaid in all 50 states, making it entirely optional. The White House started scrambling when half the states in the nation refused to go along with this unaffordable and unmanageable expansion of government health care. 
Also a year ago, the IRS issued a new regulation saying that the massive subsidies that taxpayers would have to pay on health care policies purchased from state-run government exchanges in all 50 states would also apply to policies purchased on an exchange run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, because it became clear that many states would not participate in that government-run model either. (In fact, 34 states have refused to set up exchanges, and the IRS’s regulation is being challenged in court as illegal.) 
Then two weeks ago, the Treasury Department announced that for the first year it is in effect (2014), the IRS would not enforce the Employer Mandate requiring large employers to provide healthcare to employees. The system was ready to implode and deprive millions of Americans of both health care and work hours (forcing many employers to cut hours to 29/week for full-time employees), and the IRS could not develop an effective reporting or enforcement system. (Like the “waivers” above, this too is illegal.) 
And just this week, HHS announced that the massive state exchange system may be put off a year as well. It was supposed to start on Oct. 1, 2013, and is having so many severe problems that it too cannot start when the ACA says it must. 
Yet with all that, Obama says that the ACA is working great, and those who deny it must have sinister political motives. (Set aside the fact that now some of the ACA’s biggest critics are major unions like AFL-CIO and the Teamsters, normally Obama’s biggest allies and without whose zealous support the ACA would never have passed Congress.)
It’s like George Orwell’s 1984. The government literally could say 2+2=5, and no one would call them on it. If a conservative leader said such things, the media would call for his head. But when a liberal does it, they ignore it. (Or if you’re MSNBC, you applaud his “courage” and might offer him a TV show to anchor.)
If any private citizen said such things, we’d have a one-word label for him: “liar.” But most people in this country rightly show great respect for the institution of the presidency that we don’t use such terms (unless they’re committed liberals and the president happens to be a conservative Republican–in which case you can call him anything you want). Instead, we say he’s “got his facts wrong” or he’s using “fuzzy math,” or some other such softer statement. 
So using such a word would be disrespectful, and we won’t do it here. But if the smoke detectors go off at the White House, there’s no need to call the fire department. The smoke is because President Obama’s pants are on fire.

On Wednesday, as Tea Party activists rallied against the IRS and the Senate immigration bill on Capitol Hill, President Barack Obama’s campaign-turned-lobbying arm, Organizing for Action (OfA), emailed a warning about “threats on women’s health” in Congress. It urged its members to sign a petition against a “terrifying” decision the GOP “to stand between a woman and her doctor when it comes to her health care decisions.”
Meanwhile, for the past several weeks, Republicans have sent fundraising pitches to their donors expressing indignation over the IRS scandal, in which the agency targeted conservative groups on the basis of their names and views for additional, and excessive, scrutiny. They are seeking to capitalize on grass-roots outrage–outrage that is often equally directed at Republican leadership–as they ramp up campaign efforts for 2014.
The OfA email about abortion is a re-hash of the 2012 presidential campaign’s “war on women” theme–and is aided, once again, by the mainstream media’s eagerness to focus on conservative gaffes, to the exclusion of mistakes by the president or members of his party. In addition to the abortion issue, Democrats are seizing on controversy over sexual assault in the military to signal to female voters that they are fighting for them.
The abortion issue has, in fact, gained new poignancy–though not in a way that favors the pro-choice side. The trial and conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell for the gruesome murders of babies delivered at his abortion clinic was ignored by the mainstream media but inspired pro-life activists to press for legislation limiting abortions past 20 weeks–the bill that inspired the OfA email but which, curiously, it does not describe.
Democrats are clearly worried about a midterm lull–which is why they have not only found it necessary to re-ignite old issues, but to share, selectively, in conservative outrage. As the IRS scandal has unfolded, for example, Democrats have strained to argue that “progressive” and liberal non-profits were also “targeted” by the IRS. Some Democrats have also split openly with the White House over the NSA and Prism scandals.
Meanwhile, Republicans are buoyed by a sense that frustration at the Obama administration scandals will help bring millions of conservative voters back to the polls after many apparently sat out the 2012 contest. The redistricting that followed the 2010 elections will also help ensure the party holds the House. But the race for the Senate has pit the GOP establishment against the base, as have issues like immigration reform. 
In that context, the IRS scandal represents a rare point of unity, which is why even those Republicans busily defending the NSA’s surveillance programs against the party’s resurgent libertarian wing are citing the IRS scandal as a legitimate grievance. The full extent of the IRS abuses is unknown, and questions remain about who ordered the targeting, and why. Yet the issue has already become part of the 2014 election lexicon.
Midterm elections typically have lower turnout than presidential elections, which is why the 2014 effort by both sides will be aimed at motivating their party’s base voters. Republicans already have a wide variety of new conservative grievances to harness; Democrats are, thus far, returning to themes that have worked in the past. In the thick of the fight, the actual issues at the core of these debates risk being hijacked or obscured."
420,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/10/1261631/-The-REAL-reason-Republicans-hate-healthcare-gov,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,*UPDATED* Take Action! The REAL reason Republicans hate healthcare.gov,"

Last night, I applied for insurance on healthcare.gov. I'm one of those so-called ""uninsurables"" - insurance companies declined to cover me because I have... allergies (way!). So, while I was gratified to have completed the enrollment process, I believe I stumbled across the real reason Republicans have been trying to scare the public away from the ACA website.
Join me over the orange caduceus to see what I discovered.


Oh sure, there are plenty of stories circulating now - like Joan's FP post today - about people finally being able to get quality, affordable health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. But that's only half the story.
After I was successfully enrolled (which by the way only took half an hour for myself, my wife, and my three offspring), I was almost instantly given the news that I qualify for coverage! Yay! followed by a page of other news about the new law. I've been keenly interested so I was already aware of most of that information.
The one exceptional item - the thing that I am convinced has Republicans foaming at the mouth - was buried at the end of that page.
Here's an actual screenshot from my session:

Do you see it? Do you understand why the Republicans have been so anxious to ""kill the bill?"" Pronouncing the website a train wreck, trying to keep people away?
Here, let me make it a little easier to see:

Still can't see it? Let me zoom in real close:

Right there, on that page, is everything the Republicans hate: a program designed to help people of modest means, run by the government - AND giving those same people an opportunity to exercise their franchise.
If there really was a left-wing conspiracy funded by George Soros, I'd put in an expense request to get the list of people who had created an account on healthcare.gov, and around October 1, 2014 I'd mail them each a postcard with a very simple message:
You know that health plan that you signed up for last year? Democrats made that happen. Not a single Republican voted for it. In fact Republicans did everything they could to keep it from happening. Remember that when you vote.
Demonstrating that government works (when the right people are in charge) - and then telling the people that same government just helped that they can do something to keep government working? No wonder the Republicans are in a frenzy.
UPDATE 1:51pm EST (scoop won't let me use the update feature)
Reclist? thanks everyone! (first time)
As a follow-up - as noted in the comments, just because people can register to vote does not necessarily mean they will exercise that right - either by habit, or because of obstacles Republicans are trying to put in the way. In either case, the answer is the same: stay engaged. Don't agonize, organize!
UPDATE 2 10:00am 11-Dec-2013 (scoop apparently doesn't like my Chrome installation, either)
First, let me apologize for leaving out the VA/Tricare option from the poll. ""Tricare for all"" would be an excellent improvement to our health care delivery system.
Several commenters noted that the ACA would be saving their families a lot of money starting next year. Others pointed out that due to the increased competition, their employer-sponsored plans were going to be MUCH cheaper, saving the company and employees thousands of dollars.
By coincidence (and I don't believe in coincidence), I got an email this morning from Families USA, an advocacy group that has been pushing for better healthcare for all Americans. They have set up a website and a Facebook campaign to make it easier to share these kinds of success stories. So if you have one to tell, please do!
Families USA MyCoverageStory.org website

Families USA ACA success story Facebook campaign

Dear Mark,
This holiday season, there's one big thing we're thankful for – that the online health care marketplaces opened, giving millions of uninsured Americans the opportunity to enroll in health coverage.
But, while we're grateful for this opportunity, we're also thinking about the millions of Americans who haven't yet signed up for coverage because they don't yet know that they qualify.
The best way to ensure that everyone who is eligible actually signs up for coverage is to spread the word and highlight stories of successful enrollment. But to do that, we need your help.
Mark, spreading the word is easy, and it makes a big difference. Simply share our Facebook post with your followers and help spread the word about the benefits of health coverage that the Affordable Care Act now provides.
Or, draft your own post and share why this issue is important to you. It might not seem like much, but the more people who share, the broader our reach, and the more people we can encourage to enroll.

Sorry, guys. Your dream of Obamacare repeal hasn't arrived.



Sorry, guys. Your dream of Obamacare repeal hasn't arrived.

As Joan wrote earlier, House Republicans have scheduled a 1PM ET vote on their ""fix"" for health plan cancellations. But even though Republicans claim their bill will achieve a policy goal shared by both congressional Democrats and the White House—allowing people to keep their current health care plans if they want to keep them—it's not going to attract many votes from the Democratic side of the aisle, and the fundamental reason for that is simple: The Republican plan is nothing but Obamacare repeal with a different name, and no matter what Ted Cruz tells himself, Democrats are never going to embrace Obamacare repeal.
Not only would it be political malfeasance for Democrats to run away from Obamacare after spending three years supporting it, running away from the notion that all Americans deserve affordable, quality health insurance would be immoral. That's not to say they won't support changes and adjustments to Obamacare, but the House GOP plan isn't a simple tweak: By allowing insurers to sign up new customers to grandfathered plans, it would create an entirely new health insurance marketplace designed to compete with Obamacare, a marketplace without regulations or protections.
Yes, unregulated plans would probably be cheaper, at least initially, but they'd also be junk, and the costs of the good plans on the exchanges would skyrocket. Moreover, the House GOP plan would keep the mandate in place, so people would be forced to choose between exchange plans (which would be much more expensive than they are now) or junk insurance. It's not hard to see why most House Democrats have figured out it would be insane to vote for this, especially given the fact they are offering an alternative plan that actually would achieve the goal Republicans claim to be pursuing: Allowing existing consumers of health plans to continue their plans if they want.
Unlike the Republican plan, which leaves it up to insurers to decide whether they want to let consumers continue their plan, the House Democratic plan would let consumers make the decision. And it would do it without taking a wrecking a ball to Obamacare. For all the drama and speculation, at the end of the day, what we're going to see is nothing has really changed: Republicans are still fundamentally opposed to Obamacare, both in principle and practice, and Democrats support it.

In the wake of Sandy Hook, to justify openly pressuring Congress to restrict our Second Amendment gun rights, the national media frequently pointed to polls showing majority public support for laws that would broaden the scope of background checks. When this law failed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, the media bellyached for weeks about the filibuster and the GOP “obstructionism” that thwarts the will of the people. 
This is not a new kind of media attack against the political right. Ever since Obama assumed the presidency, under the guise of reporting, the media have attacked our “do nothing” congress as dysfunctional and incapable of accomplishing anything. According to the media, a legislative body  “doing nothing” is a huge problem. As the media push to see millions of Democrats legalized through immigration reform, look for this media narrative to explode at the GOP Congress. 
But in reality, we all know that this is wild hypocrisy and that our media see some obstructionists who thwart the will of the people as a lot more equal than others. 
Take for instance, State Senator Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who is now a full-fledged national Media Dahling after her 11-hour filibuster managed to block the Texas Senate from passing laws that would have outlawed abortion after 20 weeks and made abortion clinics safer. 
As I write this, Davis is being hailed all across the national news as a courageous, principled, instant superstar. ABC News, CBS News, The Washington Post… all hailed her obstructionism. Left-wing cable news outlets — CNN and MSNBC — were  just as gushing; as were the morning news shows. 
Anyone familiar with our media knows what the Media Narrative is here — all about gender politics, “reproductive rights,” and any other buzzword that can be utilized to place Wendy Davis astride a white horse, and her political opponents grunting away in that Neanderthal cave known as Texas. 
Naturally, though, most of the national media are ignoring any pertinent facts inconvenient to their agenda. Here are five of them:
1. The Texas Bill will Make Abortion Safer: After the horrors discovered at the clinic of abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell (which the media all-but ignored), many of which were only possible due to the local government’s politically motivated lack of oversight towards abortion clinics, Texas decided to act to make abortion safer. One of the primary objectives of the bill Davis filibustered is to ensure that women who seek a legal abortion are properly cared for. 
This is what is in the bill Davis obstructed, and what some in media are cynically and dishonestly portraying as a move to force abortion clinics to close:
In truth, clinics would close only if they failed to meet new safety standards that have been drawn in response to the horror stories in Philadelphia and Houston. The new rules, as summarized by the Texas Alliance for Life, would have “increase[d] abortion facility safety standards to the level of ambulatory surgical centers to shut down Gosnell-like abortion providers in Texas,” “require[d] the 18,000 RU-486 abortions performed each year be done according to FDA safety standards,” and “require[d] physicians who perform abortions to be qualified to treat life-threatening complications after botched abortions and have privileges at a local hospital.”
2. The American People Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of the American people who, by 48% to 44%, favor what’s in the Texas bill: a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. A full 80% want abortion banned after the second trimester. 
3. A Majority of American Women Back the Ban: Davis also obstructed the will of American women, who support a ban on abortion after 20 weeks at a higher percentage than men, 50% to 44%. 
4. A Huge Majority of Texans Back the Ban: Davis obstructed the will of Texans; almost two-thirds (62%)  of whom  favor this ban on abortion after 20 weeks. 
5.  Late-term Abortion Ban Is More Popular with Women than ObamaCare: Yep.
—
We could add a number 6. Abortion is especially horrific after just a few weeks. Here is a fact the media never-ever report on, what the act of abortion really is:
At six weeks, the baby’s brain, spinal cord, and central nervous system are all pretty well formed — in outline at least. By the two-month mark, sensory organs begin to develop and bone replaces cartilage. …
At each of these stages, had the bill been passed, it would have remained legal in Texas to kill the child. The law that Wendy Davis and her fellow “pro-science” acolytes so bravely stood against would have rendered it illegal to kill the child after this point. And when I say kill, I mean kill. I mean break bones, rip apart limbs, crush skulls, drain fluids, still a beating heart, annihilate a brain that is capable of dreaming, and crush a nervous system. I mean: Kill.
Other than winning Barack Obama elections, nothing brings out our media’s bias, dishonesty, and hypocrisy like the issue of abortion. 
My thanks to Charles W. Cooke over at National Review whose superb Tuesday editorial both inspired this post and made it possible.

Resurgent Republic, an outfit of GOP pollsters, has some advice to Republicans regarding the government shutdown. Let's take a gander, why don't we, below the fold.



1. Obamacare remains a political albatross for Democrats, but a government shutdown has proven to be more toxic to voters.
The shutdown is toxic to voters, but how much of an albatross can Obamacare be for Democrats when they handily won the 2012 elections? It's true, more people disapprove of the law, but the polling also consistently shows that 1) people don't understand the law, and 2) people support individual components of the law. That's why Republicans haven't been able to capitulate on the supposed opposition to it, it's why people don't want to see the law defunded, and certainly not via government shutdown, and why support for the law is increasing as people start paying more attention to it.
2. The plan of using a government shutdown to spark a national discussion on Obamacare fell flat.
No shit.
3. While the White House and some in the media view the government
shutdown through the lens of the Tea Party, the intransigent factions of Republicans and Democrats are equal in size.
Somehow, the fact that Democrats want Democrats to hold firm means something to these guys. Not sure why. Fact is, the government shutdown is being viewed through the lens of the Tea Party because they are responsible for it. It's true, the terrorist gets more attention than his victims.
4. Women are following the government shutdown more closely than men, and that should be concerning for Republicans.
Memo to GOP pollsters at Resurgent Republic: that ""rebranding"" thing was soooo January 2013.
We entered the government shutdown certain of one thing:
there will be no shortage of blame to go around. Above 50 percent in January,
President Obama’s job approval now registers in the low-to-mid 40’s, and voters
are increasingly pessimistic about the direction of the country
Obama hasn't seen 50 percent approval since February, so the fact that he was above 50 percent at the time is irrelevant to how the shutdown is playing. If you look at a more narrow slice of time, as in the last week, the president has actually seen his numbers go up in the most recent NBC/WSJ, Rasmussen (ha!), and Fox (ha ha!) polls and has been mostly stable according to everyone else.
Now that they've surveyed the state of public opinion (as well as Republicans can, being that they are Republican), they now get down to giving some advice. Try not to cringe too much.
Public opinion remains stacked against Obamacare, and this is problematic for Senate Democrats in red states, so conservatives should look to 2014 and highlight Obamacare’s policy and implementation woes along the way.
In reality, November 2014 can't get here soon enough. Even in those Red states like North Carolina, Louisiana, and even Arkansas. Heck, Republicans actually need to start worrying about their own Red states of Georgia and Kentucky.
The reasonableness of President Obama has been tarnished in the shutdown.
No evidence, other than the fervent wishes of conservative pollsters, apparently.
The president strikes a harsh chord when his message to Congress and the American people is a barrage about not negotiating rather than leading a divided government
He sounds a principled, strong chord. You say ""tomato"", I say ""good luck with that, buddy.""
Let’s remember, not long ago voters believed Mitt Romney, not President Obama, was better able to bridge the partisan divide
And Mitt Romney won!
Habitually labeling Republicans as arsonists and hostage takers reminds voters of the president’s own weakness in this area.
This'll certainly be a problem for Obama's 2016 reelection bid, given how it made him lose in 2012.
While this is not your 90’s shutdown, it is not an envious position for Republicans either
It's worse than your 90s shutdown.
If Republicans can put the shutdown dysfunction in their rear view mirror, they can move to a more favorable playing field, connecting with a majority of Independents who want the government to stop spending money it doesn’t have.
That's the biggest fucking ""if"" I have ever seen. Before they can put any shutdown dysfunction in their rear view mirror they have to capitulate to Obama and the Democrats by providing a clean continuing budget resolution and a clean raising of the debt limit. And if they do that, the party's fringy base will explode, littering that ""favorable playing field"" with the debris of a once-vibrant national party.
But let's say they do that, and the GOP ""connects"" with those independents ... so what? Romney won Independents in 2012 by a 50-45 margin. ""Independent"" includes ""teabaggers and other assorted conservatives too embarrassed to say they are Republicans"". The big question is whether the GOP can connect with moderates, who were 41 percent of the 2012 electorate and went to Obama by a whopping 56-41 margin.

Among the more bizarre moments of Senator Cruz's fake filibuster tonight was his reading of the Dr. Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham from the floor of the U.S. Senate.  
Shortly after 8 p.m., Cruz announced he would begin reading ""bedtime stories"" to his two young daughters . . .  Then he read the Dr. Seuss classic, ""Green Eggs and Ham,"" in its entirety, noting that it was one of his favorite children's books.
http://www.washingtonpost.com/...
This is an odd choice of a book for Senator Cruz to read in that its message actually supports the position of the Democrats that the Affordable Care Act (otherwise known as Obamacare) should be allowed to go into effect as scheduled.
In the story Green Eggs and Ham, the narrator starts by telling the reader how he does not like Green Eggs and Ham under any circumstance.  A lot of the book contains lists of circumstances under which the narrator would not eat Green Eggs and Ham.  For example:
I do not like them
in a house.
I do not like them
with a mouse.
I do not like them
here or there.
I do not like them
anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-I-am.
http://answers.yahoo.com/...
Then the narrator, after much urging by Sam-I-Am, eats the green eggs and ham to prove Sam-I-Am wrong.  However, much to the narrator's surprise, he actually likes Green Eggs and Ham.  
Say!
I like green eggs and ham!
I do!! I like them, Sam-I-am!
And I would eat them in a boat!
And I would eat them with a goat...
And I will eat them in the rain.
And in the dark. And on a train.
And in a car. And in a tree.
They are so good so good you see!
http://answers.yahoo.com/...
The narrator then goes on to actually thank Sam-I-Am for encouraging him to try the Green Eggs and Ham.
I do so like
green eggs and ham!
Thank you!
Thank you,
Sam-I-am
http://answers.yahoo.com/...
Senator Cruz-Obamacare is like Green Eggs and Ham.  Like the narrator in the story, some people have come to the conclusion (after hearing a lot of right wing propaganda) that they won't like Obamacare even though they have never tried it.    A lot of their opposition is based on their fear of trying something different from what they are used to.   However, like the narrator in the story, once the American people try Obamacare, I think that they will like it.  And like the narrator in the story who thanks Sam-I-Am for forcing him to try the green eggs and ham, I think that the American People will ultimately thank President Obama and the Democrats for Obamacare.

If Ayn Rand is, in the words of Robert Reich, ""the philosophical guru of the modern Republican Party,"" then the billionaire, Rand-worshipping Koch brothers are its paymasters. Now they've launched a new campaign of lies, aiming their pocketbook at Obamacare, or, more accurately, at those who stand to benefit from its reforms. You know, small, ""special-interest"" groups like, say: women (and the people who love them), young people between the ages of 19 and 26, as well as others (and their affected families) who can't get coverage at work, or lose coverage when they lose their job, or can't get coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Does that sound to you like just about all of us at one point in our lives? Yeah, me too.
The Koch brothers' campaign is merely part of a larger, truly unprecedented Republican strategy to sabotage the entire health care law passed in 2009 by a Democratic House and Senate and signed by President Obama.
The Republicans need the law to fail because its success will only further cement the reality that government regulations can and do bring tangible benefits to people. In other words, the law's success will translate into further defeats for their party and for their extreme anti-government ideology. This has been the Republican thinking on health care reform for 20 years. Will the Koch/Republican campaign succeed? Not if we can help it.
These thoughts were on my mind as I had a conversation with a physician I know, an obstetrician-gynecologist. The physician mentioned a patient who asked if the implementation of Obamacare would alter her relationship with her doctor or the practice in general. The patient was quite concerned, unsurprisingly, as change can be unsettling—especially change relating to one's health care.
The physician put the patient at ease, explaining that the patient-doctor relationship would not change, that she'd be able to continue seeing her current doctor. On the other hand, the Koch brothers' ad includes ""Julie"" asking: ""If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know our family is going to get the care they need?"" Of course, there's nothing in the health care legislation that reduces a patient's ability to choose his or her own doctor.
For the rest of the conversation, please follow me beyond the fold.


The physician also informed her patient that, not only wouldn't their relationship change, the new law has some very specific benefits relating to her gynecologic and obstetrical care that have already taken effect. First, insurers are now mandated to cover contraceptive care with no patient co-pays. Unless one works for a house of worship (they were exempted under a compromise plan announced in February), one is guaranteed this coverage. Second, insurers must now fully cover breast pumps for nursing mothers (the law requires coverage for the cost of renting a pump, although many insurers decided also to cover the cost of purchase as well).
In other words, Obamacare makes it easier for a woman to control when she will become a mother, and easier for her to feed her children in a way of her choosing, despite the obstacles work and life may throw in the way. Two pretty important benefits, among many others.
This is the kind of information that can counter the lies put forth by the Koch brothers. Women and all of us deserve the truth.

Apparently the media is growing tired of the White House selectively releasing ObamaCare data that gets to the heart of nothing but makes the program look like it is much more popular than it likely is. For instance, today the White House informed the media that between Sunday and Friday, Healthcare.gov enjoyed 3.7 million visits. 
We have also been told  that the site’s error rate was .077 percent, the response time averaged under a second, and a whopping (and improbable) 93% of consumers did come back later after they were asked to due to the site being too busy. 
As The Hill points out, though, that data is all hollow happy talk that tells us nothing about what really matters. What the White House refuses to disclose, or claims it doesn’t yet have the data to disclose, just happens to be the information that will tell us if ObamaCare is or is not working:
The Obama administration is selectively releasing data and metrics on ObamaCare to bolster its case that the rollout is going better in the month of December.
Tidbits of information from federal health officials — especially figures that show improvements at HealthCare.gov — have become a key tool in the effort to “reboot” the law in the eyes of the public.
But the limited nature of the releases has created conflict with the media and put the spotlight on outstanding areas of concern for the rollout, such as the enrollment site’s back end.
The White House has blithely changed the definition of the world “enrollee” to someone who has not yet enrolled, but has only selected an insurance plan and placed it into a shopping cart. Studies show that the abandonment rate for shopping carts is 67%. 
Up until now, though, the media have breathlessly reported “enrollment” numbers spoon-fed to them by the White House without doing any of their own independent reporting to find out how many have actually enrolled. Maybe those days are coming to an end. 
The Hill points out the other vital metrics the White House has thus far not released:
Since late October, federal health officials have touted traffic to the site, error rates and page load times almost daily in an effort to illustrate positive changes.
Enrollment figures are only discussed monthly, and leaked sign-up numbers are not confirmed. Vital information for judging the growing risk pools, such as applicants’ ages, goes undiscussed.
The administration appears to have largely chosen data over anecdotes as the most powerful way to communicate site improvements to the media.
The metrics released are difficult to independently verify, but provide easy headlines and talking points for anxious supporters of the Affordable Care Act, including congressional Democrats.
Another area where the White House has dissembled rather than been forthcoming involves the number of meetings between Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and President Obama during the three years after the passage of ObamaCare. A Government Accountability Institute study finds only a single meeting between the two recorded on any White House calendar or log. Friday, Jay Carney would only say that the two met frequently, but provided no details. 
While we are sure to be hit with all kinds of selective data leaks before the end of the year that are only meant to make ObamaCare look successful, The Hill reports that a number that will not be released until the end of the year is a breakdown of those who are truly enrolled — in other words, those who have actually paid for a premium.
The fact that the White House always has positive data that sounds good but means nothing, but never the data that matters, has raised the suspicions of the American people from the beginning. It is good to know now, that after two-plus months of this Administration Hustle, the media has apparently had enough.

The health care exchanges—federal and state—are now functioning and not sucking up all the oxygen around the implementation of Obamacare. Finally, the ""good news"" news stories are finally being told, like this one in The New York Times.
Since his chronic leukemia was diagnosed in 2010, Ray Acosta has paid dearly for health insurance: more than $800 a month in premiums, plus steep co-payments for the drug that helps keep him alive.
Mr. Acosta, 57, owns a small moving company in Sierra Vista, Ariz., which he said had barely made it through the recession. He was thinking about dropping his coverage, but the insurance company beat him to it, informing him recently that it would cancel his policy at year’s end.
He sought advice from an insurance agent who had used his moving company. She connected him with an application counselor at a community health center, who found — to Mr. Acosta’s astonishment — that he qualified for Medicaid under the new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, which gives states the option of expanding the program to include more low-income adults.
“I’m kind of in a disbelieving fog,” Mr. Acosta said last week, two days after completing an application. “I’m just hoping, keeping my fingers crossed, that this might really help me out.” [...] “After being gouged all these years, trying to make ends meet, to all of the sudden get this?” he said. “I’m really blown away.” [...]

That's the kind of story that makes Republicans quake in their shoes. For more of them, go below the fold.



The good news keeps coming.
Claire He grew up worrying about her parents’ health. Her mother, who is a waitress, and her father, who is a cook, work long days at a Chinese restaurant in Battle Creek, Mich., where they settled after immigrating from China 14 years ago. Health insurance has always been a luxury they could not afford. [...]
This Thanksgiving, she and her family sat down to explore their options in the new insurance marketplace. After about 45 minutes online, they selected a midlevel, or silver, plan that would cost the family about $30 a month, after tax-credit subsidies based on income.
“We were shocked,” Ms. He said. “I actually called a few places to verify that.” [...]
At 61 years old, Bruce Kleinschmidt, a lawyer who is mostly retired, has no illusions about whether he needs health insurance. He has a chronic sinus condition that has required three operations, including one last year, and has had a few serious accidents over the years, including a fall that required back surgery. Doctors also recently diagnosed a heart condition. [...]
“I have been declined before,” he said.
The coverage available through the state high-risk pools for people like him, Mr. Kleinschmidt said, typically have “extraordinarily high premiums with really high deductibles.” On the state’s new online exchange, he was able to select a plan from a well-known insurer that came with a deductible of only $1,000.
“It’s a godsend,” he said. [...]
Tasha Huebner, 45, had long wanted to leave Chicago, but one of the biggest roadblocks was the fear of losing her health insurance. Ms. Huebner learned that she had breast cancer five years ago and, given her costly medical history, knew the chances of a new insurer accepting her were slim.
So when she finally sold her house and moved to Silverton, Ore., this year, she did so knowing that the new health care law would soon make it much easier for people like her to get coverage. Under the law, insurers cannot turn away people with existing medical conditions, nor charge them more for coverage. [...]
So she turned to the new exchange after it opened on Oct. 1. Oregon’s online marketplace has not worked properly, but Ms. Huebner figured out that a midlevel plan would cost her about $300 a month — within her budget. If she qualifies for subsidies — which is uncertain, given her unpredictable income —her bill may drop to about $150, she said. She applied through the mail and is awaiting approval.
Ms. Huebner said she is in good health and is training for two half-marathons. But she needs annual mammograms and checkups with an oncologist, and she lives with the knowledge that her cancer could return.
“I’m young,” she said. “The chances are that it will come back.”
For that reason, she said, being able to afford health insurance is “just a huge, huge relief.”

That's precisely what Republicans have been fighting against so desperately for the past four years; people's lives being made fundamentally better. People realizing that government can be a direct force for good in their personal lives. It's every Republican's nightmare, and it's going to play out in every state until next November.

On Tuesday, NBC News reporter and MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell revealed she did not know that lawmakers in Congress must be enrolled in Obamacare. Her remarks bolster Rep. Sean Duffy’s (R-WI) claim that the mainstream press may be both ill-prepared and unwilling to critically question the Obama administration on its signature healthcare legislation. 
Appearing on Mitchell Reports, Duffy and Mitchell got into a contested debate about whether a one-year delay of the individual mandate, which Republicans want as part of a short-term resolution to fund the government, was negotiable and whether the mainstream media has properly questioned the administration on Obamacare. 
At one point during the exchange, Duffy said:


And why won’t he join us in ObamaCare? Why wasn’t Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for ObamaCare? Or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan that they’re in and they don’t-


Mitchell then responded, “So do you.” 
Instantly, Duffy replied that he did not have a “gold-plated” plan because he had to be on Obamacare: 


No I’m not, I’m in ObamaCare. I’m in ObamaCare, Andrea. All members of Congress are, and my family. The President should join us in ObamaCare, and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should all be treated equally under the law? Why should members of Congress be in ObamaCare and not the President? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair?


Duffy continued to ask Mitchell if she could “defend why the President shouldn’t be in ObamaCare like members of Congress and their staffs?”
“I think the media should start doing its job,” Duffy said.
Mitchell, visibly annoyed, then semi-sardonically responded, “Thanks for your advice. Thank you, Congressman.”
Earlier in the interview, Mitchell insisted Duffy’s demands were “non-negotiable” before Duffy said Obama is essentially saying, “I get my gold-plated health care plan but I want members of Congress and the rest of America to be in ObamaCare.” 
He then pointed out that a big issue many Americans have with the media is that the it does not ask the question, “Why are you treating families different than big businesses?” 
“You need Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to ask Secretary Sebelius, ‘Hey, why won’t you treat these two equally?'” Duffy said. “And she can’t answer it. I mean, that’s how pathetic I think news reporting has become, when we won’t ask tough questions to the administration.”
Duffy kept pressing Mitchell and asked her if she and her colleagues have asked Obama and those in his administration, “Why do you want your own health care and you won’t join us in ObamaCare?” 
After Mitchell surmised what she thought Sebelius’s response would be to such a question, Duffy pointed out Mitchell could not point out how Sebelius has answered the question because members of the mainstream press have not posed it to her. "
429,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/25/Two-Cheers-for-Ted,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Two Cheers for Ted,"
The pundits in D.C. jeered as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) began his lengthy speech (a “fauxlibuster,” they joked) on Tuesday. Some cast it as a self-serving gesture, done to impress “dumb” people outside the Beltway who don’t get that defunding Obamacare just isn’t possible. But as the night wore on, it was clear that Cruz’s stand was as passionate and articulate an attack on Obamacare and a defense of liberty as the nation has ever seen.
A few even began to see its wisdom, circulating an essay by David Frum acknowledging that even a defeat served Cruz’s political purposes. Charles Krauthammer, who the day before had traded jokes about Cruz’s Canadian birth, acknowledged on Tuesday that he had executed a brilliant maneuver, if not to defeat Obamacare than to highlight its flaws, and to seize the mantle of leadership of a conservative movement needing inspiration.
What was most impressive about Cruz’s gambit, however, was not the strategy but the substance. In plain language, Cruz laid out the fundamental problems with Obamacare as policy, outlining the cost to working families in higher insurance premiums, dropped health plans, and lost work hours or job opportunities. He also reminded Washington of how the bill was passed, and upheld, in defiance of the people and the Constitution.
A few Democrats eventually wandered down to the Senate floor to debate Cruz, some to try poking holes in his arguments, reminding him that President Barack Obama had won a new mandate from the voters even after passing the Affordable Care Act. Cruz patiently, and deftly, handled their objections, noting that even the unions were turning against the law, and blasting both sides for approving congressional exemptions from it.
It was also difficult not to be moved by Cruz’s passion. No empty gesture could sustain the hours upon hours of explication, analysis, and debate that Cruz tackled on the Senate floor. Agree or disagree with his decision to force the issue into a debate over the budget and the debt ceiling, it is impossible not to be impressed by his sheer will, and by the self-evident sincerity of a man so fluent and ardent in his arguments.
It occurred to me that when I ran for Congress in 2010, and voters would urge me to “do something” if I got to Washington, that this is the type of “something” they meant. They know that a freshman in Congress is barely even worth his or her vote but that a person willing to take risks can change history. And millions went to bed last night knowing someone on Capitol Hill was, finally, keeping watch over their liberty as they slept.
There was one flaw in Cruz’s approach, however. It became clear in the reactions of those who might otherwise have supported his effort but were put off by his attacks on fellow Republicans. Cruz sometimes turned sincere disagreement over tactics into differences in courage and conviction. Despite Cruz’s moderate demeanor, his rhetoric sometimes reflected a political media culture mired in the language of absolutes.
Cruz has withstood intense hostility with uncommon grace, but he should reserve terms like “surrender caucus” and Neville Chamberlain analogies for real enemies if he wants to rally the broader support he deserves. Overall, however, his stand was brilliant. His remarks should be printed separately as a primer on Obamacare, and his tactics should inspire the opposition. He will soon run out of time. But he has turned the tide."
430,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/12/Mike-Lee-on-GAI-Findings-Inexcusable-Unpardonable,News,Breitbart,Republican,Mike Lee: Lack of Meetings Between Obama and Sebelius 'Inexcusable',"

On Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said it was “inexcusable” and “unpardonable” that President Barack Obama did not meet one-on-one with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius since Obamacare passed over three years ago. 
On Fox News’s Hannity, host Sean Hannity referenced the shocking Government Accountability Institute report when asking Lee whether he knew if Sebelius has met with Obama in one-on-one meetings. 
“Not to my knowledge,” Lee answered, before saying, “this is inexcusable” and “absolutely unpardonable.” 
Lee, who was the architect of the strategy to defund Obamacare and one of the fiercest opponents of the healthcare overhaul, continued by saying “there was this little oversight in the launching of this significant an enterprise” and Obamacare is “so much more than about the website.” Lee said ultimately Obamacare is about the “fundamental unfairness and unworkability of the law.”
At a House subcommittee hearing on Wednesday, Sebelius was flustered when asked to give specific evidence that she and Obama have met “regularly.” Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA), who is on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, exclusively told Breitbart News that he will ask Sebelius for specific dates of those alleged meetings. 
The White House and the Health and Human Services Department have claimed Obama and Sebelius meet “regularly,” but have not provided any firm dates except for an alleged meeting last Thursday, which was a day after the GAI report was released. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said there are many meetings between Obama and cabinet secretaries that are not on the public record. 
When Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large and Government Accountability Institute President Peter Schweizer broke the GAI report on Fox News’s Hannity last Wednesday, though, he mentioned that GAI examined the White House visitor logs and found that whenever Sebelius went to the White House, it was for social functions with “dozens or hundreds of people.” He noted on Hannity that if Obama met with Sebelius and left the meetings off the books, Sebelius would be the only cabinet secretary whose meetings with the White House were concealed.
The Government Accountability Institute report found that since Obamacare was signed into law on March 23, 2010, Obama met with “various Cabinet secretaries a total of 277 times,” but his presidential schedule did not “document a single one-on-one meeting” with Sebelius. There was “one instance of Secretary Sebelius meeting jointly with the President and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner.”
According to the White House schedule, Obama “met with secretaries from the Departments of Defense, State, and Treasury for 263 (95%) out of his 277 face-to-face meetings.” Obama also had meetings with “secretaries from the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Justice, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs… [including] two meetings with the Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus (not an official Cabinet level post).”
Schweizer had previously said there was no evidence on the White House schedule that showed Obama cared about Obamacare.
“In the case of President Obama, if you look at his calendar, there is no evidence whatsoever that he is focused or has much interest in health care at all,” Schweizer said on Hannity on Wednesday.

First, the good news for Mitt Romney:
President Obama's job approval rating has plunged to the lowest of his presidency, according to a new CBS News poll released Wednesday, and Americans' approval of the Affordable Care Act has dropped it's lowest since CBS News started polling on the law.
Ouch—but not exactly surprising, given that even President Obama admits that the Obamacare rollout hasn't gone smoothly. I'm sure he'd love for those numbers to be higher, but the reality is that until things are turned around, these sorts of approval numbers aren't going to look good—nor should they. That's why the most important thing the administration can do is to make the policy work.
And that brings me to the second key finding in the poll, which has some bad news for Ted Cruz:
Just seven percent of Americans think the Affordable Care Act is working well and should be kept in place as it is. Far more, 48 percent, think there are some good things in the law, but changes are needed to make it work better, and another 43 percent think the law needs to be repealed entirely.
So even though Obamacare now is pretty much at its lowest point ever, a clear majority opposes the Ted Cruz position, which is repealing it altogether. Moreover, support for repeal isn't exactly skyrocketing, despite all the problems of the past six weeks: that 43 percent figure is just 4 points higher than the 39 percent who supported repeal in CBS's July survey.
It's tempting to look at that 7 percent number as a very bad sign, but even the president doesn't take the position that the law is working perfectly and doesn't need changes. Like most Americans, Obama and the Democratic Party want Obamacare to work. On the other hand, Cruz—and pretty much the entire GOP—want it to fail. For them, it's repeal or bust. Changes to make it work better are off the table. If things get worse between now and November 2014, that position might work out for them, but if the program continues to improve, so will attitudes towards it, and Republicans will find themselves even more out of step with the public.

If there is at least one benefit of ObamaCare it is watching those who supported nationalizing the purchase of mandated health insurance get their comeuppance. The New York Times reports that “many in New York’s professional and cultural elite” who supported Obama and ObamaCare, and carved themselves out a sweet little health insurance pool “to avoid the sky-high rates in New York’s individual insurance market,” are now out in the cold with the rest of us:
[U]nder the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage. 
The anguish these elite Obama supporters are going through is no different than those 5.9 million in the real world victimized by insurance cancelations: Stress, sleepless nights, financial burden, and the loss of familiar doctors and hospitals. “We are Obama’s people,” said one author. Today her insurance has been canceled and her doctors are not available through the exchanges. And she is not alone. Take Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan. “I couldn’t sleep because of it,” she said.
Ms. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.
Ms. Meinwald also looked on the state’s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. “It’s like you’re blindfolded and you’re told that you have to buy something,” she said. …
Meinwald now says that had she known this would happen, she would have voted for Mitt Romney. 
[M]any professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.
According to the Kaiser Foundation, these people were intentionally screwed. Although their policies did meet the minimum ObamaCare coverage standards, The Times reports, the policies were still canceled as a way “to prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.”
If only the same thing would happen to the elite media, we might actually get somewhere in repealing a boondoggle that is victimizing millions in the working and middle class only to benefit a few thousand.

The prize for best line of questioning to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius at the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Wednesday morning must go to Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC), for pinning Sebelius down on the question of why Obamacare requires men to buy maternity coverage. Sebelius tried to squirm away–as she had done with many other questioners, but Ellmers was on her “A” game.
Ellmers’s performance was particularly commendable because she is lower in the congressional pecking order and therefore had to wait until the end, with less time to spare. She even found time, using a pointed yes-or-no question, to puncture Democrats’ favorite dodge–namely, that helped Republicans improve Medicare Part D, even though they had opposed it. (Unlike Obamacare, Medicare Part D is voluntary, as Sebelius had to admit.)
Next, Ellmers turned to the fact that Obamacare makes consumers pay more for insurance they do not need (much like being forced to buy a fancy car with all of the options, when a basic new car or used car would have been fine). 
The ensuing exchange should be studied by Republicans for future reference. This is how it’s done:

Rep. Ellmers: You also brought up the issue, when you were in Kansas [as governor and health insurance commissioner], that you fought against discriminatory issues. Now I–you know, as far as the essential health benefits [of Obamacare], correct me if I’m wrong, do men not have to buy maternity coverage? 
Sec. Sebelius: Policies will cover maternity coverage for young and healthy– 
Rep. Ellmers: Including men?
Sec. Sebelius: Under 30-year-olds will have a choice also of a catastrophic plan which has no maternity coverage.
Rep. Ellmers: The men are required to purchase– 
Sec. Sebelius: Well, an insurance policy has a series of benefits, whether you use them or not. And one of the benefits will be– 
Rep. Ellmers: And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high, because we’re forcing them to buy things they will never need. Thank you, madam chairman.
Sec. Sebelius: The individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families, yes. 
Rep. Ellmers: Single male, age 32, does not need maternity coverage. 
[Crosstalk]
Rep. Ellmers: To the best of your knowledge has a man ever delivered a baby?
Sec. Sebelius: I don’t think so.
Chair: The gentlelady’s time has expired.

Did you notice? Did you see what happened when everyone was complaining about a website? Single-payer got started in America.
Vermont is using authority granted under the Affordable Care Act to start a single-payer system. Most Americans still don't know what the phrase ""single-payer"" even means. It had little support in Congress in 2009 and Senate ""Democrats"" like Nelson and Lieberman even killed the public option. But, ACA had this sweet little provision that allowed states to set up a single-payer system and now people will see it in action. You know what that means.
As Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) opines, ""The quickest route toward a national health care program will be when individual states go forward and demonstrate that universal and non-profit health care works, and that it is the cost-effective and moral thing to do.”
Oh I know this is hard to swallow. Obama is third-way! He's dismantling the safetynet! A corporatist! He killed the public option!
Whatever else he is, Obama is a President who acts in a thoughtful, deliberate way that the chicken little headlines of the day often miss. As many predicted, ACA is already leading to the kind of transformative progressive change Obama promised. The progressive movement will be responsible for showing the nation how well single-payer works after the Vermont system goes into effect. When public and non-profit insurance becomes the national norm, we'll know where it began.

On Friday, the House voted for a resolution to keep government open but also defund ObamaCare. Within minutes, Nancy Mace, who is opposing Sen. Lindsey Graham in the GOP primary, issued a press release attacking Graham for his past criticism of the defunding strategy. In just two hours, Graham tweeted that he supported the House’s efforts to defund the unpopular health care law. Such is the power of primaries. 
I support the House-passed bill to Defund Obamacare. #SenateMustAct
— Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) September 20, 2013
As recently as July, Graham said that defunding ObamaCare was “a bridge too far for him.” Primary opponents do tend to focus a politician’s mind. 
Graham faces at least three opponents in next year’s primary contest. Normally, multiple challengers give an edge to incumbents, as opposition is split among several challengers. South Carolina, however, uses a run-off system. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the top two voter-getters face off in a run-off. Multiple challengers increase the odds that Graham falls below 50% and has to face a run-off. 
Graham is no doubt a nice man and would make a good GOP Senator from a state like Maine. His representing South Carolina, however, is a wasted opportunity for conservatives. An East Coast John McCain does a disservice to the Palmetto State. 
Graham’s tweet in support of the House action indicates he is aware of the challenge before him. Few incumbents are so disliked by the grass-roots, both in South Carolina and across the country. A run-off election, with a single conservative challenger, would ignite national interest and possibly create a wave that washes over Graham.
His tweet in support of defunding ObamaCare was a good start. He now has to follow that up over the coming weeks. "

As the first hearings on the failed implementation of Obamacare begin Thursday, with the testimony of the healthcare.gov contractors before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Democrats have already developed their strategy for blunting Republican criticism. They will a) assert that repairs are being made; b) attack critics for “politicizing” the problems; and c) demand the GOP join efforts to support the law.
Along the way, Democrats will cling mightily to the straw man upon which they relied throughout 2009-2010 during the debate over the law: namely, that if you oppose Obamacare you are opposed to providing health care to the working poor, to those with pre-existing conditions, to the temporarily unemployed. They will cover the foreseeable failure of a policy that has already hurt millions with the glory of noble intentions.
Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, previewed the Democrats’ strategy on Oct. 22, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN’s The Situation Room. Cummings made clear that his party will try to deflect criticism of Obamacare by casting it as the latest example of alleged Republican overreach on Obama administration scandals:
BLITZER: I know you must be very frustrated. Were you surprised to learn that apparently no one was really in charge of this Web site rollout, even though they had a couple years to plan for it? 
CUMMINGS: Yes, a bit surprised. But Wolf, what we’ve got to concentrate now on is making sure that the Web site works. And I’m hoping that Republicans and Democrats will see this not as a partisan issue, but as one that we have to make work for all the American people. Failure is just not an option….
Keep in mind, Republicans have spent the last few years trying to repeal it over 45 times, trying to defund it, trying to delay it. And so I have not seen a lot of effort on their part to make the law better but simply to destroy it. So that’s the kind of issue that I’m working with, Wolf, on my committee. I’ve got to make sure that we all work together to make sure that the law works for millions upon millions of Americans who need health care….
I think what I’m seeing now is the same play and the same scene all over again. We saw the chairman make strong allegations which were inaccurate with regard to Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. And only to find out that those allegations were simply not accurate and had no basis of fact. So it makes my job a little tougher. 
Note that the country has yet to learn the truth of what happened in Benghazi, Fast and Furious, and the IRS scandal. In every case, Cummings has tried to prevent oversight, not to facilitate it. He acknowledges some failures in the administration, and expresses some minimal outrage, but then tries to cast Republicans as witch-hunters rather than trying to hold the executive accountable. Expect more of the same on Obamacare."

Last night, Bill Maher ripped into the Republicans for claiming to be pro-life and anti-abortion, and yet then also opposing Plan B and HPV vaccines.
And finally, New Rule: Stop saying Republicans are waging a war on women.  It's not women they hate, it's women having sex that doesn't end with a baby popping out.  Sex in their mind is for procreation, not recreation.  The same way the G-spot is seen as just another liberal hoax that needs more study.  (audience laughter and applause)
All right, I bring this up because, besides the heroic Wendy Davis, there were two stories in the news last week dealing with teenage sex.  And just to be safe, the Vatican issued a denial.  (audience groans)  Yeah, you'll get over it.
One story was about Plan B.  That's the morning after pill that the FDA says is safer than Motrin, and which any American can now buy over the counter, just like milk and ammo.  And because it's a birth control pill, it will prevent abortions.
Now the other story was about the vaccine for HPV, which is the STD that leads to cervical cancer, and how that vaccine, since its introduction in 2006, has reduced teenage infections by 56%.
All good news, right?  Wrong!  No, over in Family Values World, things like Plan B and the HPV vaccine are bad, because they remove God's natural intended punishments for sluts who put out.  (shocked audience laughter)  It's true.
A) being saddled with a baby you don't want, or
B) stricken with a horrible disease.
You don't think that's how these people think?  Then tell me why conservatives always couch their objections to the HPV vaccine in ""parental rights"", but never complain about other state-mandated vaccines their kids have to get.  Why not throw a shit fit about the measles vaccine?  Or mumps, rubella, whooping cough, chicken pox?  Because you don't get those diseases from screwing or yodeling in the canyon.  (audience laughter turns into cheering)
They do not want a vaccine for HPV, because that's the good kind of cancer, that makes hussies think twice about going all the way.  Ron Paul — a fucking doctor! — said this vaccine, which prevents thousands of cases of a fatal disease, was ""not good medicine"".  And Michele Bachmann said it caused mental retardation.  Her source?  The New England Journal of A Lady Who Stopped Me on the Street and Told Me That.  (audience applause)
Yes, Republicans actually think this vaccine encourages girls to have sex, because now there are no consequences.  Just the way when I got my first tetanus shot, I couldn't wait to jab rusty nails into my feet!  (audience laughter)  It was a freebie!
But studies have been done on this, and girls who get the HPV shot become no more sexually active than girls who do not.  It's not like they see the needle getting stuck in and go, ""Ooh, that gives me an idea!""  (audience laughter)
They already have the idea.  One in three 16-year-olds in America are having intercourse.  To deny them access to the vaccine or Plan B as a means of preventing them from doing it, is like not giving them an umbrella so it won't rain.  (audience applause)
And Plan B, again, is not an abortion pill.  Quite the opposite.  It's a dose of hormones that prevents ovulation.  You know, ovulation, when a tramp's ovaries release an egg.  (audience laughter)  So there is no egg for the sperm to fertilize.  So ""unborn life"" doesn't enter into it.  If you have a problem with it, it's because you and your invisible friend just don't like people having sex.
If Republicans were really pro-life, they'd endorse making Plan B free to women everywhere.  Of course, plenty of ministers' daughters are going to be using Plan B too.  And good.  Why should there be shame if on one night, a curious teenager loses herself in a moment of passion and says, ""OK, you can stick it in, but just for a minute.""  Not knowing that a 16-year-old boy couldn't last a minute if he tried!  (wild audience laughter and applause)

Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin condemned left-wing women’s groups Friday for ignoring MSNBC host Martin Bashir suggestion that former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin deserved an inhuman punishment once used against slaves which includes defecation in one’s mouth and urination in victims’ eyes and mouth.
After letting his listeners know that Bashir said on his MSNBC show that Palin deserved this “dose of discipline” a Jamaican slave master leveled on his slaves, Levin said Bashir likely had delivered the “most disgraceful rant” yet against Palin. 
“Hey tough guy. You like picking on women? You like picking on a mother and a grandmother?” Levin said to Bashir. “You strike me as not tough at all, if you get my drift.” 
Levin then blasted the “pathetic little carbon footprint called MSNBC” for being so “offended with Palin” comparing the federal debt to slavery that they would allow such rants. He said the network should be called the “animal channel” or the “comedy channel.” 
Levin said Palin was exactly right to compare the federal debt to slavery and nothing was offensive about it, since she was not making a comparison to chattel slavery. 
Levin then said “his people,” the “Jewish people,” were slaves, and he did not for one minute think Palin’s comparison was made to “diminish Jewish people or the early days of the nation.”
Levin then called out women’s group like the National Organization for Women (NOW) for “never” coming to the defense of conservative women like Palin. 
Levin said these groups never defend conservative women from misogyny, even when it takes a turn towards the vile and filthy, because “they are not feminist groups. They are left-wing groups. They don’t care about women. They care about left-wing women.”
He said groups like NOW would “worship” Palin if she were a left-wing politician.

Deborah posted the what follows below the fold in the Kingwood Area Democrats group. She is a member of the age group that the right wing has convinced that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is bad for them. Deborah has been fighting an uphill battle by writing op-eds in the local papers and speaking to whomever she could to enlighten them on Obamacare. She went to a financial planning seminar a few days ago and she recounts the following, below the fold.




The financial planner told a group of older voting Conservatives that Obamacare was good for their financial well-being. Ironically, a commenter on the post in the same age bracket had the same experience with another group. Now that reality has set in, money managers are advising baby boomers appropriately.
On Monday the New York Times had an excellent article titled “In New Health Law, a Bridge to Medicare.” It details the benefits for those retiring before they qualify for Medicare and the benefits for Americans with pre-existing conditions that had to stay on their jobs lest they would be left without health care. The following paragraphs from the article are prescient.

THE sweeping federal health care law making its major public debut next month was meant for people like Juanita Stonebraker, 63, from Oakland, Md., who retired from her job in a hospital billing office a year and a half ago.
She was able to continue her health insurance coverage from the hospital for a time, but when she tried to find an individual policy on her own, none of the insurers she contacted would cover her because she was diabetic.
“I didn’t even get to tell them about the heart attack,” said Ms. Stonebraker, who has been without health insurance since July. She is a little over a year away from qualifying for Medicare, the federal insurance program for people 65 and older. She now worries a recent hospitalization will leave her several thousand dollars in debt.
Under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, insurers must now offer coverage to people like Ms. Stonebraker, and they will not be able to set the premiums they charge on the basis of someone’s health. Starting Oct. 1, she and millions of other Americans are expected to be able to buy one of the plans available through newly created online state marketplaces, or exchanges, for coverage that begins in 2014. For those with low incomes, subsidies are available to help pay premiums.

Does anyone know anyone over 50 without some pre-existing condition that an insurance company would not have used to deny coverage entirely or red-lined some pre-existing ailment from coverage?
At this point it is unnecessary to attempt to have any type of argument with Obamacare naysayers. This is the time for the enlightened to help relatives, neighbors and friends to navigate their health insurance head winds. One should encourage them to discuss their medical situation and where applicable hold their hands to assist in getting the coverage they need. One should encourage them to get their information from healthcare.gov and not from political radicals maligning the law.
In a state like Texas where more than 25 percent of the population is uninsured, every fourth person you are in contact with is likely uninsured and a fall or accident away from a bankruptcy inducing medical bill. Many of the uninsured are unaware that Obamacare is the law of the land and are unaware of the benefits that will materially make their lives better.
Given that when Americans are provided with the individual benefits of Obamacare they love it, one should personalize the way it is explained with the specific benefits one's relative, neighbor, or friend's need in such a manner that the benefits are stressed and not the politics. This will ultimately prevent that carnal resistance that can cause someone to make decisions against their own interest to save face.
Many part time workers will face employers like Trader Joe’s who may find it more economical to send those employees to state health insurance exchanges. While many corporations will blame Obamacare, over the years corporations have been offloading health care costs. One should explain that as more and more employees go to the exchanges the exchanges become more economical. Moreover not being tethered to the employer’s health care plan allows one to make decisions based on work satisfaction and not the requirement for health care.
Dissuade those opting for paying the penalty instead of premiums by reminding them that the new policies cover screenings at no additional charge. After all, many of the uninsured have been without insurance for many years and in need of physicals and screenings.
As Obamacare becomes more and more real to Americans, they won’t necessarily claim to like it. However, they will not want to give it up for an alternative that does not exist. They won’t leave it for financial insecurity. Henceforth that is the biggest fear of the Republicans that oppose the bill. Americans will see Republicans as a liability to their well-being if they continue to disparage a law they come to see as beneficial.

If Ayn Rand is, in the words of Robert Reich, ""the philosophical guru of the modern Republican Party,"" then the billionaire, Rand-worshipping Koch brothers are its paymasters. Now they've launched a new campaign of lies, aiming their pocketbook at Obamacare, or, more accurately, at those who stand to benefit from its reforms. You know, small, ""special-interest"" groups like, say: women (and the people who love them), young people between the ages of 19 and 26, as well as others (and their affected families) who can't get coverage at work, or lose coverage when they lose their job, or can't get coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Does that sound to you like just about all of us at one point in our lives? Yeah, me too.
The Koch brothers' campaign is merely part of a larger, truly unprecedented Republican strategy to sabotage the entire health care law passed in 2009 by a Democratic House and Senate and signed by President Obama.
The Republicans need the law to fail because its success will only further cement the reality that government regulations can and do bring tangible benefits to people. In other words, the law's success will translate into further defeats for their party and for their extreme anti-government ideology. This has been the Republican thinking on health care reform for 20 years. Will the Koch/Republican campaign succeed? Not if we can help it.
These thoughts were on my mind as I had a conversation with a physician I know, an obstetrician-gynecologist. The physician mentioned a patient who asked if the implementation of Obamacare would alter her relationship with her doctor or the practice in general. The patient was quite concerned, unsurprisingly, as change can be unsettling—especially change relating to one's health care.
The physician put the patient at ease, explaining that the patient-doctor relationship would not change, that she'd be able to continue seeing her current doctor. On the other hand, the Koch brothers' ad includes ""Julie"" asking: ""If we can’t pick our own doctor, how do I know our family is going to get the care they need?"" Of course, there's nothing in the health care legislation that reduces a patient's ability to choose his or her own doctor.
For the rest of the conversation, please follow me beyond the fold.


The physician also informed her patient that, not only wouldn't their relationship change, the new law has some very specific benefits relating to her gynecologic and obstetrical care that have already taken effect. First, insurers are now mandated to cover contraceptive care with no patient co-pays. Unless one works for a house of worship (they were exempted under a compromise plan announced in February), one is guaranteed this coverage. Second, insurers must now fully cover breast pumps for nursing mothers (the law requires coverage for the cost of renting a pump, although many insurers decided also to cover the cost of purchase as well).
In other words, Obamacare makes it easier for a woman to control when she will become a mother, and easier for her to feed her children in a way of her choosing, despite the obstacles work and life may throw in the way. Two pretty important benefits, among many others.
This is the kind of information that can counter the lies put forth by the Koch brothers. Women and all of us deserve the truth.

Dana Bash of CNN reported Wednesday evening that all of the Democratic Senators facing re-election in 2014 would back a “new” proposal to delay the Obamacare enrollment deadline–not really “new,” since Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) already said he would propose legislation to delay the individual mandate, and House Republicans passed a bill in late September to avoid a government shutdown if the mandate were delayed.
new: senior dem source tells me to expect every sen dem running in 2014 to back @JeanneShaheen proposal to delay #ACA enrollment deadline
— Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 23, 2013
The House proposal failed in the Senate, 54-46, on a party-line vote. Every single Democrat voted against the proposed delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, including those up for re-election in 2014, including red-state Democrats–all of them. If just five of them had shifted, the shutdown would have been avoided and the delay would have been passed–to face Obama’s veto, but the point would have been made.
Furthermore, there are sixteen Democrats facing re-election in the Senate, almost enough to override the president’s veto. If just a few more Democrats–perhaps the five planning to retire–had switched to back a delay that even the White House is said to be considering in one form or another, then Obama’s veto would not have been a threat. The disastrous Obamacare rollout, and the shutdown, would not have happened.
As I wrote on Sep. 23, that solution was “Win-win. Therefore unlikely.” But it should have happened, if the media had been more interested in the substance of the issue rather than whether Obama would win or lose. Instead, they helped Democrats and the media label the GOP as terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, “Gremlins” (my favorite) and suicide bombers–while some Republicans joined in the insults.
When the polls landed, Democrats became the “terrorists, hostage-takers, kidnappers, arsonists, and suicide bombers,” pressing their perceived advantage to demand the reversal of the budget sequester–at least until their allies in the media quietly warned them not to squander their victory. Now that some Democrats have embraced what Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and–yes–John Boehner fought for, no one is calling them nasty names.
What’s done is done–and Republicans will have to find a way back from what was, in the end, a very real political loss. But let it be noted, along the way, that the very same Democrats who will now be lining up to support a delay in the enrollment deadline or individual mandate were proud that they “never folded” in the debate just a few weeks ago. They had their chance to protect Americans. They protected Obama instead."

The left-wing Politico deserves credit for reporting what much of the media will not: the fallout yet to come from the rolling ObamaCare debacle. Politico covers the death spiral, sticker shock, and more. Conspicuously missing in Politico’s analysis, though, is the Obama administration’s own prediction that ObamaCare will potentially result in tens of millions of employer-based health plan cancellations. 
Yes, you read that correctly; the Obama administration itself predicted in 2010 that “a majority of group health plans will have lost their grandfather status by the end 2013.” …
The DOJ cites the June 17, 2010, edition of the Federal Register, which acknowledges that within the first year of Obamacare’s employer mandate, the insurance plans offered by many employers will be canceled because their policies will not be grandfathered under the administration’s regulations. 
“The Departments’ mid-range estimate is that 66 percent of small-employer plans and 45 percent of large-employer plans will relinquish their grandfather status by the end of 2013,” the Register says. “The low-end estimates are for 49 percent and 34 percent of small and large-employer plans, respectively, to have relinquished grandfather status, and the high-end estimates are 80 percent and 64 percent, respectively.”
In other words, the Obama administration itself expects that the misery currently roiling the individual market is going to happen to the employer-based or group plan market. If you like your employer-based insurance, there is a better chance than not that you are going to lose it. 
So all this talk from Democrats, the media, and the White House that the cancelation fallout will be restricted to just 5% of the public simply isn’t true. 
Millions of employer-based plans will be canceled because they do not meet the government’s standards for minimum coverage, which means that whatever alternative coverage the insurance provider offers will be more expensive. Some employers might choose to eat all of that extra cost. But many will either pass the cost on to their employees or choose not to provide insurance. 
Millions, then, will not only get herded into the ObamaCare exchanges; they will also lose the benefit of their employer sharing the cost of their health insurance premiums.
The White House knows this. The Democrats know this. The media know this. But they also know that reporting on this possibility will justifiably spook the 95% who think they are safe — and that would almost certainly mean the end of ObamaCare.

Some are going to see this title and say ""that is wild hyperbole"".    But, now that we have years of empirical statistical data to review, the point is not too far off.   Over the last seven years, the Infant Mortality Rate has dropped significantly, a true positive for the US.. and something we should all be proud of.
http://www.nytimes.com/...
The states with the steepest declines in infant deaths — Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina — have long been plagued with some of the nation’s highest infant mortality rates, Dr. MacDorman added. In all four states the rate dropped by more than 20 percent from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which state data are available. The District of Columbia, which has expanded a home-visit program for poor pregnant women and stepped up other efforts to keep mothers and their babies healthy, saw the biggest drop: from 14.05 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 7.86 in 2010.
This, in the end, is a real accomplishment - wanted children who are properly cared for and a decreased infant mortality rate.  A plus for all of us.   But state after state, Republicans are apparently telling us that they would prefer the OLD infant mortality rate, the one that happens with diminished pre-natal care.
http://floridaindependent.com/...
According to the “End of Session” report from the Florida House of Representatives released this week, Florida’s Healthy Start Coalitions lost $5.2 million dollars in state funding this year. Local Healthy Start coalitions provide high-quality prenatal care services for at-risk mothers and health care services for children in their communities.
This kind of pattern thinking gives us these results:  with a lower standard of care, you end up with an increased rate of infant mortality, children who die at birth or in the first twelve months of life.   Those in poverty who proceed with having a child without proper prenatal care have an increased risk of birth defects and illness, which proper prenatal care can help resolve.   Finally, women with low access to prenatal care may feel pushed to have an abortion, because they have neither the money or resources to provide for a proper pregnancy.   So, I ask Republicans:  Why have you decided that having babies (those from birth to 12 months) die at a higher rate is good?  Because good prenatal and post-birth care, which you are cutting does exactly that.   Last I checked, that was called infanticide.   And in the grand scheme of things, it makes me sick.



Sometimes, we overlook the trees and all we see is the forest.   A successful society works to help make sure that the people are well cared for, avoid illness, and have access to good medicine and good advice.   But that's not always the case, at least not to Republicans.
States like Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana have all made moves to cut prenatal care, and at the same time, they move to cut funding to planned parenthood, of course.   In their mind, it means fewer abortions.  In reality, it means far more unwanted pregnancies, and a raise in rates of infant mortality.
http://www.guttmacher.org/...
One in 10 women said that they had switched to a less expensive provider of contraceptive services. This increased demand for lower-cost services was mirrored in the survey responses from family planning providers. Two-thirds of the family planning centers surveyed noted an increase in the number of clients seeking services between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 (see chart, page 10). Importantly, the vast majority of providers surveyed said they had seen an increase in the number of clients who are poor or low income and, therefore, eligible for free or reduced-fee care from providers receiving any subsidy from the federal Title X program.
More than half the providers reported significant service delivery challenges in meeting clients' needs. Most often, they reported staff layoffs or a hiring freeze during 2009. Many also said that they had been forced to reduce the number of contraceptive methods they are able to offer; more expensive methods such as the IUD, the implant, the patch and some brand-name oral contraceptives were the most likely to be cut. One in four providers said that waiting times had increased, typically doubling from less than a week to about two weeks.

As women have less and less access to effective birthcontrol, the rate of potential unwanted pregnancy goes up.  
The republicans counter this claim with:  ""Then don't have sex"".  My response:  OK, let us see how long you men who pass these laws can go without sex.  We'll have a Jerry Seinfield like competition and check it out.
The sad fact is, this move to cut access to early care and family planning doesn't cut abortion as much as it increases infant mortality - and which is more negative to you?
In general, Owens said, many pregnant women don't realize the importance of getting their own medical problems treated.
""We know that the way we get the best pregnancy is to have a healthy mom before mom and baby are together,"" she said.

Birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States. Not all are preventable, but a mother can reduce risk by keeping her own health under control by eliminating smoking, drinking and illegal drugs.
The same is true for premature births, another leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. The March of Dimes recently released its Premature Birth Report Card and gave failing grades to Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Mississippi has the largest premature birth rate based on the 2011 national statistics used in the report.

http://www.cnn.com/...
With conservative states leading the way in rates of birth defects and premature births.   Not all birth defects can be prevented, but many, say the March of Dimes as well as the CDC, can be prevented through good prenatal care, proper nutrition, access to routine checkups.. which includes health of the mother, blood pressure control, etc.   These are common things for those with insurance and care, but not for the poor.  
So, let's be blunt.. the decrease in prenatal care means a rise in infant mortality and an increase in children born with preventable birth defects because of lack of care.
The March of Dimes speaks to exactly how effective good pre-natal care is.
http://www.pcrm.org/...
The medical costs of care for children with disabilities resulting from birth defects have been estimated to exceed $1.4 billion annually.
While some types of birth defects have decreased, mainly through preventive methods, many have increased. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 38 types of birth defects occurring over the period 1979-89, 27 had increased, including several cardiac defects, chromosomal defects such as trisomy 18, and fetal alcohol syndrome; nine had remained the same; and only two had decreased.

That's OK, though, because Republicans will want to fund support for all the children of disabilities born because of bad prenatal care, and they will provide support for women who lose their child in the first year, right?
Don't worry, Republican governors have got that.
2. A program to help adults with disabilities live independently faces an enrollment freeze in the new budget, which will leave nearly 17,000 men and women throughout the state without vital resources over the next two years. Family Care helps provide a wide range of services such as in-home care, supported living communities, meal delivery, and job training to help keep more than 31,000 people integrated with their communities; waiting lists for private resources like housing can be well over a decade. Cutting off enrollment in Family Care is a message from Scott Walker to men and women already disproportionately affected by poverty and discrimination that in his eyes they’re less than human.
http://www.alternet.org/...
So, with more unwanted pregnancies, a higher infant mortality, and an increase in preventable birth defects, I want to know: when did Republicans become the party that likes any of these things?   Because rooting for increases in infant mortality and birth defects is so abhorrent to me, I cannot fathom the logic.
Sorry Republicans.  I prefer babies who breath and live healthy, long lives.   That's why I favor prenatal care support.    Please, advocate for me that you want more children to die after birth, as long as they aren't aborted.   Because it would be an honest assessment of how this will turn out.

A new poll released by the Washington Post/ABC News reports very bad news for Obama. The President has hit record disapproval rating (56% among RVs, 55% among adults) and his Affordable Care Act is tanking in the public’s opinion. 
Not only does the public disapprove of Obama’s job performance, more than half do not like him. Fifty-two percent say they have an unfavorable image of the President. To drive that home, the three metrics used to measure Obama’s “leadership and empathy” are all in the red.  
Half or more now say he is not a strong leader, does not understand the problems of “people like you,” and is not honest and trustworthy. Perceptions of the president as a strong leader have dropped 15 points since January, and over the past year the percentage of registered voters who say he is not honest and trustworthy has increased 12 points.
These ratings carry over to opinions on Obamacare. Fifty-six percent say Obama is not a good manager and this is evident when looking at opinions about his health care program specifically. Almost two-thirds (63%) disapprove of of the program’s roll out and 57% straight up oppose the Affordable Healthcare Act, a 10% jump up from last month. The lynchpin of Obama’s program, the mandate to purchase insurance also performs quite poorly with two thirds (65%) opposing it. 
Polls are considered a snapshot in time, so there is no telling if America’s sour outlook on Obama and Obamacare will stick. Obama has promised to “re-brand” his health care program and it remains to be seen if the country will give him a second chance. Certainly the unintended consequences or rather, the particulars of the law which were concealed from the public, are not popular and indicate that if the public had “read the law before they passed it” it might not have ever been approved.

Health care wonks are crowing about a “November surge” in enrollment. Will the November surge will be able to make up for the October purge, i.e. the millions who were dropped from existing plans because of Obamacare’s new minimum standards for coverage? In California, there is reason to think it may not.
In a piece posted at Wonkblog Friday, author Sarah Kliff introduced the term  “November surge” into the discussion of enrollment figures. According to Kliff, the uptick in enrollment, especially in California, is reason for optimism:
Some state-based marketplaces had a pretty smooth launch, and are seeing the pace of enrollment speed up daily. California has lead [led] the bunch; the state’s enrollments have grownsteadily in November and now account for nearly a full third of allhealth law sign-ups. The state has had its strongest two weeks ofenrollment this month.
The enrollment surge in California, and the idea that it was part of a broader pattern, was first reported by LA Times health writer Noam Levey a week ago. Levey’s piece was widely quoted, including by Sarah Kliff, but his claims did not stand up to much scrutiny. For instance, Levey claimed that Kentucky was “outpacing” its enrollment estimates. A spokesperson for the state says no such estimates exist. 
Both Levey and Kliff fail to ask the most important question. How soon will current enrollment trends balance out the number of people who have been dropped from their insurance as a result of Obamacare grandfathering regulations? In other words, can a November surge make up for the October purge?
Health insurance expert Bob Laszewski suggests California has a long way to go before the net enrollment shows a gain. He lays out the figures in a post published Monday:
Laszewski concludes “Looking at these numbers, if they don’t have well more than 500,000people signed up by December 31, I would have to think the number ofuninsured in California would have grown.”
Any fair accounting of the enrollment figures needs to keep in mind the number of people who–contrary to the President’s oft-repeated promise–have been kicked off plans they had. In California the enrollment figures for November have improved but they are still a long way from bringing the state back to where it was before the cancellation notices went out."

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Speaker John Boehner



House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Speaker John Boehner

Yes, the Republican proposal for $40 billion in food stamp cuts over the next 10 years would have horrific effects on millions of people, the dirty hippies over at the Congressional Budget Office confirm:
According to the CBO, 1.7 million people would be forced off the rolls in the coming year if the state waivers are repealed as proposed by Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Another 2.1 million would be dropped in 2014 as a result of the tighter eligibility rules backed by the GOP.
In both cases, the impact would decline as the economy improves and more jobs become available. But on average, CBO estimates that a total of 2.8 million people would lose their benefits over the next decade, and another 850,000 households will see an average reduction of about $90 a month in benefits.

That's 1.7 million people going hungry or being forced onto severely restricted diets now, with millions more to come. A $90 cut in the groceries a family can buy in a month is also a Big F'ing Deal, especially for a family that's already pinching every penny to get enough to eat. Taking $90 out of a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program allotment that already only lasts most families two and a half weeks is in itself cruel—and, from the most coldly financial perspective, shortsighted, since forcing people to eat more cheaply means increased risk of diabetes and other chronic conditions that will raise health care costs for the nation.
But this is what Eric Cantor and the starvation caucus of his party want. And even if they can't actually get $40 billion in cuts through the Senate or signed by the president, the farm bill—which nutrition assistance is usually part of and which House Speaker John Boehner isn't sending to conference with the Senate until these cuts get a vote—sure makes a nice hostage to take in the effort to force deeper cuts than either the Senate or the president would want to make.
Wed Sep 18, 2013 at 11:44 AM PT (Chris Bowers): Please send an email to your member of the House of Representatives, telling him or her to oppose all cuts to food stamps.

Texas Governor Rick Perry has been one of the biggest obstructionists to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)  in Texas along with the entire Republican Party nationally. Inasmuch as Texas is the state with the highest rate of uninsured citizens he refused Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid. For those with pre-existing condition in Texas who were either in the high priced high risk Texas insurance pool or were uninsured because of the cost of these high risk pools, Obamacare comes to the rescue even here in Texas.
My wife has Lupus, a pre-existing condition. As a small business owner I had a group plan with a professional engineering organization. After being extorted with rates that effectively cost us north of $20 thousand a year over a decade ago I migrated to a high deductible catastrophic policy for my daughter and myself, an inexpensive student policy for my daughter while in college, and the Texas High Risk pool for my wife. It was expensive but less than the  previous policy. Over the long run it is evident that this would become unsustainable as all these policies increased in value at a much faster rate than inflation.
Then came Obamacare.  Obamacare means that effective October 1st, once again my wife, my daughter (while still in college and less than 26 years old), and me will be once again on the same policy at an affordable price. I already checked pricing and they are less expensive, reasonable, and provide much better coverage.
The real reason for this post however is the hypocrisy of the Republican Party in Texas. Republicans run Texas, not because it is a Red State but because it is the state with the worst voter participation. They run all departments. They run all agencies including the high risk pool. Today my wife received the following letter.

Important to note is that the letter correctly echoes the benefits of Obamacare for the millions in Texas and the United States with preexisting conditions. It correctly states that someone with a preexisting condition can no longer be denied coverage. It states forcefully (with an underline) that everyone is guaranteed the same rate given one’s age. It also correctly states that many will qualify for subsidies.
The letter even goes further in promoting Obamacare. It correctly states that there are no more lifetime maximums (in other words insurance companies cannot stop paying up to some maximum; bankruptcies be gone). It correctly  states that 100% coverage for preventative care is provided, and all policies now cover doctor visits hospitalization, and prescriptions. In other words charlatans can no longer sell worthless policies. Most importantly, the letter sends Texans to the correct website that will provide them accurate information instead of all the lies and misinformation provided in an orchestrated manner by the Republican Party. The misinformation and lies will directly cause the unnecessary deaths of many, mostly their own constituents and base.
This letter from a Texas agency is the best justification for Obamacare. This Texas government agency placed the wellbeing of Texans over politics.

JoAnn Smith, a 60-year-old Florida woman, is making headlines as the latest Obamacare success story. Smith told NBC News that she ""just instantly burst into tears"" when she was able yesterday to sign up for a $3.19 a month health insurance policy through Obamacare.
Smith described the low-cost of her federally-subsidized plan as ""totally mind-blowing"" and praised the Obamacare call center agent who assisted her sign-up as ""the most loveliest of helpers.""
Previously, the aging Smith had been uninsured. The company for which Smith is a medical transcriptionist does not offer coverage to its employees.
""They took a vote at the company and people wanted more money in their pockets,"" Smith was reported as saying. ""I have had four paycuts in one year.""
Smith's new, highly affordable Obamacare policy will cover her household, including her unemployed husband Eric, age 56.
Republicans who are praying for the failure of Obamacare do not want stories like the one told by JoAnn Smith to get out, but Smith's Obamacare success story bodes well for Democrats running for re-election in 2014.
Smith had been trying to sign up for health insurance for the past two months, but Obamacare's rocky rollout and website glitches had prevented her from doing so successfully.
Smith expressed continued shock that after months of difficulty, Obamacare's sign-up process is now working well enough that her application 'took seconds to complete' according to NBC. Smith now only has to confirm payment with her new insurer:

""I am kind of afraid to call them because I feel like it's a trick. I am afraid I will call and they will say 'JoAnn who?'""

Obamacare backers aim for the law to improve the quality of healthcare for Americans by:

Providing insurance federally through healthcare.gov
Providing insurance through state-based website exchanges
Providing coverage by increasing the availability of Medicaid
Eliminating insurance denials or extra charges based on gender or pre-existing health status
Eliminating junk insurance policies and instead setting national standard for high quality coverage

Those new national standards include requirements that policies always cover prescriptions, hospitalizations, and emergency room care. The standards have led insurers to cancel the junk policies of Americans whose previous insurance did not include these benefits, deemed essential by Obamacare, rather add the benefits to those plans.
Those cancellations combined with rollout glitches led to weeks of bad press for Obamacare. Success stories like that of JoAnn Smith might indicate that many Americans will instead find cheaper coverage through Obamacare, and that the health overhaul's worst days have passed.

Yesterday I received a rebate check from my insurance company. This rebate came about because of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that specifically forces health insurance companies to spend no more than 20 percent on expenses not attributable to health care. No longer are they allowed to take your premiums and convert it to profits for shareholders, salaries for executives, and the purchase of politicians.
The Republican Party has been successful in misinforming and lying about Obamacare. This is likely one of the most immoral actions giving that slowing implementation and in the case of many Republican governors not accepting full implementation, is tantamount to the murder of American citizens with the weapon of knowing neglect.
Yesterday morning MSNBC Chuck Todd assessed that the Obama Presidency using the Republican moniker of Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act, while cute, was stupid. Todd vastly underestimates the success of the Republicans in promoting that name so much so that most Americans immediately identify with the Obamacare as opposed to the Affordable Care Act.
Just before the elections in 2012 I interviewed two intelligent upwardly mobile middle-class women in Austin, Texas. When asked about the Affordable Care Act they were completely oblivious to it. When told it was Obamacare they immediately knew what I was talking about and said they did not know it by that name. Check out that video here. It is probative.
The Obama administration has done a poor job of promoting the Affordable Care Act. The media has failed to effectively call out the lies on the Republican side thus given these lies plausibility and mental metastases. There is a lot of good news in states where politicians have made the concerted effort to support its citizens.
As people get rebates from insurance overcharges, as exchanges open that afford individuals affordable rates, and as states that have the best interests of their citizens expand Medicaid, many will see the benefits of having a healthier, humane and moral health care system. It is incumbent upon those on the right side of history to not allow those who would put corporate interest and greed over humanity to go unpunished for the sabotage they have effected on the wellbeing of the poor and the working middle class.

Last week, Vanity Fair ran a devastating and brilliant piece ripping apart the Republican lies (yes, they called them lies) about Obamacare. Kurt Eichenwald, the contributing editor who wrote the piece, promised in it that this week he would be coming back with another one on the truth about Obamacare.
And boy, did he. Here is part 2!
This one isn't the laugh riot of last week, because as Eichenwald makes clear, defanging lies is a lot easier and a lot more amusing than explaining truths. But what he hass written is the most comprehensive, clearest and impossible to dispute detailing of Obamacare that I have ever seen. If you have a tea-partier or Republican in your family, hand them the piece and give them some knowledge. More below...


What is so compelling about the new piece is it is not a bunch of the statements we already know on the benefits, like no pre-existing condition restrictions, no insurance caps, etc. Instead, Eichenwald goes in a completely different direction.
He starts off with a lament that I think we don't express enough: That talking about the life-saving benefits for the uninsured seems to be an insignificant issue for too many Americans.
Normally, I would start this discussion by providing chapter-and-verse details about the 47 million men, women, and children who now have the opportunity to obtain health insurance, to live longer and healthier lives, to avoid needless bankruptcies. But, in what to me is one of the saddest developments in our nation’s history, that reality is irrelevant to ardent Obamacare opponents....These days, I have to start by answering the question “What’s in it for me?”
And answer he does. He begins with the clearest of points that too often is ignored: the uninsured get health care, whether they have insurance or not.
This is the fundamental issue that too many people do not understand. There seems to be this belief among some that those who are uninsured simply go off and die somewhere, thus having no impact on the medical-care-delivery system in the United States. But the opposite is true—the uninsured have some of the most dramatic effects of any group on our nation’s health-care system...In fact, the uninsured affect the finances, quality of care, and availability of medical assistance to every person in a community, regardless of their insurance status.
Then, he presents the most amazing numbers I've seen in this debate: The PRECISE amount the uninsured are costing those with insurance. He begins with the national average (he gives for two years, I'll use the 2010 estimates.) That amount: $1,502. That is not the premium - that is the EXTRA premium that the insured are paying to compensate for the bills the uninsured are unable to pay.
Even more fun, the piece then shows that the highest amount in extra premium is being paid by, you guessed it, the states that are the biggest opponents of Obamacare:
It is the citizens of states most opposed to Obamacare and who are refusing expansions of Medicaid who are taking the biggest shellacking: Texas residents are paying $2,786 more in premiums for family policies provided through employers. Montana, $2,190. Alaska, $2,248. Idaho, $2,152. North Carolina, $1,828.
I've already started reciting those numbers to some friends who have bought into the Republican lies. Their only response is ""splutter.""
Then Eichenwald points out something I never knew. Those communities with the highest numbers of uninsured have the lowest quality of care, not just for the uninsured, but for the insured as well.
Follow the logic. Hospitals don’t have poverty wards; if a patient comes in the door in bad shape, they don’t do a wallet biopsy before deciding what care that person should receive—everyone at a hospital receives the same quality. But if a community has a higher number of uninsured, that means the latest and greatest technology and treatments will drive up the amounts of unreimbursed care. In essence, hospitals that provide the best, most modern, and most expensive treatments in an area with lots of uninsured will be forced to pass unsustainable amounts of cost to their prices. Insurance companies won’t pay it, local governments won’t finance it, and the hospitals will go out of business. The only option then? Don’t provide the top-quality care to anyone—insured or not.
Eichenwald then immediately acknowledges that people might not believe the logic, and so cites multiple studies proving he's right.
It is only after this lengthy description of medical economics that Eichenwald returns to the benefits to the uninsured.
With the “what’s in it for me” question regarding the benefits of covering the uninsured, now let’s go to the price they pay for being without health insurance. This one is as simple as screaming “death panels”: the uninsured die. As the Texas health-care task force reports: ""Overall, the uninsured receive less preventive care, are diagnosed at more advanced stages of disease, and once diagnosed, receive less therapeutic care than do the insured. Thus, lack of adequate insurance leads to premature death."" Hopefully, those words are easy enough for everyone to understand. If Republicans truly are dedicated to the sanctity of life, they should be the first ones on the front lines trying to get policies for the uninsured.
This is as much as I can quote and still stay within fair use. But it is a long, long article loaded with powerful facts, figures and arguments. Before you have another arguments with the deluded, just print it out and hand it to them. It was exhilarating to read!

Last night, Bill Maher ripped into the Republicans for claiming to be pro-life and anti-abortion, and yet then also opposing Plan B and HPV vaccines.
And finally, New Rule: Stop saying Republicans are waging a war on women.  It's not women they hate, it's women having sex that doesn't end with a baby popping out.  Sex in their mind is for procreation, not recreation.  The same way the G-spot is seen as just another liberal hoax that needs more study.  (audience laughter and applause)
All right, I bring this up because, besides the heroic Wendy Davis, there were two stories in the news last week dealing with teenage sex.  And just to be safe, the Vatican issued a denial.  (audience groans)  Yeah, you'll get over it.
One story was about Plan B.  That's the morning after pill that the FDA says is safer than Motrin, and which any American can now buy over the counter, just like milk and ammo.  And because it's a birth control pill, it will prevent abortions.
Now the other story was about the vaccine for HPV, which is the STD that leads to cervical cancer, and how that vaccine, since its introduction in 2006, has reduced teenage infections by 56%.
All good news, right?  Wrong!  No, over in Family Values World, things like Plan B and the HPV vaccine are bad, because they remove God's natural intended punishments for sluts who put out.  (shocked audience laughter)  It's true.
A) being saddled with a baby you don't want, or
B) stricken with a horrible disease.
You don't think that's how these people think?  Then tell me why conservatives always couch their objections to the HPV vaccine in ""parental rights"", but never complain about other state-mandated vaccines their kids have to get.  Why not throw a shit fit about the measles vaccine?  Or mumps, rubella, whooping cough, chicken pox?  Because you don't get those diseases from screwing or yodeling in the canyon.  (audience laughter turns into cheering)
They do not want a vaccine for HPV, because that's the good kind of cancer, that makes hussies think twice about going all the way.  Ron Paul — a fucking doctor! — said this vaccine, which prevents thousands of cases of a fatal disease, was ""not good medicine"".  And Michele Bachmann said it caused mental retardation.  Her source?  The New England Journal of A Lady Who Stopped Me on the Street and Told Me That.  (audience applause)
Yes, Republicans actually think this vaccine encourages girls to have sex, because now there are no consequences.  Just the way when I got my first tetanus shot, I couldn't wait to jab rusty nails into my feet!  (audience laughter)  It was a freebie!
But studies have been done on this, and girls who get the HPV shot become no more sexually active than girls who do not.  It's not like they see the needle getting stuck in and go, ""Ooh, that gives me an idea!""  (audience laughter)
They already have the idea.  One in three 16-year-olds in America are having intercourse.  To deny them access to the vaccine or Plan B as a means of preventing them from doing it, is like not giving them an umbrella so it won't rain.  (audience applause)
And Plan B, again, is not an abortion pill.  Quite the opposite.  It's a dose of hormones that prevents ovulation.  You know, ovulation, when a tramp's ovaries release an egg.  (audience laughter)  So there is no egg for the sperm to fertilize.  So ""unborn life"" doesn't enter into it.  If you have a problem with it, it's because you and your invisible friend just don't like people having sex.
If Republicans were really pro-life, they'd endorse making Plan B free to women everywhere.  Of course, plenty of ministers' daughters are going to be using Plan B too.  And good.  Why should there be shame if on one night, a curious teenager loses herself in a moment of passion and says, ""OK, you can stick it in, but just for a minute.""  Not knowing that a 16-year-old boy couldn't last a minute if he tried!  (wild audience laughter and applause)

Half of the people who have signed up for Obamacare in 17 states have not activated their health insurance plans by making their first premium payment, a trend that threatens to further embarrass and frustrate President Barack Obama and the highly unpopular Obamacare program. 
Health insurance plans purchased through Obamacare only kick in once a customer pays their first month’s premium. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that “only about half of enrollees billed for plans offered by more than 100 insurers in 17 states had paid their first month’s premium,” according to Benaissance chief strategy officer Mark Waterstraat, whose firm serves as a third-party billing company for insurers. Another insurer, Scott & White Health Plan, told the Journal that only 35% of its enrollees have paid for the plans they applied for. 
The Obama administration remains far behind its 7 million enrollment target but has recently celebrated what it calls two million Obamacare “enrollments.” Yet that figure merely reflects the number of applications submitted, not the number of paying customers who have turned on their plans by actually paying for coverage. Whether insurers in the other 33 states are experiencing nonpayment rates in the 35% to 50% range is presently unknown. If those rates extended nationally, they would mean the Obama administration’s claim that it has enrolled two million people in Obamacare would plunge to just 700,000 to one million. 
Even progressive groups like the left-leaning journalism group ProPublica say the emergence of an Obamacare nonpayment gap raises “the prospect that actual enrollment will be far lower than the figures HHS [Health and Human Services] is releasing.” 
Part of the problem may be the costs of the plans offered through Obamacare. A recent USA Today analysis found that over half of all counties in the 34 states on the federal HealthCare.gov exchange “lack even a bronze plan that’s affordable by the government’s own definition.”
“There is also a lot of worrying going on over people making payments,” industry consultant Robert Laszewski told ProPublica. 
Experts say that first-time insurance buyers may not fully understand the duties and responsibilities that come with ownership. A recent study published in the Journal of Health Economics found that only 14% of individuals who have health coverage could correctly answer all four of four basic questions about health insurance, including understanding what a “deductible” and “copay” mean. If comprehension levels are that low for those who already have insurance, analysts worry what that might mean for first-time insurance purchasers, especially for a program as complex as Obamacare.
Persistence of the Obamacare nonpayment trend would pose serious challenges for the Obama administration’s ability to hit its goal of seven million paying customers by the end of March. 
According to the latest CNN poll, support for Obamacare is now at a record low 35%. 
Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over the next ten years."

Amazingly this exchange took place on CNN where Steve Beshear Governor of Kentucky explained that for states who chose to implement their own exchanges - as was intended by the Affordable Care Act - their ""Glitches"" have been few and far between.  
We’re signing up people at roughly a thousand a day. It’s a great rate and a great success so far,” he told on CNN’s “New Day,” describing the market as “a gold standard because it’s working.”...
[The Federal System] will be working fully in a month or two.  History shows us that [after the implication of Medicare] it took two years to get it all working properly.  This will all work.


Later the CNN Hosts talks to Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) - she of the Run-Away AR-15 - to get their usual ""other side"" of the obligatory ""both sides"" view - only to have her attempt to completely contradict and dismiss everything that Gov. Beshear had just said.
Only something interesting happened, the CNN Host wasn't having it.


http://thinkprogress.org/...
ELLMERS: I know you had the clip of the governor and God bless him. He’s talking about a situation that he supports. American people cannot wait for this. There are hard working taxpayers –
CAROL COSTELLO (HOST): Was the governor joshing us? Is he not telling the truth?
ELLMERS: I’m not exactly sure it is working in Kentucky…..
COSTELLO: So the governor when he says he’s signing up 1,000 people a day and wants to get the 640,000 people in Kentucky insured, he’s just saying that for political purposes?
ELLMERS: Well, you know, let’s look again at the grand scheme of things. It is a failure at monumental levels. [...]
COSTELLO: But you’re discounting everything that the Kentucky governor is saying. Instead of sitting down with him and saying, governor, let’s talk and figure this out together. Let’s figure out what’s political in what you’re saying. You’re discounting what he has to say outright.
Though the federal HealthCare.gov appears to face serious technical problems, state-run marketplaces like Kentucky appear adept at quickly fixing problems and are successfully enrolling people. In Kentucky, 10,766 applications for health coverage were initiated on the first day and “6,909 completed and 2,989 families were enrolled.” Nearly 150,000 New Yorkers have signed up for Obamacare and 35,528 enrollments were completed in three weeks in Washington state.

During the discussion Rep. Ellmers endorses the Republicans American Healthcare Reform Act which it seems is largely just another big Tort Reform Bill that would remove the Ban on Pre-Existing Conditions, would remove the ability to keep your children on your healthcare until they're 26 - (although it would provide a Fund for the poor to purchase these seperately)  it would take away ""Obama Regulators"" - which in short, would remove all the protections, minimum coverage requirements and life-time caps - and put ""Decisions in the hands the Consumers"" - in other words, ""Good Luck, Chumps!""  And of course, no more Exchanges where cost can be amortized across are large pool of applicants.
There you have it. Typical Tea Bagging.  When confronted with Facts that contradict their delusions they try to Huff and Puff and Blow Your Reality Down!.
Except sometimes, it just doesn't work - because some of us aren't living in the BullShit-Based World.

If you spend any time watching cable news networks you've seen Sen. Ted Cruz's (R-FL) first ad of the 2016 presidential campaign attempt to whip up grassroots support for his increasingly unpopular defund Obamacare campaign. True to the teabagger audience Cruz is aiming for, this ad is as full of lies as every other attack they've made on the law. The Washington Post's fact checker counts the ways.
First up, this statement from the ad: ""Democratic Senator Max Baucus, the lead author of Obamacare, says it’s a huge train wreck.""
Ever since the Montana senator, a key writer of the bill, uttered the phrase “huge train wreck” during an April 17 budget hearing, his words have become a major GOP talking point. But Baucus’s comment has been taken out of context—and he has since said that his concerns have been addressed. [...]
In other words, no more train wreck. In fact, contrary to Cruz’s suggestion, Baucus is still highly supportive of the law. [...]
Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Baucus’s new stance “makes no difference, it’s what he said. We still agree with his original assertion that it’s a train wreck.”

Well, of course new facts make no difference to Cruz, just like old facts don't make any difference. Facts in general aren't really a priority for the guy. Why should they be a priority? You obviously don't need them to get elected to statewide office in Texas.
Cruz also says in the ad, ""The president is quietly granting Obamacare waivers to big corporations,"" citing a New York Times article that doesn't focus on waivers. As Kessler points out, the article the ad is misusing is about the delay the administration announced in implementing the employer mandate in the law. Not a waiver, a delay. Yeah, facts again.
Finally, Cruz leaps on statements by Teamsters President James Hoffa and other union leaders, saying that even big labor admits that the law will ""destroy the foundation of the 40-hour week that is the backbone of the American middle class."" It's true that labor officials, while praising the law's ultimate goals, have complained about the possibility that employers will cut worker's hours to avoid the law. That's part of what the delay in the employer mandate was all about, giving employers more time to figure this out. But so far the only evidence for that comes from a few highly publicized and politicized claims by big employers, nothing more.
So, it's official, according to the Washington Post. Ted Cruz is a big, fat liar. Not that you need the WaPo to tell you that. All you need is to see Ted Cruz open his mouth.

458,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/07/cbs-news-obamacare-about-to-hit-employer-provided-insurance,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,CBS News: ObamaCare About to Hit Employer-Provided Insurance,"
With his credibility shot, CBS News has apparently decided to not take President Obama’s latest ObamaCare promise at face value. Now that millions whom the president reassured could keep their insurance are losing it, CBS dug into Obama’s latest reassurance about the 80% not in the individual market, and also found that that’s not exactly true. The truth is that a so-called “Cadillac Tax” is about to turn millions of employer-based plans into something a little closer to a “junk plan.”
“If you’re one of the 80 percent of Americans who is insured or covered through an employer plan or through Medicare or Medicaid, or the Veterans’ Administration, there is no change for you except for an increase in benefits that everyone receives as a result of the Affordable Care Act,” White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday.
Yet in the years to come, some workers with employer-provided benefits will see their benefits scaled back because of an Obamacare tax. That portion of the law — known as the “Cadillac tax” — isn’t set to take effect until 2018, but it’s already influencing the benefits packages that employers offer.
“Every employer plan since the passage of the health care law has been working to make sure their health care cost trends keep their plans under the ‘Cadillac tax,'” Steve Wojcik of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit that represents large employers, told CBSNews.com.
It is hard to tell if CBS News is just getting on the record with this report, or if the media is actually going to start doing its job with ObamaCare and give America a heads up on the fallout yet to come. 
From the moment ObamaCare looked like a reality, conservative think tanks and Republican lawmakers sounded the warning that millions would lose their health insurance as a result. All the media did in response, though,  was to either ignore those warnings or push back on behalf of the White House and Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. 
The effect ObamaCare will have on the employer-based market — over a hundred million people — is not limited to this Cadillac Tax. The White House itself estimated that tens of millions could be dropped by their employers and shoved into these ObamaCare exchanges. This could mean losing your doctor and having your health care options limited in a traumatic way, especially if you are already ill. 
Though this unsettling White House report is out there, the media have yet to give it the attention deserved or to push the Administration to explain it, especially now that the president is claiming those 80% have nothing to worry about.  
The carnage that has already blindsided millions of middle class families in the individual market is only the beginning of the financial chaos ObamaCare is almost certain to rain down on tens of millions who made the mistake of taking a president at his word.

It only took five years for the American media to get tired of President Obama’s spoon-fed propaganda — well, at least one aspect of it. Earlier this month, 38 news organizations, including the Associated Press, ABC News, The Washington Post, and Reuters demanded more photojournalist access to the president. The White House responded with what one reporter described as a middle finger. Now some news organizations are responding by formalizing policies not to publish White House-distributed photographs. 
Last week the USA Today announced that it will not use “handout photos originating from the White House Press Office, except in very extraordinary circumstances.” The next day McClatchy joined the conditional boycott:
“The editors of McClatchy newspapers have agreed not to publish photography issued by the White House,” McClatchy Vice President for News/Washington Editor Anders Gyllenhaal told staffers in an email Tuesday night. The policy is not “a significant departure from current practices,” he says.
Both McClatchy and USA Today claim that these were their policies anyway, which makes one wonder what the point is. 
For those of us outside the DC-Manhattan bubble, it is really quite incredible to watch the elite media crybaby in this way. Our media has extraordinary power, when they choose to use it. The problem is that, when it comes to this president, they rarely choose to use it. 
No one respects their sycophants, which is why this White House is so comfortable ignoring, dismissing, and even ridiculing the mainstream media. 
This whole brouhaha surrounding photojournalist access is a perfect example. Nothing changes and what happens? The White House receives a strongly worded internal policy affirmation. 
If the media want some respect from this White House, they need to start doing something as simple as their jobs. But the White House knows that no matter how shabbily they treat the media, the media will still carry their water. For example, the ObamaCare cover ups continue to this day. Sure, the media is covering the smoking guns as they become too obvious to ignore, but they still refuse to warn the public that millions more insurance cancellations are coming. 
The media’s laughable and humiliating impotence will continue until they man up and stop running point for Obama’s agenda. 
Personally, I don’t believe the media’s protests about a lack of photojournalist access have anything to do with journalistic integrity. I think the media’s upset because they can’t get close to their sun king.

460,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/08/CNN-Blames-Christians-for-Obamacare-Problems,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,CNN Blames Christians for Obamacare Problems,"
CNN has blamed Christians for the problem of Americans without health insurance, calling it “The Obamacare ‘scandal’ you haven’t heard about.” In an article on CNN.com’s Belief Blog, CNN writer John Blake says that, while famous pastors “preach in states where crosses and church steeples dot the skyline,” they do nothing about “the poor who can’t get the health insurance they would receive if they lived elsewhere.”
That refers, in turn, to the decision of twenty-five states not to participate in Obamacare’s expanded Medicaid funding. The states were allowed to opt out following last year’s controversial Supreme Court decision on Obamacare, which upheld the law as a whole but struck down the mandatory state participation in Medicaid expansion, citing the protection provided to state powers under the Tenth Amendment.
Some Republican states took the funding anyway, which provides health insurance subsidies for households with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level. Though the federal government will initially cover almost all of the cost, many Republican governors are wary of potential future costs, and are also worried about the effect on the federal budget itself. Many are also opposed to participating in the Obamacare program on principle.
CNN seems to think that the choice to opt out of Obamacare is somehow the responsibility of well-known pastors such as Joel Osteen and T.D. Jakes, who declined to comment for Blake’s article. One minister, Rev. Phil Wages, said he would not preach that states should accept Medicaid funding because he does not believe that care for the poor is the primary responsibility of the government, according to Christian teachings.
Beyond that, most churches are non-profit organizations whose tax-exempt status might be threatened if they became involved in political causes. Blake recognizes that, but strongly suggests that churches have a duty regardless. (Curiously, he does not suggest that churches should preach against Obamacare because of the millions of families that are losing their health insurance plans, contrary to the president’s promises.)
Blake covers different perspectives on the question of speaking out. But the premise of CNN’s article is that churches are to blame for Obamacare’s failures–not the federal government, not the Democrats who passed it, and not President Barack Obama himself. The thinly-veiled implication–a repeated theme in leftist critiques–is that Christians are hypocrites who care about personal salvation, but not about good works."

Barack Obama’s hometown newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, endorsed the president twice for president. Friday, the same Chicago Tribune called for ObamaCare to be immediately repealed before it can do any more damage:
Stop digging. Start over.
As Friday dawns, here’s what a health insurance crisis looks like to many millions of Americans: Barely six weeks shy of 2014, they do not know whether they will have medical coverage Jan. 1. Or which hospitals and doctors they might patronize. Or what they may pay to protect themselves and their families against the chance of medical and financial catastrophe. How much, that is, they may pay in order to satisfy the Democratic politicians and federal bureaucrats who are worsening a metastasizing health coverage fiasco. …
We understand why the president and leaders of his party want to rescue whatever they can of Obamacare. On their watch, official Washington has blown the launch of a new entitlement program … under the schedule they alone set in early 2010.
What we don’t understand is their reluctance to give that failure more than lip service. Many of the Americans who heard their president say Thursday that “we fumbled the rollout of this health care law” would have been pleased to hear him add: So we’re admitting it. This law is a bust. We’re starting over.
You can expect the calls to repeal ObamaCare to grow from non-GOP sources in the coming days. The news released Saturday that thousands of doctors have been dropped from Medicare Advantage is a likely tipping point. Destroying health care for the elderly is The Third Rail on steroids. This is Armageddon for Democrats. The only chance they have is to repeal. If they do not, they will be wiped out in 2014 and 2016.

August 2013 is not looking a whole lot like August 2009, not where town meetings are concerned, anyway. Wednesday night, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), an ardent Obamacare foe, didn't face an adoring crowd of teabaggers there to shout their support for him and scream their hatred for Obamacare.
Instead, he got a message about the law that he probably wasn't expecting, including from the woman in the video above who lost her son to colon cancer, largely because it was caught too late. It was caught late because he didn't have insurance because of a preexisting condition, a birth defect. She wasn't the only one McHenry heard from.
They all wanted direct answers from the congressman Wednesday evening, and many of them, including Skip Edwards, questioned the Republican’s position on the Affordable Care Act.
Edwards and his wife, both 63, had health insurance until he lost his job during the recession and the East Asheville couple found themselves in financial trouble despite staying relatively healthy.
Both had pre-existing conditions and were denied insurance, making them eligible for a state plan called Inclusive Health.
“It cost us $1,300 bucks a month — extremely expensive,” Edwards said. “It taps us out every month. But at our age and health, we’ve got to have it.”

McHenry's response was typically lame—he loves the stuff about no more discriminating for preexisting conditions and allowing young people to stay on parents' plan until their 26, but didn't explain how his repeated votes to repeal and defund the law that includes those protections preserved them.
Instead, he talked about the usual stuff Republicans talk about: expanding high risk pools, ""adding 'That is more of a solution than I think that Obamacare will be,' as many in the crowd groaned."" He also said that people should be able to buy insurance across state lines, another big Republican ""solution."" Not surprisingly, ""Edwards was not satisfied with the congressman’s answer.""
That's what happens when Republicans are forced to confront the reality of actual people who really need health insurance. They've never had real answers and they've never been able to present a valid alternative. That's why we haven't heard ""repeal and replace"" since 2010; they've never had a ""replace."" It's why the answer now is ""repeal, defund, and/or shutdown government."" It's only ever been about selling the rabid base the idea that they could kill the law.
11:03 AM PT: American Bridge has released their video of the exchange between Mr. Edwards and Rep. McHenry. The audience reaction to McHenry is priceless. And it's about time he heard it.

Amazingly this exchange took place on CNN where Steve Beshear Governor of Kentucky explained that for states who chose to implement their own exchanges - as was intended by the Affordable Care Act - their ""Glitches"" have been few and far between.  
We’re signing up people at roughly a thousand a day. It’s a great rate and a great success so far,” he told on CNN’s “New Day,” describing the market as “a gold standard because it’s working.”...
[The Federal System] will be working fully in a month or two.  History shows us that [after the implication of Medicare] it took two years to get it all working properly.  This will all work.


Later the CNN Hosts talks to Rep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) - she of the Run-Away AR-15 - to get their usual ""other side"" of the obligatory ""both sides"" view - only to have her attempt to completely contradict and dismiss everything that Gov. Beshear had just said.
Only something interesting happened, the CNN Host wasn't having it.


http://thinkprogress.org/...
ELLMERS: I know you had the clip of the governor and God bless him. He’s talking about a situation that he supports. American people cannot wait for this. There are hard working taxpayers –
CAROL COSTELLO (HOST): Was the governor joshing us? Is he not telling the truth?
ELLMERS: I’m not exactly sure it is working in Kentucky…..
COSTELLO: So the governor when he says he’s signing up 1,000 people a day and wants to get the 640,000 people in Kentucky insured, he’s just saying that for political purposes?
ELLMERS: Well, you know, let’s look again at the grand scheme of things. It is a failure at monumental levels. [...]
COSTELLO: But you’re discounting everything that the Kentucky governor is saying. Instead of sitting down with him and saying, governor, let’s talk and figure this out together. Let’s figure out what’s political in what you’re saying. You’re discounting what he has to say outright.
Though the federal HealthCare.gov appears to face serious technical problems, state-run marketplaces like Kentucky appear adept at quickly fixing problems and are successfully enrolling people. In Kentucky, 10,766 applications for health coverage were initiated on the first day and “6,909 completed and 2,989 families were enrolled.” Nearly 150,000 New Yorkers have signed up for Obamacare and 35,528 enrollments were completed in three weeks in Washington state.

During the discussion Rep. Ellmers endorses the Republicans American Healthcare Reform Act which it seems is largely just another big Tort Reform Bill that would remove the Ban on Pre-Existing Conditions, would remove the ability to keep your children on your healthcare until they're 26 - (although it would provide a Fund for the poor to purchase these seperately)  it would take away ""Obama Regulators"" - which in short, would remove all the protections, minimum coverage requirements and life-time caps - and put ""Decisions in the hands the Consumers"" - in other words, ""Good Luck, Chumps!""  And of course, no more Exchanges where cost can be amortized across are large pool of applicants.
There you have it. Typical Tea Bagging.  When confronted with Facts that contradict their delusions they try to Huff and Puff and Blow Your Reality Down!.
Except sometimes, it just doesn't work - because some of us aren't living in the BullShit-Based World.

notes the Republican hope that when the Affordable Care Act goes into effect people will be so shocked it will give their side a political advantage,   In his New York Times column he lays out his premise with news many here already know; his second paragraph reads
No doubt there will be problems, as there are with any large new government initiative, and in this case, we have the added complication that many Republican governors and legislators are doing all they can to sabotage reform. Yet important new evidence — especially from California, the law’s most important test case — suggests that the real Obamacare shock will be one of unexpected success.
Except there will be places where it will not be as big a success, and that, too will play AGAINST Republicans.



It is important to remember that Krugman is not merely a brilliant economist, but an astute political observer, as his columns over the past decade have made clear.  Often, because he understands the economic impact of certain decisions, he is able to lay out what the political consequences will be, while others offer thoughts that may seemingly make political sense to the conventional thinkers of the DC village, but since they are based on wrong-headed economic thinking inevitably turn out incorrectly.  
Krugman lays out in detail what the problems are in insuring a population in which only some had health insurance.  If you merely require coverage of pre-existing condition and the healthy uninsured do not sign up, as was the case in New York, premiums can skyrocket, as the healthy risk going uninsured.  Or else you confront the situation where those with previous conditions can be reject for insurance.  To these observations I would add the additional one of being locked into a job once a condition is diagnosed, even at pay levels far below what one could make elsewhere, because either the employee or a family member now has a preexisting condition.
Obamacare closes this gap with a three-part approach. First, community rating everywhere — no more exclusion based on pre-existing conditions. Second, the “mandate” — you must buy insurance even if you’re currently healthy. Third, subsidies to make insurance affordable for those with lower incomes.
This is, as Krugman notes, the approach taken in Massachusetts, where it has been successful and remains popular, even if the former governor responsible for the approach Krugman labels ""ObamaRomneyCare"" tried to distance himself from it in the most recent presidential campaign.  
But the Bay State already had community rating and relatively low rates of uninsured (and for the latter I might argue that because of heavy unionization even non-union workplaces tended to offer good medical insurance as a means of dissuading employees from organizing)>  A state like California, which lacked both, was supposed to demonstrate the problems with the approach taken in ACA.
Except as we all know, as the bids have come in, they have been lower than expected.
Krugman is aware that the plan ia complicated, because simpler options like Medicare for all were taken off the table.  And there are states where Republicans have done all they can to block ACA, which will create more confusion - although we are seeing the oddities like that of Arizona, which Krugman does not mention, where the conservative Republican governor is vetoing all legislation until her conservative Republican legislature agrees to the expansion of Medicaid necessary for those uninsured too poor to afford to buy insurance on their own.   Krugman notes, that
in states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion, such unfortunates will be left out in the cold.
Above, I talked about the perspicacity of Krugman's political analysis.  In that regard, perhaps the most important paragraph in this column is its penultimate:  
Still, here’s what it seems is about to happen: millions of Americans will suddenly gain health coverage, and millions more will feel much more secure knowing that such coverage is available if they lose their jobs or suffer other misfortunes. Only a relative handful of people will be hurt at all. And as contrasts emerge between the experience of states like California that are making the most of the new policy and that of states like Texas whose politicians are doing their best to undermine it, the sheer meanspiritedness of the Obamacare opponents will become ever more obvious.
Take Texas for example.  A state that is no longer majority White, non-Hispanic.  It is also a state where the percentage of uninsured is astronomical.  If that population begins to realize what the Republicans are doing to them, and gets registered, is it possible that the state could flip as early as 2014?  If the Democrats in the state, running for federal and state offices campaign on this issue, might it be possible to also make significant changes in the House delegation?
Let's recognize something.  The insurance companies like ACA, because it expands their pool of customers.  They do not care whether they are paid by tax deductible support from employers or by federal and state taxes for Medicaid - it is still revenue for them.
The meanspiritedness of Republicans, particular in the House, where they may well reject a compromise on immigration, will become even more of an issue when people see the difference the Affordable Care Act can make.
And then there is the challenge on the philosophy of government - or should we say in the case of Tea Party Republicans, the philosophy of a lack of government?  It is this that Krugman addresses in his final paragraph:  
So yes, it does look as if there’s an Obamacare shock coming: the shock of learning that a public program designed to help a lot of people can, strange to say, end up helping a lot of people — especially when government officials actually try to make it work.
CLip and save this column.  Remember it when we see the real political impact of ACA in next year's elections.

While it is truly hard to keep up with the sheer amount of graft, giveaways, turning of blind eyes, and special favors that has emanated from Rick Perry's 13 years in the Governor's mansion, when following the tale of SB5/SB1 it is hard to miss the crucial results of one of the provisions:
#SB5 requires every abortion provider to be licensed as an ambulatory surgery center. This requirement will costs providers about $1 million and will have to comply with 117 pages of regulation. It is expected that all but five clinics would not be able to afford to stay open because they simply cannot afford to comply with these regulations.
Wait, an ambulatory surgery center, that's just the religious right chipping away at abortion around the edges, right? No one could possibly stand to gain from this provision, could they? Follow me below the fold.



Thank you Houston Chronicle for following the money:
If the bill passes, only five Texas abortion clinics would remain open—those that are already equipped as ambulatory surgical centers, advocates say. But a question remains: would the 420 other ambulatory surgical centers that exist in Texas begin performing the operation? Abortion rights advocates predict that the demand for the procedure won’t disappear with passage of the law.
One company that will be faced with that decision is United Surgical Partners International, based in Addison, TX. Their vice-president of government affairs is Milla Perry Jones, Gov. Rick Perry’s sister. She is also on the board of the Texas Ambulatory Surgical Center Society.

So if this bill passes, it provides Rick Perry's sister's company an opportunity to move into a new field, one where poor women can be charged an exorbitant rate for a desperate procedure. Expect abortions in Texas to continue, just at 2-3 times the previous going rates.

What are his constituents going to think when they realize he's been lying to them about Obamacare?



What are his constituents going to think when they realize he's been lying to them about Obamacare?

The polling has been around for a while: if you ask people about the various provisions of Obamacare, they love it; if you ask them about Obamacare, they hate it. Now that the program is about to kick off, that's being confirmed on the ground. In Kentucky.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A middle-aged man in a red golf shirt shuffles up to a small folding table with gold trim, in a booth adorned with a flotilla of helium balloons, where government workers at the Kentucky State Fair are hawking the virtues of Kynect, the state’s health benefit exchange established by Obamacare.
The man is impressed. ""This beats Obamacare I hope,"" he mutters to one of the workers.
""Do I burst his bubble?"" wonders Reina Diaz-Dempsey, overseeing the operation. She doesn't. If he signs up, it's a win-win, whether he knows he's been ensnared by Obamacare or not.

That's absolutely why Republicans are frantic to try to find a way to stop Obamacare from starting. As the message about its benefits get out, as people sign up and start receiving those benefits, they're going to forget all about being scared of it and they're going to like it.
But it's not a slam-dunk, and the public education effort is key because Republican lies have taken hold with plenty of people. Erin Hoven, an outreach worker with Kentucky Voices for Health, and her efforts to do outreach and education on Obamacare faces those lies—repeated regularly by both of the state's Republican senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul—at every turn.
A woman Hoben had been working with in Hazard called her recently to tell her that the tea party had urged her not to enroll because the exchange wasn’t happening. [Hoben] went door to door with a free lunch program in Laurel County. She met a mother in a trailer, she recalls, who believed she was going to jail if she didn't sign up for insurance. What startled Hoben was that the mother seemed to just erroneously accept the potential jail time as a fact of life. ""I quickly explained to her that was not going to happen,"" Hoben says.
Will these people believe it when Hoben or others tell them that none of this stuff is true? Not until they see the lies be disproved and they see it start working. That gives Republicans in the states one more chance to defeat Obamacare: sabotage it at the state level in its implementation, like in the states where the new health care navigators, community workers hired under the law to help people navigate the new system, are being hindered by onerous new requirements and regulations.
Because the worst thing in the world for Republicans is having more people get affordable health care.

Fraud.



Fraud.

Sen. Ted Cruz had a short exchange with Sen. Dick Durbin at the tail end of his blabathon Wednesday.
“Will the senator from Texas for the record tell us now—and those who watched this debate—whether he is protected and his family’s protected?” Durbin asked Wednesday morning, repeating a question he'd been trying to get Cruz to answer.
“I’m happy to tell you now I am eligible for it and I am not currently covered under it,” Cruz responded, diverting the conversation to an uninsured diabetic woman that Durbin had mentioned earlier.

Then the conversation moved on without Cruz explaining where he got his coverage. Huffington Post's Ryan Grim found out. He's covered on his wife's plan. His wife is a top Wall Street executive, a regional head of a Goldman Sachs division.
According to a 2009 New York Times report, top executive officers and managing directors at the bank participate in a health care program that costs Goldman more than $40,000 in premiums for each particpant’s family annually.
Yep, a regular populist, Cruz is, telling all the people that freedom means not having health insurance from his perch ensconced in a gold-plated safety net.

469,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/10/14/Ryan-We-Demanded-Individual-Mandate-Delay-on-Obamacare,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Ryan: We Demanded Individual Mandate Delay on Obamacare,"
Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), chair of the House Budget Committee, told conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes Monday morning that House Republicans had demanded a one-year delay in Obamacare’s individual mandate, along with an end to congressional exemptions, while offering a six-week debt ceiling hike to allow room for negotiations on broader budget issues. The offer was made to President Barack Obama last Thursday.
President Obama, said Ryan, listened but declined to respond. In the meantime, Ryan said, it became clear the president was negotiating separately to obtain more favorable terms from Senate Republicans, trying to “jam” the House Republicans in the process. Ryan told Sykes that Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had “overplayed their hand” in attempting to prolong the crisis to maximize political damage to Republicans.
Ryan described the delay to the individual mandate as an “obvious” step to take, given that technical issues with the Obamacare exchanges might prevent the mandate from being enforced at all. “We could have spent the weekend putting an agreement together that says we’re gonna deal with the debt, we’re gonna deal with this economy, and we’re gonna fix these big flaws in Obamacare, or at least give people delays in these penalties.”
Instead, he said, the President and his party had declined, believing that they had a “partisan advantage.” In response to new demands from Democrats to cancel the sequester cuts in the Budget Control Act of 2011, Ryan declared: “We are not going to give on these spending numbers.” He said that there were some areas of agreement on changes to entitlements, but that Democrats wanted to spend more money and preserve Obamacare.
Ryan said that he believed the strategy of attempting to defund Obamacare had been a mistake, because the government shutdown would not have prevented Obamacare from being implemented. “It’s an autopilot spending program,” he said, saying that the idea Obamacare could be defunded was a “false impression.” He added, however, that the focus needed to shift to the damage Obamacare was causing to consumers and the economy.
“I do believe that we can still get some changes made to Obamacare that help provide some relief to working Americans,” Ryan said. He was optimistic that the House would craft a workable plan for avoiding default following a meeting of the GOP caucus on Monday evening. “I didn’t go to Congress to kick the can,” he said, noting that his biggest fear was that “a handful of Republicans” in the Senate would join Democrats to “jam” the House."

For the past week, NBC News correspondent Chuck Todd endured withering criticism for suggesting it is not the media's job to expose Republican lies about the Affordable Care Act or, for that matter, anything else. But despite his assertion that the reporter's function is not to seek the objective truth but instead to serve as a stenographer for partisan talking points, Todd has from time to time actually shed light rather than heat. His recent contrast of the all-out GOP obstructionism of Obamacare to Democrats' contribution to the success of President Bush's Medicare prescription drug plan is one example.
Despite last week's embarrassment, Chuck Todd hasn't always represented a net subtraction from the sum of human knowledge. As the GOP's ""Defund Obamacare"" campaign ramped up over the summer, Todd used his NBC ""First Read"" column to actively illuminate rather than passively mislead. As he and his colleagues put it on July 9:
Here's a thought exercise on this summer morning: Imagine that after the controversial Medicare prescription-drug legislation was passed into law in 2003, Democrats did everything they could to thwart one of George W. Bush's top domestic achievements. They launched Senate filibusters to block essential HHS appointees from administering the law; they warned the sports and entertainment industries from participating in any public service announcements to help seniors understand how the law works; and, after taking control of the House of Representatives in 2007, they used the power of the purse to prohibit any more federal funds from being used to implement the law. As it turns out, none of that happened.
That's exactly right. Despite their opposition to the Part D legislation, Democrats didn't just refuse to obstruct Bush's wildly unpopular and completely unfunded $400 billion windfall for insurers and pharmaceutical firms. In Washington and in the states, Democrats helped ensure the successful implementation of a Republican program whose 2006 launch even John Boehner acknowledged was ""horrendous.""
As you'll see below, Todd was right to highlight the polar opposite partisan responses to President Bush's Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and President Obama's Affordable Care Act of 2010.


For starters, almost every Democrat (189 out of 205 in the House, 35 out of 46 in the Senate) voted against Medicare Part D 10 years ago. But unlike the Republicans who uniformly voted no to the ACA in 2010 because they feared what its success would mean for the GOP's political prospects, Democrats opposed Bush's Medicare Rx plan because it was unnecessarily complex and needlessly expensive for taxpayers. After all, the Medicare Modernization didn't just prohibit the federal government from directly negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices, but forced beneficiaries to purchase coverage from private insurers rather than expand the lower cost Medicare program to include the new benefit.
For those reasons and more, Medicare Part D was far more unpopular before it launched than Obamacare is now. But that changed over time. Now, 9 out of 10 seniors are happy with the program they once despised. In part, Democratic cooperation explains why.
After all, when the Bush administration spent millions of dollars on television ads beginning in 2004 to promote the new Medicare drug discount cards, Democrats didn't object. (They just asked that the Bush Department of Health and Human Services tell the truth.)  Despite that history and the fact that HHS funds advertising for Medicare enrollment every fall, grandstanding GOP Senator Marco Rubio called for a halt to the current ACA TV spots, accusing HHS of ""blatant misuse of federal dollars.""
The same contrast applies to the so-called ""navigators,"" the dozens of community groups, charitable organization, hospitals and non-profits that will Americans find health insurance now just as they helped the elderly find prescription drug plans. Now, Republicans on Ohio, Georgia, Texas, West Virginia and Florida are boasting about the efforts to block the work of the navigators in their states. As Georgia Insurance Commission Ralph Hudgens crowed:
""Let me tell you what we're doing [about Obamacare.] Everything in our power to be an obstructionist.""
""We have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance. The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we'll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we're going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write 'navigator test' on it.""

As President Bush's former Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt explained in July, the ""navigators"" were critical to the outreach campaign for Medicare Part D:
Before the program was implemented, only 21 percent of seniors had a favorable opinion of it, and 66 percent didn't understand what the reform would mean for them.
So we spent 18 months devising and implementing a campaign to explain the prescription drug benefit, prepare seniors as well as partners -- such as community groups, churches, pharmacies, insurance plans and state and local governments -- and then sign people up. A national bus tour supported each phase. The summer before enrollment (the same period that the ACA is in now) we logged more than 600,000 miles and visited 48 states. As secretary, I made 119 stops in 98 cities. I learned that with a program like the ACA, you can't count on Washington to sell it. You have to reach people where they live, work, pray and play.

Many of the same navigators then (like the AARP) are Obamacare navigators now. Ironically, President Bush and his Republican allies also counted on organization that doesn't exist anymore: ACORN.
Nevertheless, the Bush administration rollout of the Medicare drug benefit for 43 million elderly Americans was a disaster. Ohio Congressman John Boehner admitted as much to Fox News in February 2006:
""The implementation of the Medicare plan has been horrendous,""
As Ezra Klein recently recounted, in a rare moment of candor the future Speaker was right:
In 2006, the bill went into effect. It was a disaster. Computer systems didn't communicate with one another. Seniors were confused. Some of the poorest and sickest enrollees -- ""dual eligibles"" who qualify for aid under both Medicare and Medicaid -- weren't able to get their drugs. It was so bad that in his 2006 State of the Union address, Bush ""said nothing about the new Medicare prescription drug program, an initiative Republicans once hoped to trumpet but has angered many seniors in its implementation,"" reported the Washington Post.
Unlike Republicans like Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) and Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) who have announced they will not answer constituents' calls for help with Obamacare, Democrats took a different approach. As then Senator Hillary Clinton reasoned in 2006:
""I voted against it, but once it passed I certainly determined that I would try to do everything I could to make sure that New Yorkers understood it, could access it, and make the best of it.""
When Wisconsin Senator Kohl, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Aging asked his colleagues ""to put aside any partisan thoughts to work together to get this program running,"" Democratic governors were already spending billions of dollars to help out.
As the Washington Post reported in January 2006, ""Two weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug program, many of the nation's sickest and poorest elderly and disabled people are being turned away or overcharged at pharmacies, prompting more than a dozen states to declare health emergencies and pay for their life-saving medicines."" Roughly 6.4 million seniors who just days earlier had gotten their prescriptions for free faced the prospect of going without because of untrained pharmacists and computer glitches. By January 16th, 2006, the New York Times reported, many states (most of them led by Democrats) came to their rescue. ""About 20 states, including California, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and all of New England, have announced that they will help low-income people by paying drug claims that should have been paid by the federal Medicare program."" Among the governors taking action were future Obamacare foes Tim Pawlenty and Mike Huckabee, who declared a health emergency in his state of Arkansas. The fiasco prompted the Bush administration to take drastic measures:
With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug.
It's no wonder why Paul Krugman summed up the whole catastrophe as ""D for Debacle.""
The blame for that debacle has to be placed squarely at the feet of President Bush and his Republican allies who structured the Medicare Part D bill. But once the ill-conceived legislation was the law of the land, Democrats didn't stand in their way. They helped make it work. Democrats didn't go the Supreme Court, or refuse to accept coverage for millions in their states, or say no to enforcing new insurance rules or try to prevent the work of the navigators receiving federal grants to provide information and customer service to Americans.
As Chuck Todd explained in a rare act of journalism, only Republicans do that.

Nope. (Crooks and Liars)

No. I refuse to engage you, crazy Fox News person.
A Fox News medical expert on Tuesday argued that President Barack Obama's administration was wrong to force gender equality for health insurance rates because men ""only have the prostate,"" while women ""have the breasts, they have the ovaries.""
It's bad enough to have future serial killer Keith Ablow on the teevee dispensing creepy psychological advice with all the finesse of a monkey wielding a hatchet, I'm not going to listen to some other Foxian bozo argue that women should be charged more for health insurance because they's got more parts.
It's not that I don't have a strong stomach for these things, either, which is why it's no particular stretch to listen to Fox News blowhard not-Steve-Doocy opine that women should be charged more because they live longer, or to Gretchen Carlson observing that women should get a discount because men tend to wait longer to see the doctor and end up having more expensive problems, or we could even go with the old bit about how duh, women are the ones having the babies so they naturally use more healthcare—but what's that, the good doc here isn't going to go with even that one, he's so wedded to the womens has parts argument?
Carlson pointed out that women were blamed for maternity costs, ""but men and women have babies together.""
""I agree with you that it's a shared responsibility,"" [Fox News Medical A-Team contributor Dr. David Samadi] said. ""But just the way the system are -- in my field, we only have the prostate. Women have the breasts, they have the ovaries, they have the uterus. They get checked in every part.""

OH MY GOD NO. I am not doing this. I am not going to even list off the reasons why this statement made by an actual as-seen-on-teevee-medical-doctor-hi-doctor-nick-expert-guy is stupid, because it does not deserve even that much. I am instead going to simply observe that it is something that somebody actually said, and again use the occasion as proof that the show Fox & Friends is a secret, long-running plot to make America paste-eatingly stupid via osmosis.

The better the access to health care for her constituents, the poorer the odds for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Republican Party.



The better the access to health care for her constituents, the poorer the odds for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's Republican Party.

From Joan's earlier piece on South Carolina's expanding Medicaid rolls:
Medicaid rolls in South Carolina will grow by about 162,000 people by the middle of 2015. Had the state expanded Medicaid, another 340,000 people would get coverage. As it is, at least many more children will be covered, and their parents will probably find out in the process that if their governor hadn't been such an asshole, they would have coverage, too.  
Even in South Carolina, a state hostile to Obamacare expansion, hundreds of thousands of people are benefiting just from greater awareness of existing government programs for which they do qualify. And while most of those beneficiaries are children, those children have families who would appreciate access to similar services, if only Republicans would get out of the way.
But South Carolina is solidly Red, right? Romney won the state by 11 points, right? So it doesn't matter! Except that in raw totals, Romney won by around 204,000 votes. And Republicans assume (perhaps rightly) that every Obamacare beneficiary will become much more favorable toward the government. And if you start thinking government can help you, Republicans don't stand a chance.
So for the them, it's bad enough that nearly 200,000 South Carolina residents (mostly children) will soon be part of their so-called ""culture of dependency"". That alone has potentially negative electoral ramifications. But had South Carolina taken federal dollars to give another 340,000 of its residents access to low-cost health services, their entire GOP's existence would be imperiled.
That's why Republicans continue to fight tooth and nail against Obamacare, from seeking its repeal to sabotaging its rollout. It's an existential crisis. The more people benefit, the harder it will be for them to argue that government is irreparably broken and must be drowned in Grover Norquist's bathtub.

Yesterday I received a rebate check from my insurance company. This rebate came about because of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) that specifically forces health insurance companies to spend no more than 20 percent on expenses not attributable to health care. No longer are they allowed to take your premiums and convert it to profits for shareholders, salaries for executives, and the purchase of politicians.
The Republican Party has been successful in misinforming and lying about Obamacare. This is likely one of the most immoral actions giving that slowing implementation and in the case of many Republican governors not accepting full implementation, is tantamount to the murder of American citizens with the weapon of knowing neglect.
Yesterday morning MSNBC Chuck Todd assessed that the Obama Presidency using the Republican moniker of Obamacare for the Affordable Care Act, while cute, was stupid. Todd vastly underestimates the success of the Republicans in promoting that name so much so that most Americans immediately identify with the Obamacare as opposed to the Affordable Care Act.
Just before the elections in 2012 I interviewed two intelligent upwardly mobile middle-class women in Austin, Texas. When asked about the Affordable Care Act they were completely oblivious to it. When told it was Obamacare they immediately knew what I was talking about and said they did not know it by that name. Check out that video here. It is probative.
The Obama administration has done a poor job of promoting the Affordable Care Act. The media has failed to effectively call out the lies on the Republican side thus given these lies plausibility and mental metastases. There is a lot of good news in states where politicians have made the concerted effort to support its citizens.
As people get rebates from insurance overcharges, as exchanges open that afford individuals affordable rates, and as states that have the best interests of their citizens expand Medicaid, many will see the benefits of having a healthier, humane and moral health care system. It is incumbent upon those on the right side of history to not allow those who would put corporate interest and greed over humanity to go unpunished for the sabotage they have effected on the wellbeing of the poor and the working middle class.

Some are going to see this title and say ""that is wild hyperbole"".    But, now that we have years of empirical statistical data to review, the point is not too far off.   Over the last seven years, the Infant Mortality Rate has dropped significantly, a true positive for the US.. and something we should all be proud of.
http://www.nytimes.com/...
The states with the steepest declines in infant deaths — Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina — have long been plagued with some of the nation’s highest infant mortality rates, Dr. MacDorman added. In all four states the rate dropped by more than 20 percent from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which state data are available. The District of Columbia, which has expanded a home-visit program for poor pregnant women and stepped up other efforts to keep mothers and their babies healthy, saw the biggest drop: from 14.05 deaths per 1,000 births in 2005 to 7.86 in 2010.
This, in the end, is a real accomplishment - wanted children who are properly cared for and a decreased infant mortality rate.  A plus for all of us.   But state after state, Republicans are apparently telling us that they would prefer the OLD infant mortality rate, the one that happens with diminished pre-natal care.
http://floridaindependent.com/...
According to the “End of Session” report from the Florida House of Representatives released this week, Florida’s Healthy Start Coalitions lost $5.2 million dollars in state funding this year. Local Healthy Start coalitions provide high-quality prenatal care services for at-risk mothers and health care services for children in their communities.
This kind of pattern thinking gives us these results:  with a lower standard of care, you end up with an increased rate of infant mortality, children who die at birth or in the first twelve months of life.   Those in poverty who proceed with having a child without proper prenatal care have an increased risk of birth defects and illness, which proper prenatal care can help resolve.   Finally, women with low access to prenatal care may feel pushed to have an abortion, because they have neither the money or resources to provide for a proper pregnancy.   So, I ask Republicans:  Why have you decided that having babies (those from birth to 12 months) die at a higher rate is good?  Because good prenatal and post-birth care, which you are cutting does exactly that.   Last I checked, that was called infanticide.   And in the grand scheme of things, it makes me sick.



Sometimes, we overlook the trees and all we see is the forest.   A successful society works to help make sure that the people are well cared for, avoid illness, and have access to good medicine and good advice.   But that's not always the case, at least not to Republicans.
States like Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana have all made moves to cut prenatal care, and at the same time, they move to cut funding to planned parenthood, of course.   In their mind, it means fewer abortions.  In reality, it means far more unwanted pregnancies, and a raise in rates of infant mortality.
http://www.guttmacher.org/...
One in 10 women said that they had switched to a less expensive provider of contraceptive services. This increased demand for lower-cost services was mirrored in the survey responses from family planning providers. Two-thirds of the family planning centers surveyed noted an increase in the number of clients seeking services between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 (see chart, page 10). Importantly, the vast majority of providers surveyed said they had seen an increase in the number of clients who are poor or low income and, therefore, eligible for free or reduced-fee care from providers receiving any subsidy from the federal Title X program.
More than half the providers reported significant service delivery challenges in meeting clients' needs. Most often, they reported staff layoffs or a hiring freeze during 2009. Many also said that they had been forced to reduce the number of contraceptive methods they are able to offer; more expensive methods such as the IUD, the implant, the patch and some brand-name oral contraceptives were the most likely to be cut. One in four providers said that waiting times had increased, typically doubling from less than a week to about two weeks.

As women have less and less access to effective birthcontrol, the rate of potential unwanted pregnancy goes up.  
The republicans counter this claim with:  ""Then don't have sex"".  My response:  OK, let us see how long you men who pass these laws can go without sex.  We'll have a Jerry Seinfield like competition and check it out.
The sad fact is, this move to cut access to early care and family planning doesn't cut abortion as much as it increases infant mortality - and which is more negative to you?
In general, Owens said, many pregnant women don't realize the importance of getting their own medical problems treated.
""We know that the way we get the best pregnancy is to have a healthy mom before mom and baby are together,"" she said.

Birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States. Not all are preventable, but a mother can reduce risk by keeping her own health under control by eliminating smoking, drinking and illegal drugs.
The same is true for premature births, another leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. The March of Dimes recently released its Premature Birth Report Card and gave failing grades to Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. Mississippi has the largest premature birth rate based on the 2011 national statistics used in the report.

http://www.cnn.com/...
With conservative states leading the way in rates of birth defects and premature births.   Not all birth defects can be prevented, but many, say the March of Dimes as well as the CDC, can be prevented through good prenatal care, proper nutrition, access to routine checkups.. which includes health of the mother, blood pressure control, etc.   These are common things for those with insurance and care, but not for the poor.  
So, let's be blunt.. the decrease in prenatal care means a rise in infant mortality and an increase in children born with preventable birth defects because of lack of care.
The March of Dimes speaks to exactly how effective good pre-natal care is.
http://www.pcrm.org/...
The medical costs of care for children with disabilities resulting from birth defects have been estimated to exceed $1.4 billion annually.
While some types of birth defects have decreased, mainly through preventive methods, many have increased. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 38 types of birth defects occurring over the period 1979-89, 27 had increased, including several cardiac defects, chromosomal defects such as trisomy 18, and fetal alcohol syndrome; nine had remained the same; and only two had decreased.

That's OK, though, because Republicans will want to fund support for all the children of disabilities born because of bad prenatal care, and they will provide support for women who lose their child in the first year, right?
Don't worry, Republican governors have got that.
2. A program to help adults with disabilities live independently faces an enrollment freeze in the new budget, which will leave nearly 17,000 men and women throughout the state without vital resources over the next two years. Family Care helps provide a wide range of services such as in-home care, supported living communities, meal delivery, and job training to help keep more than 31,000 people integrated with their communities; waiting lists for private resources like housing can be well over a decade. Cutting off enrollment in Family Care is a message from Scott Walker to men and women already disproportionately affected by poverty and discrimination that in his eyes they’re less than human.
http://www.alternet.org/...
So, with more unwanted pregnancies, a higher infant mortality, and an increase in preventable birth defects, I want to know: when did Republicans become the party that likes any of these things?   Because rooting for increases in infant mortality and birth defects is so abhorrent to me, I cannot fathom the logic.
Sorry Republicans.  I prefer babies who breath and live healthy, long lives.   That's why I favor prenatal care support.    Please, advocate for me that you want more children to die after birth, as long as they aren't aborted.   Because it would be an honest assessment of how this will turn out.

During a Thursday speech pitching a health care plan that seems to grow even more unpopular every time he pitches it, President Obama tore into Fox News by all-but accusing them of lying about the increased costs of health care under ObamaCare:
—

—
The president is lying though omission there. The argument that health care costs aren’t as high as the worst nightmare scenarios predicted does not mean costs are going down, even though that is what Obama is trying to hustle people into believing. The fact is, is that while pushing his health care plan, Obama promised premiums would go down for a family of four by at least $2400 per year. The reality, however, is that costs will increase by almost two times that amount. 
For example, while Obama pointed to a reduction in premiums in New York state, state officials in Ohio say the average premium proposal for individual coverage next year is up 88 percent from this year’s average price as reported by the Society of Actuaries. In Maryland, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield proposed a 25 percent increase in premiums next year, after first seeking a 50 percent increase. Final rates haven’t been determined in either state.                                 
The higher rates, supporters say, buy a health insurance system that guarantees access to coverage for everyone and improves benefits, such as requiring insurers to cover older children and outlawing lifetime spending limits on claims.
Obama did a good job injecting a little energy into the 100th time he’s given a speech that has already failed 99 times. But attacking Fox News by name is just another example of the smallness of a man who seems to delight in making his office smaller in the eyes of the country and his country smaller in the eyes of the world.

To all you haters out there:  You gotta hand it to Lady Blah-Blah.  Going on the lamestream media to face the wrath of the liberal machine, surely she knew that she was going to be asked about her plans for an alternative to the program she has been railing against for months.  And in typical Palin fashion, she studied hard and prepared a perfect response to the liberal, socialist/fascist health-care huggers.  
Just kidding.  
Warning:  you may need to play it several times to attempt to decipher the incoherent, rambling Palin gibberish session.  But as you learned in English class, the more words you use in a sentence, the more intelligent you sound.
I give you Palin, unedited.


Matt Lauer:  ""What are we hearing from the Tea Party in terms of an absolute, realistic plan that can be an alternative to Obamacare?""
Without even thinking, Palin sprung into action:
Said Palin: ""The plan is to allow those things that had been proposed over many years to reform a health-care system in America that certainly does need more help so that there's more competition, there's less tort reform threat, there's less trajectory of the cost increases, and those plans have been proposed over and over again. And what thwarts those plans? It's the far left. It's President Obama and his supporters who will not allow the Republicans to usher in free market, patient-centered, doctor-patient relationship links to reform health care.""
Got that?
Matt Lauer, clearly not interested in deciphering any of that and not wanting to make her feel bad, simply said ""L-L-Let's move on. Let's talk about Chris Christie? Boy, he had a massive win!""
Really, it was a softball interview and Matt Lauer was an embarrassment.  You can't appreciate how bad he was until you listen to him immediately after she said that ball of stupid.  She has had months to think of a coherent response to what an alternative would be (and its not like she has had any real work to do).  A REAL journalist would have called her out on what she said:   ""What plans are you talking about that have been proposed over and over?  How is the ACA not free market?""
Or just ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand any of that.  What?""
But asking for clarification wouldn't be fair to her fans.  After all, this isn't a real news program, its a talk show interview.  So let's move on to an easy question.  And don't you have a book to plug?  
In fact, don't waste your time on the whole interview.  The today show is a joke.  Just enjoy 1:37-2:31.   You will pine for the intellect of Quayle and Bush.
Because as bad as our leaders can be, I am proud to say that at the very least they can put a coherent sentence together.

Rick Perry is the governor of a state that has the highest percentage of uninsured. After the full implementation of Obamacare in 2014, many will remain uninsured because Texas Gov. Rick Perry is not accepting the Medicaid expansion to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Perry runs around Texas telling his constituents that it would bankrupt the state. He says this even though 100 percent of the cost of the expansion is paid for by the federal government for the first 3 years. Thereafter the states are responsible for only 10 percent.
Most of the states with the highest uninsured rates are the ones neither setting up exchanges nor accepting the Medicaid expansion to Obamacare. These states have chosen the status quo. Millions of American citizens that could qualify for healthcare insurance through the Medicaid expansion will be left in the cold.
Make no mistake, the governors of these states have choices. They could take the 3 year Medicaid expansion at 100 percent and then opt out in year 4 if they really thought their state would get bankrupted. Their citizens could have at least 3 years’ worth of preventative care, coverage for their children, and much more. They could make the poor and the working poor in their states healthier.
Opposition to Obamacare has characteristics of an addiction. One knows intrinsically when one is doing wrong or doing something detrimental. However, the cravings make one disregard reality and acquiesce to the drug. What is the drug? The drug is hate for all things Obama.
Politics is a blood sport. Politicians and parties attempt to get an advantage at every turn. That is okay as long as it does not materially or deliberately affect the overall well-being of the constituent.
There are many stories detailing the plight of the poor whose only recourse is the emergency room. They get to the emergency rooms only to be stabilized and not really diagnosed in detail. Generally, not until it is too late do they get care at a point when it is most expensive and deadly. One of the most gut-wrenching stories was detailed by a Galveston, Texas, medical student where she literally watched a patient die over a few months. The patient died not because they could not help his cancer, but because he was uninsured.
There are so many real stories out there that every politician opposing Obamacare has access to. They instead promote stories that are generally debunked soon after they are released to the public. They choose to continue promoting stories they know are debunked.
More on these Obamacare lies below the fold.


Lying about real life stories is not enough for those opposing Obamacare. The Kaiser Family Foundation stated that since the inception of Obamacare, national spending on health care experienced the lowest rate of growth ever since the federal government began taking these statistics. No one knows for sure how much of this can be attributed to Obamacare. One fact is that many specifics like reducing readmissions which is encouraged by Obamacare, has effected some quantifiable cost reductions. None of this matters to the politicians opposing Obamacare.
Americans are busy. For their own cultural reasons they may be predisposed to watch one channel over another. If Fox News and to some extent CNN is promoting the verifiable lies of these politicians by given them a platform where they spew the lies and misinformation mostly unchallenged, how can that American citizen help being confused. Is traditional media not the arbiter of truth? Don’t they work for every American citizen to ensure they are not misled by government? The answer is simple. The traditional media does not work for the American citizen. The traditional media cannot be trusted. Much of the traditional media is nothing but a conduit or the propaganda arm of the American plutocracy.
When does lying and misinforming make the leap from hard nose political blood sport to immoral and evil? When politicians and their supporters lie and misinforms at the detriment of one’s health or life.
It is immoral and evil to encourage young people to forego insurance when you have no intentions of being there if they get sick or get into an accident. It is immoral and evil to build websites that trick citizens into accessing them while providing them with misleading information that dissuades them from getting the health care they need. It is evil and immoral to create false stories mimicking real people’s circumstances in an attempt to curtail the number of enrollees to Obamacare.
The president in his most recent policy speech implies that his last three years will be focused on inequality and every citizen’s access to success. The pope has been more vocal in calling out the ills of trickle-down economics and unfettered capitalism. Obamacare is a piece of one of the legs on the stool that will lift all citizens. You cannot have access to success if you are sick and without insurance or bankrupted by getting sick. You cannot have access to success if those that purport to care are absent or promoting that which will cause your demise.
The state of Texas has the distinction of executing more citizens than any other state. Rick Perry has condemned many thousands of his fellow Texans to death by neglect. For these he did not need a trial. Not providing ones citizens with available healthcare is a death sentence. Many other governors in red states have done the same. What will the evangelical churches do for you if Obamacare fails? What will the Southern Baptist churches do for you if Obamacare fails? What will conservatives and Republicans do for you if Obamacare fails? It is time for all to take stock. When does lying and misinforming become immoral and evil? It is now.

Americans who are fed up with Obamacare won a victory yesterday. The House voted to defund Obamacare while still funding the federal government to avoid a “devastating” shutdown. (I shall not digress, but it’s beyond distressing to hear liberals try to convince Americans that any government slowdown is comparable to “terrorism.”) 
Now the battle goes to the Senate, and we’ll find out if Harry Reid is so committed to the horrendous “Un-affordable Care Act” that he’ll be the one to shut down the government to fund the unworkable Obamacare.
Let’s be clear. Republicans in Congress aren’t advocating a government shutdown. That’s why they voted in the House to fully fund our bureaucracy while defunding Obamacare. The conservatives in Congress are listening to the majority of Americans who do not want Obamacare.
Following the will of the people is apparently a novel idea in D.C. these days. Just ask Senator Ted Cruz and his liberty-loving posse on Capitol Hill who have led the charge to defund Obama’s train wreck.
Those of us who hang in there supporting a major political party with our energy, time, and contributions would like to believe that that party would praise principled conservatives like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee for following through on campaign promises. We’d like to believe that the GOP establishment would applaud the way these bold leaders have rallied the grassroots to their cause. But, no, such praise would require a commensurate level of guts and leadership, and the permanent political class in D.C. is nothing if not gutless and rudderless. 
We’re now, once again, subjected to the “anonymous sources” backstabbing game. The Capitol Hill cowards are rushing to anonymously denounce Senator Cruz to any reporter with a pad and pen.
Welcome to our world, Ted. The same people have been denouncing conservatives like me for years (right after they ask for help fundraising for themselves or endorsing the latest candidate they’ve suckered into paying their exorbitant consulting fees). We can compare shiv marks next time we meet, my friend.
If the Senate doesn’t get behind Ted Cruz’s efforts to defund Obamacare, it won’t be because of any failure on Ted’s part. It’ll be because there weren’t enough principled leaders to stand with him, and that would be a tragic loss, not for Ted, but for America.
More and more Americans are waking up to the nightmare of Obamacare as its rollout continues. Hardworking families are losing their employer-provided health care coverage. Businesses are cutting back their employees’ hours to skirt Obamacare’s mandates. Americans barely scrapping by are discovering that Obamacare has made health care completely unaffordable. Those who aren’t part of a protected special interest group have been left in the cold. 
When you’re living on a fixed income, having to pay hundreds of dollars more each month for health care will cut into your ability to pay for basic necessities like food, electricity, or gas (which has increased 90% under Obama). Open your eyes, America. When the full reality of Obamacare strikes home, we’ll thank God that principled leaders like Ted Cruz and Mike Lee took a stand to stop it in its tracks.
But the permanent political class is handwringing and howling that if there’s a government shutdown the media will blame Republicans for it. Here’s a little newsflash, GOP establishment: Whenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it. That’s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It’s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!
I want no pity. I need no empathy. But use me as a barometer. Over the years, the leftwing media has falsely and irrationally accused me of everything from faking a pregnancy to abetting murder. They lie. Deal with it.
Republicans in Congress support funding the government. If the Democrats block these funding measures, a government shutdown is on them. In the meantime, stop the ridiculous hysterics. Heck, about the most significant thing that happened during the last government shutdown was Clinton hooked up with Monica.
As I said in my speech at CPAC this year, it’s time for the Senate to put itself on Cruz Control.
Ignore the peanut gallery pundits. They’ve written my political obituary so many times, I’m practically Lazarus. Now they’re trying to destroy Ted Cruz. Good luck with that, you weasels. Texans are just as tough as Alaskans. Smaller, but just as tough.
But here’s the important thing that none of these establishment backstabbers understand. It’s not the messenger that matters. It’s the message. You can try to take out someone like Ted Cruz, but that won’t stop the message from catching fire. The message is liberty, and it’s been resounding ever since a band of patriots dumped tea in Boston harbor.
The message only grows stronger. The grassroots is bigger than any one person. We the People will rise up, and we will make our voices heard. Right now, Ted Cruz is speaking for us in this Obamacare fight. God bless him for it.
Hang in there, Ted and Mike. You have millions of supporters among ordinary hardworking Americans. We support you because you don’t shy away from the fray. May your colleagues in the Senate gain the wisdom to support your excellent efforts so that you can see that the view is better from inside the bus than under it.
Oh, and a little reminder to Republican senators up for re-election in 2014: Moose season ends soon, allowing more time on one’s hands. So, we’ll be watching your votes very carefully this week."

Fox News Nation strikes again.



Fox News Nation strikes again.

Sean Hannity has been following the Ted Cruz ""Obamacare is ruining all our lives"" on his Fox show, reinforcing the baseless belief in most Fox viewers that the law is somehow going to throw them to the health insurance wolves. That's despite the fact that the Fox demographic is pretty much all on Medicare. But Fox exists to reinforce Republican lies, so that's what they've been doing. Salon's Eric Stern happened to catch Hannity in the act, featuring four couples who swore they had been hurt by Obamacare, and decided to do a little fact checking. Debunking Hannity turned out to be ""appallingly easy"" for Stern when he conducted follow up interviews Hannity's guests.
First up was Paul Cox of Leicester, North Carolina, and his wife Michelle. They told Hannity that they have had to cut the hours of their employees in their construction business because they couldn't afford to insure them.
Obamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? “Well,” he said, “I haven’t been forced to do so, it’s just that I’ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.” What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he’d call me back. He never did.
Actually, Cox could be getting a tax credit under Obamacare to help provide insurance to his four employees. I think he probably doesn't care as much about his employees' well-being as he wanted the Fox audience to believe. The only requirement for Cox under the law is that he informs his employees of the existence of the new health insurance exchange.
Then there's Allison Denijs who told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums and just got a letter from Blue Cross saying that her current policy wasn't in compliance with the law, so it was being discontinued and replaced. She also has a daughter with a pre-existing condition who hasn't been covered. She's angry because Obama promised that we could keep our existing policies. Stern asked if she'd actually checked out the exchange. She hadn't. Stern found ""that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.""
Not a bad deal. Likewise, Stern found a pretty good deal on the exchange for the final couple, Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin, Tennessee. They're mad because their kids are grown, but they have to have a policy that covers things they don't want like maternity care, pediatric care, prenatal care and so forth. Welcome to health insurance, Robbie and Tina. They're also mad because their insurance agent told them they would have to pay 50-75 percent more for a plan compliant with the law.
Had they shopped on the exchange yet, I asked? No, Tina said, nor would they. They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it. Fair enough, but they should know that I found a plan for them for, at most, $3,700 a year, a 63 percent less than their current bill.
Robbie and Tina need a new insurance agent. The thing for these people who are so mad that their current insurance policies are being discontinued is that they're being replaced with insurance plans that actually cover stuff. That's going to mean bigger premiums for some people, but what Hannity and all right-wing pundits and politicians leave out is that the majority of these people won't have to pay the full bill for those premiums. What Hannity-types are also not admitting is that this is a pretty tiny group of Americans, those who buy their insurance in the individual market and who were already insured. So is Obamacare hurting all Americans? Of course not, just the teeny-tiny bunch of die-hard conservatives who will refuse to be helped.

480,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/09/17/Yesterday-Obama-Was-Not-My-President,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,"Yesterday, Obama Was Not My President--or Yours","
On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s My Pet Goat moment on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.
It was also an act that places Obama’s passivity during the Benghazi attacks–and his decision to fly to Las Vegas the next day for a campaign fundraiser–in perspective. This is a president who, even as Navy Seals approached Osama bin Laden’s hideout, retired to play cards with his pals. The image is of a man with little regard for the lives of Americans in “his” military, or their families, beyond their use as campaign props.
In addition, President Obama–like it or not–leads the entire nation, not just the majority that voted him into office. In moments of terror and tragedy, his job is to bring the American people together, not to split us apart. Conservatives have been willing–eager, even–to embrace Obama on such occasions, as many did after his speech at the memorial for the Tuscon victims in 2011. Yesterday, he foreclosed any such reconciliation. 
What we are seeing is partly the result of Obama’s political foundation as a community organizer–there is never a crisis to waste, so to speak, in stirring up your core supporters against their contrived opponents. But even Alinsky, who had enough sense to criticize those who called police “pigs,” would have counseled against Obama’s speech yesterday, which could not have brought more benefit than harm to his cause.
Yes, Obama did begin by acknowledging the Navy Yard attacks. That is, at least, an improvement from how he reacted to the Ford Hood shooting in 2009, which he only mentioned after several “shout-outs” to his supporters in the audience. 
Yet the speech itself should have been canceled, or postponed. The fact that the White House never even considered that option shows how out of touch Obama is with his basic duties.
A story comes to mind, told by a friend in Chicago who met Obama during his obscure State Senate years. Obama was at a local function for medical professionals, and my friend, having just met the Senator from Hyde Park, tried to introduce him to a friend from the same neighborhood. In the nervous rush of the moment, he forgot that friend’s name. “Well, I guess he isn’t your friend, is he,” Obama deadpanned.
Obama then presented his business card, said, “You’ll be hearing about me,” turned, and left, leaving the two men in shock at his rudeness. 
That’s the real Obama–the one slowly emerging in presidential biographies now that he is safely ensconced in a second term, the one who drops even the most loyal aides when he feels they are no longer of use to him, the man capable of relating to large crowds but not concrete human beings.
Speaker of the House John Boehner said that Obama’s speech was a “shame.” Charles Krauthammer said that it was in “extremely bad taste.” It was worse than that. It was an insult to the victims and their families, a slap in the face to the nation as a whole, a dereliction of the simplest duty of empathy and discretion. He may apologize–he ought to–but what Obama revealed about himself in that moment can never be undone.

MSNBC anchor and NBC News political director and chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd lashed out at Fox News for what he described as “pandering to an audience” over their coverage of President Obama’s enthusiastic handshake with Cuban dictator Raul Castro at Tuesday’s memorial service for Nelson Mandela. 
—
Really? An entire segment on a handshake? Good grief; pandering to an audience
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013
—
The irony of an MSNBC anchor accusing another network of pandering to their audience requires no explanation. 
Todd joins CNN, Politico’s Dylan Byers, and a number of other elite members of the media in revealing his frustration over negative coverage of a historic handshake between a Cuban dictator and an American president. It should also be noted that until today, meetings of any kind between an American president and another world leader were considered legitimate news. 
Because of this sudden change in policy, the pushback from the mainstream media on the handshake has been fierce. Few would question the media’s devotion to Obama and their support for his left-wing agenda. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the media fears the handshake will overshadow the positive coverage the media is already giving to Obama’s Memorial speech.
When challenged on this pandering charge, Todd responded that he does not pander to his audience: 
—
@jpodhoretz I don’t pander to an audience.
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) December 10, 2013

While Todd is certainly very good at his job and much more professional than his MSNBC colleagues, anyone who watched The Daily Rundown’s obsession over gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook or the show’s relentless tearing down of Mitt Romney over rape comments made by an Indiana Senate candidate, could argue that while better, Todd has been far from perfect in this regard. 
But back to my question: When exactly did a historic handshake between an American president and a world leader stop being news? When did dissecting the handshake, eye contact, and body language of such a meeting stop being a media sport? 
Apparently, the moment such a meeting might distract from giving Obama a positive news cycle.

This will be a quick post, I just wanted to point out how the GOP shot themselves in the foot over tearing down Susan Rice.
Obstruction has backfired on them hard this time....
(I did not include links because I'm short for time, but may come back later and add them)


As soon as Susan Rice put her name in the hat for secretary of state, the GOP lunged at her.
They were so effective that she didn't even make it to hearings, she withdrew her name because everyone knew that her confirmation would be an uphill battle and she would probably not get the job, which would spend much of Obama's political capital.
Their agenda was to get Rice out of the picture and get John Kerry the job.
But why would the GOP want John Kerry?
Because that means that Kerry has to leave the Senate and a special off-year election has to be held, that's why.
Since off-year elections are more favorable to Republicans, all they have to do is run Scott Brown (MA's most famous Republican) and get a Senate seat.
The problem is that Scott Brown just recently announced that he's not running, which gives us a great shot of keeping the seat blue. No other MA Republican has the name rec or fundraising capability that Brown does. He is the only real hope of the GOP taking Kerry's seat. This dream of their's is now ruined.
But that's not all...
Susan Rice supported Keystone XL and I've read a few places that she even had investments in the project and would personally profit.
If Susan Rice was confirmed, I imagine Keystone XL would have been as well.
John Kerry is firmly opposed to Keystone XL and will most likely (hopefully) put the brakes on this disaster waiting to happen.
So overall, the GOP's plan to get Scott Brown back in the Senate has failed and now their plan to build a dangerous pipeline across America looks like it might fail as well.
They'll never say it in public, but I bet if they knew then what they know now, they would just go ahead and confirm Rice.
I believe in karma and that what goes around comes around.
The GOP tried to obstruct and play politics to gain political power and it blew up in their faces.
I jut wanted to point this out. :)

            QUESTION: Secretary Kerry was speaking with reporters in Brussels, and he said Tamerlan went to Chechnya and, quote, “learned something” and, quote, “came back with a willingness to kill people.” What did he mean when he said that, and what did he mean he learned when he was in Chechnya?MR. VENTRELL: Well, again, first of all, as I’ve said repeatedly here, there’s an ongoing FBI investigation. The Secretary was simply expressing broad concern about radicalism and not necessarily offering any more specific information about this case.

But this isn’t about any new information or conclusion about law enforcement details of this case.QUESTION: Let me just – because I want to be clear on this point.

Even the most ardent Obama supporter likely believed that the President backed himself into a corner with his “red line” comment. But as ABC News Chris Good stated, “President Obama’s ‘red line’ on Syria isn’t quite as straightforward as it’s been made out to be.”
The President’s exact words were “We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized, ” …“ That would change my calculus. That would change my equation.” The press along with most interpreted this to mean military action. The President did nothing to dissuade that belief. In fact he sent out John Kerry with an almost definitive statement that leads everyone to believe America was gearing up for a strike. In fact he even sent the navy in a poised position to attack. It was all a Bush-like action.
The Left-Wing blogosphere along with most war weary Americans went berserk. Suddenly, the President changed his stance and decided to have Congress vote on authorizing a strike while still reserving  his right to strike irrespective of Congress’ decision.
It seemed as if he was trying to convince Congress to give him the approval in earnest. But even as he tried to convince Congress that this would be a surgical and rather minimal strike, it ‘leaked’ that the strike plans were much more extensive than previously advertised. That would seem like a sabotage of a ‘yes vote’ in Congress domestically, while scaring the hell out of the Russians internationally. After-all, there would be a good chance that the Russians would lose their only naval base in the region.
After the President got back from Russia where the President had some talks with Putin, Secretary of State Kerry had a news conference where he let it ‘slip out’  that Syria could only avoid an attack if they gave up their chemical weapons. Russia gave support to that statement faster than bloggers even noticed it was a statement of consequence.
President Obama never wanted war if it could be avoided. This is the man that said the following in his speech against the Iraq War on Oct 2, 2002.

After Sept. 11, after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again. I don't oppose all wars. And I know that in this crowd today, there is no shortage of patriots, or of patriotism.
What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.
What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income — to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression. That's what I'm opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics.

That said, the President needed all sides to believe that he could be as reckless as Bush was. In doing so the Russians were bound to use any opportunity or window to grab on to. Secretary of State Kerry gave them the necessary nugget.
From dire straits to possibility, was this all luck? For those who refuse to acknowledge the accomplishments of this President irrespective of the head winds from an intransigent and irresponsible Republican Congress, the answer is likely yes. Deep thinkers are likely to see this as a chess match and not simply luck in retrospect.
In one chess match the President was able to make the rank and file Republicans seem like doves, the neocons look reckless, the Tea Party wing seem like flip flopping buffoons all while potentially shutting down Syria’s use of chemical weapons without firing a shot or dropping a bomb. The Right Wing would have none of it. They are so filled with that disease, that mental disorder called hate that they would rather praise Putin as he ‘played Obama’.
Here is the reality; the only ones that weren’t played in this whole scheme were the President and his administration. This President is so self-assured that unlike many he is capable of taking a barrage  of incoming missiles without  responding. He keeps his eye on the ball. That is real leadership. One hopes that as he approaches the twilight months of his presidency, he will use this same technique for middle class centric issues, immigration issues, and other Plutocrat busting issues.

Hundreds of Egyptians – Christian and Muslim alike – gathered outside the White House Thursday afternoon to call attention to the plight of Coptic Christians and denounce what they see as the Obama administration’s tepid response to a recent spate of church burnings.
“Down, Down with Ikhwan!” they chanted in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. Since Egypt’s army cracked down on Muslim Brotherhood protesters, the Islamist group and its supporters have torched dozens of churches and attacked Christians.
Muslim women in hijabs could be seen mingling among their Christian neighbors and joining in the chants.
Protesters later marched to the headquarters of the Washington Post and CNN to express anger at the lack of coverage given to the attacks on Egyptian Christians. Then they went to the Council on American Islamic Relations’ (CAIR) headquarters. Protest organizers consider CAIR to be the Muslim Brotherhood’s “embassy” in Washington.
The sight of hundreds of angry protesters outside its building prompted theWashington Post to lock down its lobby.
Protesters defended the Egyptian military’s decision to forcefully clear out the Muslim Brotherhood protesters staging sit-ins in Cairo, and they chided the Obama administration for condemning the military’s action.

“Egypt right now is dealing with terrorists,” said protester Sherif Mina. “I mean, he’s talking about peaceful demonstrations in Egypt by the Muslim Brotherhood. Is it peaceful when you carry machine guns, and artillery weapons – and all these kinds of torture that they’ve done to the Egyptian people, and the neighborhoods that they were sitting in?”
Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged the popular Egyptian belief that the military intervened at the request of the people. But talk of cutting off U.S. aid in the wake of the army’s crackdown – in which hundreds were killed – seems to have reinforced protesters’ perceptions that the Obama administration has sided with the Brotherhood.
Many Egyptians now consider the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization that destroyed the fabric of Egyptian society during its year in power, protesters said. That belief was proven by street protests against President Mohamed Morsi – the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate – which drew an estimated 30 million Egyptians. American foreign policy should back the majority of Egyptians who do not want the Muslim Brotherhood back, protesters said.
They also called for a secular, free and democratic Egypt.
Basic necessities became scarce under Muslim Brotherhood rule, electricity became sporadic, gas lines were common, and poor Egyptians were being hurt by the declining value of the Egyptian Pound by the time 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to say they had enough.
As the army violently clamped down, Islamists turned to Egypt’s Christian minority as easy scapegoats or accused the military of promoting “Islamophobia.” But that didn’t fly with Muslims who joined Thursday’s protest in Washington.

“All of the Egyptians they are found the Muslim Brotherhood they are just failures and liars about everything they are told us they will do it in my country,” said Nessma Salem, an Egyptian Muslim woman who came from New York to attend the rally. “Unfortunately they make a lot of other things. They don’t want to even admit they are liars. So the problem is all the Muslims, and all the Christians, and all of the Egyptian people they are just go to all of the street again after two years. They told us they do not want the Muslim Brotherhood to control the whole country again because they are failures and unfortunately they are support definitely terrorists.”
Other protesters shared her angst about the damage done to Egypt’s economy under Muslim Brotherhood rule. Given the massive popular outcry, Morsi’s removal from office was not a coup.

“[30] million people came out in the street saying we don’t want this regime. It’s a terror regime – a terrorist regime killing everyone,” said protester Fred Soliman. “They tried to rule the country by themselves and not share it with anyone else, so the whole country, the whole country [30] million people all over Egypt. They say no to that regime.”
President Obama has not mentioned Coptic Christians by name since the violence began. The closest he came was a brief, veiled reference to churches being attacked by Islamists last week. “We call on those who are protesting to do so peacefully and condemn the attacks that we’ve seen by protesters, including on churches,” he said. The State Department has issued several statements condemning the attacks on the over 60 churches over the past week, but the Copts feel these statements have not been forceful enough.
These tepid statements, together with the perception that the Obama administration was excessively deferential to the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in power, fueled their resentment.

“We as the Coptic Christians of Egypt would like to live in peace, would like the Egyptians to decide their future. We don’t want anyone to interfere in our future, would like the American government as well to the media to listen to all of the parties and to decide it by themselves,” said Fr. Mikhail E. Mikhail of St. Mark Coptic Orthodox Church in Seven Hills, Ohio. “…We are here to say that what happened in Egypt is a revolution from the people, not a military rebellion.”
“The army is not going to rule in Egypt,” Mikhail said. “They chose a Supreme Court judge to be in the transition period, and at the same time they have a plan to give it to a civilian government. We want Egypt to be civilian and for Egypt to separate between religion and state like you do here in the United States of America.”"

The entire conservative movement is nuts. Every damn one of them. When even the heads of their big, supposedly serious outlets spend their days doing little else but dreaming up new paranoid conspiracy theories (looking at you, Wayne LaPierre), there's just no conclusion other than the obvious one: Conservatism is just another name for batshit crazy:
Accuracy In Media director Cliff Kincaid yesterday warned that allies of George Soros and President Obama are attempting to pick the next pope. Kincaid warns that a “group of radicals” in the “left-wing lobby in the U.S.” are trying to engineer the selection of Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson as Pope.
Kincaid’s argument boils down to the fact that Turkson introduced a document on global financial policy which was endorsed by Stephen Schneck of Catholic University (along with Pope Benedict XVI) and attended one of Schneck’s conferences in 2011.
Since Schneck supported Obama’s reelection and is tied to the group Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, naturally Kincaid has arrived at the conclusion that Soros is plotting to pick the next pope in order to “use the Vatican in a global campaign against capitalism.”

Yep. The article is called “Black Socialist Pope to Follow Black Socialist President?”, which is the kind of headline someone like me would write in order to make them look crazy, but now they've decided not to outsource that part anymore. Now, I'm not exactly sure why George Soros (who used to run ACORN, before Agenda 21 installed manatees in all high-ranking ACORN positions) or anyone else would think of the good cardinal from Ghana as the ""progressive"" Catholic choice, much less the fellow who will oversee a systemic worldwide ruination of capitalism (again, you usually would pick someone from Wall Street for that job, or just call in Phil Gramm), but if any of this made sense then it wouldn't be movement conservatism. It just stands to reason that a guy who attended a conference held by a guy who liked Barack Obama better than Mitt Romney must be a secret socialist who Obama is planning in installing as pope using his secret cardinal-controlling Vatican Pope Drones. You'd be crazy to not think so.
Remember: There is absolutely nothing you can say or do that will discredit you in the eyes of the conservative movement. Absolutely nothing.

The “Gang of” 8 grand immigration proposal, over 800 pages, is written by members of the same body that has failed to address the problem of meaningful immigration reform for over 30 years. 
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) stated that he wanted the 92 other members to join in this important debate. In the House of Representatives in particular, the silence of the GOP leadership is deafening.
Look at what is missing in this process: transparency; experts on many aspects of immigration reform; and law enforcement agencies involved in dealing with the problems on the ground. The GOP-led House of Representatives has promised regular order. How much transparency we will see from the Senate is undetermined. Most of all, valuable input from relevant Governors are left out of the equation.
A transparent public discussion is required. In 1986 we had outright amnesty and the promised enforcement of a secure border. Lack of promised enforcement by Democrats got us to this point with a significantly larger problem. Are we creating de facto amnesty again with a rushed comprehensive bill over incremental and combined approaches to the problem?
With America’s burgeoning Hispanic population–the largest block of illegal immigrants–more emphasis seems to be placed on who will vote en masse for which party over necessary solutions for the long-term future of this country. It is a bitter pill to take, with the term “lawful presence” in its prescription.
The recent terror attacks in Boston renewed calls from both Republicans and Democrats in the “Gang of 8” for immediate immigration reform. Border security is key, as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer recently stated in my American Forum.

Governor Brewer made the case for working with residents that live along the border, state police, sheriffs and other local law enforcement agencies. There is also the issue of sending the National Guard for additional resources.

This is not a numbers issue; it is a human issue. We have citizens in constant danger along our southern border. There are areas where a fence is necessary and could prove to be effective. The Obama Administration restricts border patrol activity on federal lands, and the cartels, human traffickers, illegal aliens who break our law by crossing the southern border are not known for their obedience to the law. They cross onto federal land with impunity, and the proper authorities are not allowed to pursue.

The “Gang of 8” proposal so far leaves more questions to be answered than solutions offered. Solutions must include standards, methods to achieve those standards, and metrics to measure their effectiveness. Long-term concerns, such as those expressed by Governor Brewer, much less solutions, are largely cast aside."

We'll debunk the IRS' extra scrutiny of Tea Party groups first. From USA Today:
According to a timeline compiled by independent IRS investigators, the IRS first began searching for Tea Party-related groups in March 2010. The policy underwent several revisions through 2011 and 2012 and now involves only organizations with ""indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention.""
http://www.usatoday.com/...
The head of the IRS when this began in March of 2010 was Douglas Shulman, appointed by George W. Bush in 2008. He continued as chief of the IRS until just about 6 months ago - Nov. 9, 2012.
And yet Mitch McTurtle and Marco Rubio are now calling for the current acting head of the IRS to step down? That is to LoLz
The other IRS employee catching a lot of the blame for this is Lois Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations Division. She's the one who said publicly something like, ""Sorry - I'm not too good at math."" Well, guess what - she also was appointed by Dubya back in 2005.
http://www.irs.gov/...


As for the made up flap doodle about the Department of Justice searching AP reporters' phone records, let's see what Talking Points Memo can report.
Here is Josh Marshall himself quoting TPM Reader SS:
The AP story on the Justice Department “secretly” obtaining phone records from AP strikes me as an unprofessional effort by the AP to make the Department look bad.
If you read the story you learn that Justice is in fact investigating a leak to the AP. The merits of such an investigation may be debated but for the AP to write this article in this fashion would be like a politician under investigation issuing a press release about the evil investigation against him. Everyone would understand it for what it is.
More important it is clear to anyone who understands what happens in this type of investigation that the Justice Department subpoenaed phone records. Those records came from the phone company not from AP. They relate to dates and times of phone calls not content. Under the law such a subpoena is perfectly proper and under the law Justice and the phone company must notify the party (in this case AP) that records were subpoenaed.

We now know the Boston Marathon terrorists were Muslims with roots in Chechnya, the Russian province in an ongoing conflict with Moscow, with a large Muslim population and a history of violent conflict with the Kremlin in a long struggle for independence. They were likely not right-wing Americans, as some on the left had predicted and hoped.
We do not yet know whether they are part of a larger cell or whether these attacks were directed from abroad versus being exclusively the idea of these two terrorist brothers. Experts note that on one hand terrorist groups have put information on the Internet on how to make the specific types of bombs used in the attack, but also say it is very possible these brothers also received terrorist training overseas. We may learn the answers to these questions in coming days. 
Either way, it’s disconcerting that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) was “sharing intel“ with authorities in the investigation of this bombing. SPLC is the ultra-left group that has a habit of demonizing conservative organizations as “domestic hate groups,” but has now been linked in federal court to a convicted terrorist. Even some outspoken liberals take issue with the SPLC’s outrageous bias, saying SPLC is “essentially a fraud.”
Recently, a U.S. army officer used SPLC’s material to say the military should watch out for soldiers thought to support various Christian organizations targeted by the SPLC, as well as immigration-reform groups (suggesting they’re “anti-Muslim”) and Tea Party groups. 
It’s critically important to recognize that there are countless peaceful and patriotic Muslim Americans, and they must not be lumped in with terrorists. But given our history, it’s not “anti-Muslim” to note when a terrorist is Muslim and motivated by fanatical religious beliefs. 
The Obama administration’s decision to prosecute the Ft. Hood shooter, Maj. Nadal Hasan, as a perpetrator of “workplace violence” instead of a terrorist attack–while refusing to give military honors, such as Purple Hearts to those shot by Hasan–showcases a profoundly disturbing political correctness that has no place in national security circles. 
As the recent sentencing of convicted terrorist Floyd Corkins, who confessed that he planned his terrorist attack based on information provided by SPLC, approaches on Apr. 29, it is increasingly important that no law enforcement agency lends any credibility to the SPLC. Its partisan agenda focuses so much energy going after conservatives and Christians instead of real terrorists.

What does the Obama got in its pocketses?
Is it tiny Muslimses?
 

Look, this isn't even funny at this point. We need an intervention. Somebody help this man:
Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)—who has spent the weeks following the bombing arguing that Obama’s “political correctness” prevented the FBI from stopping the attacks—appeared on the Glenn Beck radio show to argue that Holder’s history of defending terrorists allowed the judge to Mirandize Tsarnaev:
GOHMERT: Think about it, when your attorney general spent more of his legal career helping terrorists than defending the country, then you know we all have certain biases and lean certain ways.
Gohmert then went on to reiterate his belief that the Obama administration is guided by the Muslim Brotherhood. “[The administration] know who’s in there advising them,” Gohmert said, “either they lie under oath or they do know the extent of Muslim Brotherhood infiltration into our government.”
No, I mean it. Is there a number we should be calling? Can someone check for a medical alert bracelet? Because this poor man is seeing invisible Muslims everywhere, and in every federal department:
While addressing the FBI’s work in Boston, Gohmert said that it was “amazing” that the FBI was able to do any investigative work at all because, according to Gohmert, they are being advised by “Muslim Brotherhood members.”
He said that the Obama administration is promoting “radical Islam” and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and in the US, maintaining that “Muslim Brotherhood advisers” have made it “virtually impossible to properly and adequately investigate and defend this country.”

He's gone past the conspiracy tubthumping of Bachmann and King—he may have even lapped a few Alex Jones theories at this point. According to him, the entire government is just riddled with secret invisible Muslims. They're everywhere. They're hiding under his office chair, they're in his cereal, they're out in the parking lot right now, letting just a tiny bit of air out of his tires each day—oh, it's hard to notice at first, but you can tell. You can tell.
I realize America doesn't have high standards for electing congresspeople. Or, for that manner, any standards at all. I realize many voters in certain southern states have, in fact, a longstanding tradition of seeing just how dumb a man they might be able to elect to office, just to see what would happen. And I realize that the Republican Party has relied on the dangers posed by purely imaginary people of all colors and persuasions for nearly all of their major policy decisions, these last two decades. But this? This is a man past his breaking point. This is a man who's about three weeks from ripping out his own fillings, claiming invisible Muslims lived inside them and were reciting the collected works of Walt Whitman every night while he was trying to sleep. Help him.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Friday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a member of the bipartisan “Gang of Eight,” urged his Senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the Boston terror attack bombings. After he made the request, he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do. 
“Before I get to the bill, I’d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation,” Schumer said.
But, after Schumer made that plea, he commented on immigration reform, including the specific Gang of 8 bill, in the context of the Boston terror attacks.
“In general, we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here, has their fingerprints, photos, et cetera, background checks,” Schumer said.
“In addition, both the refugee program and asylum program have been strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people in terms of who should and should not be coming into the country,” Schumer added. “If there are any changes that our homeland security experts tell us need to be made, I’m committed to making them.”
Schumer’s comments came after the committee’s Ranking GOP Member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) mentioned the Boston bombing earlier in the hearing. Schumer’s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the Boston attack appeared to be a response to Grassley.
“We also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration, particularly in light of all that’s happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week,” Grassley said to open the hearing. “We are here trying to understand why these events have occurred. It’s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do Americans harm, so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland.”"

493,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/11/12/Horowitz-blasts-left-Heritage,News,Breitbart,Republican,Horowitz at Heritage Foundation: 'The Communist Party Is The Democratic Party',"
On Tuesday, former Marxist-turned-conservative icon David Horowitz spoke at the Heritage Foundation to mark the launch of what will be a ten-volume compendium of his writings on leftism, The Black Book of the American Left. In his wide-ranging speech, Horowitz described his transition from left to right, and discussed the shortcomings of a conservative movement unwilling to deal with the ugly realities of what the American left represents.
Horowitz began by distinguishing the David Horowitz Freedom Center from other think tanks, instead characterizing it as a “battle tank.” He labeled himself “monomaniacal” in his focus on the left and its relation to communism. “There are hedgehogs and foxes. The foxes know many things. And the hedgehogs know one thing. I am a hedgehog,” he joked.
“My parents called themselves progressives,” Horowitz explained with regard to his communist parents. “The agenda was a Soviet America…the slogan of the communist party in those days was peace, jobs, democracy. Sound familiar?”
That was the theme of Horowitz’s speech as he continued: how the communists had taken over the Democratic Party. “The communist party is the Democratic Party,” Horowitz stated. “In The Great Gatsby, [F. Scott] Fitzgerald describes the rich as people who break things and leave them for others to clean up. That is a wonderful description of the left.” Horowitz, who began as a radical Marxist, said that the modern left had learned stealth from their failures in the 1960s: “The left have learned from the 1960s…we in the 1960s didn’t want to pretend to be Jeffersonian democrats…That’s why we failed in the 1960s. That’s why they’ve succeeded now.”
But the right, Horowitz pointed out, has failed to acknowledge that reality. On Obamacare, for example, Horowitz railed against the language used by the left: “single-payer.” Instead, he said, “it is communism,” pointing out that it was state ownership of the means of production. He added, “The left hate the Constitution because Madison designed it to thwart them.”
Horowitz then analyzed what he claimed were the four features of the leftist mentality. First, he said, the left and right are on opposite sides of the “fundamental divide of the modern age”: the left believes that human beings are inherently good and infinitely malleable, and so can be shaped by proper state guidance. Conservatives, by contrast, believe that human beings are responsible for social problems, and concentrating power in the hands of humans is dangerous.
Second, Horowitz said, the left are characterized by the belief that “history is a forward march.” Obama, Horowitz claimed, is a deep believer in this concept, all the way down to his carpet in the Oval Office, which assures those who enter that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice. “Leftism is a crypto-religion,” he explained. “They see themselves as a savior. People who believe that redemption will take place in this life and I will be a part of it, that’s Hitler. That’s Mao…That’s the American left.”
Third, Horowitz said that the left was characterized by “alienation from this country… What weakens America is actually good.” Horowitz cited the Obama administration’s eager withdrawal from Iraq as evidence of that proposition: “Obama betrayed every American who gave their life for the people of Iraq.” He also slammed the Obama administration with regard to Benghazi: “Benghazi is the most shameful act in the history of the American presidency.”
Finally, said Horowitz, the American left “lie. And it’s not like politicians spinning…you cannot be a leftist without lying about the most basic strategic facts about who you are.”
Horowitz summed up pessimistically: “We are within reach of a totalitarian state in this country…These are very very dark days for this country.” But, Horowitz held out hope: “there’s been an earthquake on the conservative side since I switched sides…the tea party is the earthquake. The best thing that Republicans can do is stop the fratricide.”

Pro-amnesty activists trying to co-opt the civil rights messages of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to push immigration reform through Congress seem to be directly contradicting the wishes of the late Dr. King and his wife, Coretta Scott King. Mrs. King carried on her husband’s civil rights activism after he was assassinated.
In a 1991 letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Coretta Scott King and other black community leaders argued that illegal immigration would have a devastating impact on the black community. At the time, Hatch was working his U.S. Senate position to undo some enforcement measures laid out in Ronald Reagan’s 1986 amnesty agreement, attempting to weaken interior enforcement and sanctions against employers who hired illegal aliens.  
We, the undersigned members of the Black Leadership Forum, write to urge you to postpone introduction of your employer sanctions repeal legislation until we have had an opportunity to report to you what we believe to be the devastating impact the repeal would have on the economic condition of un- and semi-skilled workers–a disproportionate number of whom are African-American and Hispanic; and until we have had the opportunity to propose to you and to our Hispanic brothers and sisters, what we believe could be a number of effective means of eliminating the discrimination occasioned by employer sanctions, without losing the protection sanctions provide for U.S. workers, especially minority workers.
While the members of the Black Leadership Forum wrote they had “divergent views” at the time on the employer sanctions regarding illegal immigration, they wrote they were “united in three respects.”
First, they wrote they were united in being “fully committed to the elimination of the root causes of national origin discrimination under the Immigration Reform & Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) [Reagan’s amnesty], as well as discriminatory impact.”
Second, they said they stood together in their belief that “there are a number of effective ways to remedy discrimination resulting from IRCA, without tampering with employer sanctions. Some measures we support are contained in the Report and Recommendations of the Taskforce on IRCA-Related Discimination and in the 1990 GAO Report on Immigration Reform: Employer Sanctions and Question of Discrimination.”
Third, the writers said they were unanimous in their request for a discussion with Hatch and other members of Congress on “the importance of employer sanctions to the economic security of African Americans and Hispanic workers.”
The black leaders wrote that they feared lack of interior immigration enforcement would lead to future illegal immigration, and the hiring of those illegal immigrants into jobs that could be occupied by black and Hispanic American citizens.
“We are concerned, Senator Hatch, that your proposed remedy to the employer sanctions-based discrimination, namely, the elimination of employer sanctions, will cause another problem–the revival of the pre-1986 discrimination against black and brown U.S. and documented workers, in favor of cheap labor–the undocumented workers,” they wrote. “This would undoubtedly exacerbate an already severe economic crisis in communities where there are large numbers of new immigrants.”
Coretta Scott King and the other black leaders added that they were “concerned that some who support the repeal of employer sanctions are using ‘discrimination’ as a guise for their desire to abuse undocumented workers and to introduce cheap labor into the U.S. workforce.”
America does not have a labor shortage. With roughly 7 million people unemployed, and double that number discouraged from seeking work, the removal of employer sanctions threatens to add additional U.S. workers to the rolls and drive down wages. Moreover, the repeal of employer sanctions will inevitably add to our social problems and place an unfair burden on the poor in the cities in which most new immigrants cluster–cities which are already suffering housing shortages and insufficient human needs services.
The black leaders then called for education reform to train American workers for jobs, rather than immigration reform to bring in foreigners to fill those jobs while American workers suffered. “Senator Hatch, we believe that what this country needs is not to prematurely scrap employer sanctions, but rather, we need education and training programs designed to prepare the unemployed, especially African Americans, Hispanics, and others at great risk, to meet the market demands of tomorrow,” they wrote. 
The authors added that while “not a panacea for the nation’s illegal immigration problems, employer sanctions are one necessary means of stopping the exploitation of vulnerable workers and the undercutting of American jobs and living standards.”"

It is rare that a prominent public intellectual uses such blunt language. Here is how Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman summarizes Bush's legacy in a 27-Apr-2013 post on his NYT blog:
The Great Degrader
I’ve been focused on economic policy lately, so I sort of missed the big push to rehabilitate Bush’s image; also, as a premature anti-Bushist who pointed out how terrible a president he was back when everyone else was praising him as a Great Leader, I’m kind of worn out on the subject.
But it does need to be said: he was a terrible president, arguably the worst ever, and not just for the reasons many others are pointing out.

In addition to the usual list of policy catastrophes, Krugman thinks Bush infected us with an enduring malignancy:
Think about his two main “achievements”, if you want to call them that: the tax cuts and the Iraq war, both of which continue to cast long shadows over our nation’s destiny. The key thing to remember is that both were sold with lies.
... their selling of the [tax] cuts offered what amounted to an expert class in how to lie with statistics. Basically, every time the Bushies came out with a report, you knew that it was going to involve some kind of fraud, and the only question was which kind and where.
And no, this wasn’t standard practice before. Politics ain’t beanbag and all that, but the president as con man was a new character in American life.

And,
Even more important, Bush lied us into war. Let’s repeat that: he lied us into war. I know, the apologists will say that “everyone” believed Saddam had WMD, but the truth is that even the category “WMD” was a con game, lumping together chemical weapons with nukes in an illegitimate way. And any appearance of an intelligence consensus before the invasion was manufactured: dissenting voices were suppressed ...
... right there you have something that should block Bush from redemption of any kind, ever: he misled us into a war that probably killed hundreds of thousands of people, and he did it in part for political reasons.
There was a time when Americans expected their leaders to be more or less truthful. Nobody expected them to be saints, but we thought we could trust them not to lie about fundamental matters. That time is now behind us — and it was Bush who did it.

PK is not mincing words.

Today's source material:

Youngest Obama Daughter's Real Name NOT 'Sasha', but Soviet/Russian 'Natasha'...
It was once not uncommon in 'captive' communist satellite nations (subjugated to the USSR) to give your child a Russian name, mostly to show support for the Soviet system and provide them a leg-up in the commie world. But how many (esp black) Americans do YOU know with a Russian first name?
How amusing it is then that the Obamas' last federal tax return revealed a fact not publicly known- that 'Sasha's actual legal name is 'Nastasha', which means 'birthday' in the language of the USSR. And something tells me it wasn't just because it sounded pretty.
Of course it's a family tradition with Obama- after all, his parents met in Russian language class at the University of Hawaii. And WHAT kind of people took Russian in America in 1961...? Outside of CIA spooks, Lee Harvey Oswald comes to mind...

Digging around, I found that there are 37,000 people named Natasha in the US, and since the internet is never wrong, I'm taking that at face value. That means that there are a lot of freakin' COMMUNISTS in America!
When will the media start reporting this name that the Obamas kept hidden for so long, even though it wasn't hidden at all? People are properly outraged, below the fold.


So if he really had a son, his name wouldn’t be Trayvon? It would be Boris?
Obviously.
I thought it was interesting how it was hidden for 5 years... normal people don’t hide their kids’s names.
And they would've gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for these dastardly Free Republic kids!
Actually it's a diminutive of Aleksander or Aleksandra. In Russia you'll find both boys and girls being called Sasha.
I have no idea why the Obama's started calling Natasha 'Sasha' but there are a lot of things about them I don't understand.  

No freakin' clue. None! For example, who knows why I call my son Aristotle ""Ari""? And no one has a clue why we call my daughter Elisandra ""Eli"". These are deep, deep mysteries.
So it's probably because they're deep undercover spies.
At least they didn’t name her Tawanna or Tasheka.
... because then you'd have a real reason to hate them?
Malia . . . Malcolm X?
Sure. You go with that.
Or, you could stick with reality. Your choice.
do any of these people use their real names?
Lets ask everyone named Bob, Bill, Jen, Dick, Mike, and Liz, for starters. Also, why is Mitch McConnell hiding his real name, in plain sight? (Addison Mitchell, by the way.)
Sasha never was short for Natasha in Russian, that part is nonsense. Sasha is short for Alexandra, and Natasha is short for Nataliya.
Then why, in the Obamas' minds, is Sasha the short form of Natahsa? It could not be an affinity for things Russian, since that would imply ignorance.
I think 'Sasha' is simply their nickname for her.

Holy crap, could that be it? Seems like a craaaaaazy theory!
My dog was named Sasha...She was a fluffy, snow white cockapoo. Not sure why I decided on that name...but it must have come from my somewhere in my Russian background. Both my grandparents were Russian.
Your dog was a KGB spy. Admit it!
I’ve been talking that up for some time as yet another symbol of obozo’s loyalty to the communist agenda (as if we needed one).
Uh oh, is someone trying to bogart your credit for cracking this mystery?
Natasha spelled backwards is Ah Satan!  
Case closed!
When did the Obamas change their daughters names from Malaria and Sharia?
A look at their birth certificates should clear tha... what, now they're questioning that too?
Natasha is also an Arabic Muslim name, which means gift of their moon idol.
Make up your minds! Commie or terrorist!
obummer is fair game. IMHO, the girls aren’t.
Sensible, except ...
It was Barky and Mantoinette's adult decision to choose a Russian name for their baby so that is certainly fair game. They made many calculated political decisions including later not using her given name. One of the reasons thin skinned Barky absolutely hates Mittens is that Mittens has 5 sons and he has none.

It is the fact they have been lying about this and everything else since this all started that is the issue.

The White House says their budget proposal, which includes idiotic cuts to Social Security for no apparent reason than to do the GOP's dirty work for them, is ""not ideal"". brooklynbadboy says the White House wants to cut Social Security. Others defend the White House by claiming that this is all theater to prove just how ""reasonable"" the president is compared to congressional Republicans.
I can't imagine President Barack Obama actually wants to cut Social Security. I'm not that cynical. Yet. If this was really about ""saving"" a program that is solvent for several more decades, all he'd have to do was raise the cap on payroll taxes. Right now, earnings above $110K-ish don't pay a Social Security tax. Why? Who the hell knows. But you raise that (or eliminate it altogether), and any potential future Social Security problem evaporates. I'll bet my first-born that the American people prefer that to cutting benefits for seniors.
So I actually take him at his word, that he is simply trying to give Republicans what they want in order to appear compromising and reasonable. Why does he need to appear compromising and reasonable? Who the hell knows, but he sure has a pathological need to appear that way. It didn't help him last time he bent over backwards to make a deal—the infamous debt ceiling negotiations of 2011. Let's look at the numbers after the fold.



While Obama's May 2011 bump in the polls was largely a response to the killing of Osama Bin Laden, his numbers had been on an uptick since April, as Obama talked tough about eliminating the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and protecting safety net programs. However, the OBL bump lasted barely 10 days before the slog of the negotiations started eroding his numbers. We all remember those painful weeks—Obama begging the GOP to make a deal, making concession after concession with nothing in return from the other side. He looked weak because he was weak. And the American people don't like weak. No one does, really.
Indeed, by the time Obama capitulated in late July, giving House Speaker John Boehner 95 percent of what he wanted, he was already at the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, and they fell even further in the weeks after. The White House thought that by looking ""reasonable"" and willing to compromise, the ""adult in the room"" as many of Obama's strongest partisans put it, that the American people would reward him. Well, they didn't. Indeed, Obama's numbers didn't head back into solidly positive territory until after the Democratic convention in September 2012, over a year later, and only after he took a more stridently partisan tone ahead of the the November elections.
In fact, 2012 exit polling confirmed that voters stopped seeing Obama as a strong leader.

Those who voted on leadership qualities opted for Mitt Romney by a whopping 61-38 percent. And yet here we are again, with Obama and his team deluded into thinking people want him to look ""reasonable"". No, Americans re-elected him to protect their interests. Among people who expected the president to look out for their interests, Obama won by a crazy 81-18. Those are the voters that gave him four more years, and right now he's inexplicably failing their trust.
If Republicans are so hell-bent on destroying our safety net, and they are, then make them put those proposals in their budget. Yet even Rep. Paul Ryan's draconian budget didn't touch Social Security. (And for good reason!)
Republicans released their ideal budget. It was Obama's turn to release his ideal budget. Then they'd go to the table to try and hammer out a compromise that would theoretically be somewhere in the middle. But as always Obama negotiated against himself, made concessions without corresponding Republican ones, became the only elected official in Washington, D.C., to put Social Security benefits cuts in a formal proposal (thus owning them), and then ... what?
Republicans dismissed everything out of hand, progressive groups went to war against the White House, Congressional Democrats distanced themselves from the proposal save for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (ever the loyal lieutenant), and seniors certainly weren't impressed.
If Obama's goal was to look weak and isolate himself, generating bipartisan scorn and ridicule while giving Republicans a chance to claim Democrats want to cut Social Security during 2014 elections, then sure, mission accomplished.
If he actually thought he was accomplishing something useful, however ... the mind reels.

Racist climate denier Rep Pete Sessions is the (most recent) scumbag who disrespected President Obama, per Huffington Post. Perhaps the White House is denying this in an attempt to take the high road.  They probably should have said they had no comment though....
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) let his Democratic caucus know last week in a private meeting that a top House Republican told President Barack Obama, ""I cannot even stand to look at you,"" according to two Democratic senators who were present, and confirmed by two Senate Democratic aides who said they independently learned of the exchange from two other senators.
The alleged incident took place in the throes of the government shutdown, when Obama was meeting with different factions of lawmakers to try to find a resolution to the debacle. The White House aide told Democratic leaders that the lawmaker who couldn't stand to look at the president was Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), the chairman of the House Rules Committee, the two senators told HuffPost.
One of the two Democratic senators who spoke to HuffPost said that Reid told the caucus about the incident last Tuesday and named Sessions.

I gave this man $5000 in 2007 and spent many hours to canvass and phonebank for him.
I gave him another $500 in 2011 and again voted for him.
I bought the boohoo story of those meanie Republicans obatructing everything. I bought the story that we ""won"" with the ACA passing and broadended gay rights, but had to give up $800 billion of our hard earned money to bank crooks and let them drive away in their Bentleys to their 20 room mansions because he just couldn't do anything about it-- too big to fail. While us peons were left to fall.
They hoard and hide over $32 Trillion of wealth in the Caymans to avoid contributing to the society that helped them enrich themselves and they cry ""SOCIALISM"" when poor mothers and kids need help to find some modicum of GMO-made, cancer-inducing, diabetes-creating, cancer-causing suppliment food.
It's all a grand game, an act, a nation-sized con job.


There's no Republican or Democrats folks.
Just a giant stage on which a play of deception is played on the American people to believe we still live in a Democracy.
What it really is, is a game of Masters and Serfs.
Those ""conspiracy theorists"" don't sound so crazy anymore to me. Maybe their name is not ""Illuminati"", but it seems ""they"" are really there. In secret board rooms and meeting rooms, conjuring the strategems on how best to extract subservience and resources from the massses.
They get us all crazy about abortion, gay rights, prayer in schools, ACORN, Planned Parenthood, Britney Spears' couchie peeks, Beyonce's side-boobs while they steal, hoard, subvert and leech the lifeblood from the ideals this country was founded on-- a land by the people, for the people. They hit the hot buttons in all of us, liberals and tea baggers alike so we can waste our precious passions and energies in angry food fights about who's moralities are better than whom.
While they surely and clearly turn us all into sheeple...chewing on our artificially manufactured feed, inside our fenced world of corporate retail Disney worlds where they milk us and slaughter us to feed their insatiable greed for more.
This country is so sick, run by psychopaths who worship the holy god of wealth.  They run or academic centers, our government, our churches, our media.
And Obama, after promising straight-talk and a man-for-the-people assurances if he could just get our cash and votes, now turns out to be just another puppet.  Unable to change what is really diseased about our institutions. So it's only two possibilities: he's an impotent president, or one who is complicit in the game.
You know I seem to remember a recent village idiot president who got everything he wanted, when he wanted it regardless which party had what majority. If his decisions made some corporate entity shitwads of money, it got done.
And Obama? Those same entities making even bigger shitwads of cash than even Village idiot.
Follow the money, that's the answer to every question you have about politics and the US government.

TPM reports, in an article titled ""With Traditional GOP Allies Defecting, Big Business Takes Sides With Obama,"" that Big Business is entering into the fray and it is not on the side of the Tea Party.
Having failed to persuade their traditional Republican allies in Congress to avert a government shutdown, business leaders fear bigger problems ahead, and they're taking sides with a Democratic president whose health care and regulatory agenda they have vigorously opposed.
President Barack Obama is embracing the business outreach, eager to employ groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street CEOs to portray House Republicans as out of touch even with their long-established corporate and financial patrons.
snip
On Wednesday, Obama is hosting chief executives from the nation's 19 biggest financial firms. Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to Congress signed by about 250 business groups urging no shutdown and warning against a debt ceiling crisis that they say could lead to an economically disastrous default.
snip
The letter circulated by the Chamber of Commerce urges lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling ""in a timely manner and remove any threat to the full faith and credit of the United States government.""
snip
Concerned, the Chamber of Commerce is preparing to participate in political primaries, protecting friendly lawmakers from conservative challengers. ""Clearly we're getting to a point where we need a Congress that's going to be productive, proactive and create a stable environment for economic growth and job creation,"" said Scott Reed, a Republican political consultant who is advising the chamber on its strategy.

The Koch Brothers do not really represent the one thousanth of one percent who have real economic power.  Many of them are at risk from the destruction of the world economy and a debt default will hurt them.  Thing are going well for the ultra-rich, and they are tied to the health of the system.  
It will be interesting to see a civil war among the Titans of Big Capital.  
Granted, they created the Frankenstein monster, but all the more reason for them to deal with it.  Money still talks in Republican circles and it will be interesting to watch this war.  Tea Party and Kochs vrs. Big Capital.  
An interesting anti-Fascist coalition including Labor and Big Capital.  It won't last, and should not since class struggle still continues, but it could put down the Tea Party.

502,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/18/Why-Obama-Fears-the-Gettysburg-Address,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Why Obama Fears the Gettysburg Address,"
President Barack Obama has elected not to attend the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address on Tuesday, Nov. 19th. Instead, he will be meeting with Senators at the White House to persuade them not to impose new sanctions on Iran, and to convince them of the merits of an agreement that will allow Iran to continue to enrich uranium at low levels. No doubt, that is important–but it is also a revealing choice.
Lincoln’s speech is remembered because it expressed, simply and elegantly, why hundreds of thousands risked their lives for an idea: “that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” When President Obama sought to rouse Americans to support a “targeted military strike” on Syria, he failed to move the nation. Now, he prefers to counsel the nation to accept a weak compromise with tyranny.
The contrast is striking. Obama has repeatedly likened himself to Lincoln, launching his presidential campaign from the Old State House in Springfield. He cast his candidacy as the fulfillment of the promise Lincoln made at Gettsyburg–“that all men are created equal.” Like Lincoln, Obama came up through the Illinois legislature. Like Lincoln, Obama became known for his oratory. But Lincoln’s speeches had something Obama’s never will.
Lincoln’s speeches are admired not just because they are well-constructed, but because they contain timeless principles to which he devoted his career and to which he committed the nation. The fate of Obama’s speeches is to serve a political purpose, then fade. His speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, an appeal to unity, launched his national career. Today, it is largely forgotten amidst the failures of his divisive presidency.
Obama’s address on race in Philadephia, in the midst of the 2008 presidential primary, was praised by Chris Matthews and mainstream media as “a speech worthy of Abraham Lincoln.” Yet just weeks after declaring he could “no more disown” his pastor, the race-baiting Jeremiah Wright, than he “could disown the black community,” Obama severed ties with Wright and his church, the platitudes of Philadelphia quickly cast aside.
Lincoln’s speeches were more than words–which is why his words are still cherished. The highlight of the commemoration at Gettsyburg in 1863 had been the 13,000-word speech by Edward Everett, a rousing, anti-Confederate diatribe. But Lincoln did not distinguish among Union and Confederate dead. All, he suggested, fought in their own way for the same cause. He was committing the nation, and himself, to reconciliation.
Obama has never shown the same inclination to put partisanship aside for the sake of the nation’s needs. He has coveted the aura of Lincoln’s charisma, but has never humbled himself to learn from Lincoln’s example the way Ronald Reagan humbled himself before “The Boys of Pointe du Hoc.” For Obama to speak at Gettysburg, to stand where Lincoln had once stood, would only sharpen the contrast. That is why he is staying away."
503,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/13/Powell-vein-of-intolerance,Opinion,Breitbart,Democrat,Powell: GOP 'Looks Down on Minorities',"
This morning, former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press to discuss the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) to Secretary of Defense. During the discussion, David Gregory asked the liberal Powell, nominally a Republican but a longtime supporter of President Barack Obama, about the Republican Party. “I’m struck when you talk about Republicans as they. I know you insist despite voting for President Obama twice now that you’re still a Republican. But as– as I go through your record on some social issues and even foreign policy issues, I challenge you a little bit to say on what basis are you still a Republican? Do you feel like this Republican Party has left you or have you left it?”
Now, this is a half-decent question, given that Powell has been quite liberal on the issues for years now. But Powell’s answer wasn’t that he differed from Republicans on the issues. Instead, he went directly to the most common liberal meme these days in defending a radical left president: Republicans are racist. It’s a bully tactic that has become all the rage these days – Republicans don’t oppose Obama on policy, and they don’t have a good rationale for standing against liberalism. It’s just that they secretly hate black people.
Here’s what he said:
I think the Republican Party right now is having an identity problem. And I’m still a Republican. I’m a Republican who grew up along with George Bush XLI. I grew up with Ronald Reagan, Cap Weinberger, Frank Carlucci, that Republican Party, the Republican Party of Dick Lugar and John Tower. But in recent years, there’s been a significant shift to the right and we have seen what that shift has produced, two losing presidential campaigns. 
So far, this is a typical leftist talking point. The Republican Party has not moved to the right. In fact, it has moved in rather extreme ways to the left, given its spending record and establishment opposition to the Tea Party. Ronald Reagan was significantly more conservative than George W. Bush. But this was prelude to Powell’s real agenda: labeling Republicans closet bigots.
I think what the Republican Party needs to do now is take a very hard look at itself and understand that the country has changed. The country is changing demographically. And if the Republican Party does not change along with that demographic, they’re going to be in trouble. And so, when we see that in one more generation, the minorities of America, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans will be the majority of the country, you can’t go around saying we don’t want to have a solid immigration policy. We’re going to dismiss the 47 percent. We are going to make it hard for these minorities to vote as they did in the last election. What did that produce? The court struck most of that down and most importantly, it caused people to turn out and stand in line because these Republicans were trying to keep us from voting. There’s also a dark– a dark vein of intolerance in some parts of the Party. What I do mean by that? I mean by that is they still sort of look down on minorities. How can I evidence that? When I see a former governor say that the president is shuckin’ and jivin’, that’s a racial era slave term. When I see another former governor after the president’s first debate where he didn’t do very well, says that the president was lazy. He didn’t say he was slow, he was tired, he didn’t do well, he said he was lazy. Now, it may not mean anything to most Americans but to those of us who are African-Americans, the second word is shiftless and then there’s a third word that goes along with it. Birther, the whole Birther Movement. Why do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the Party? I think the Party has to take a look at itself. It has to take a look at its responsibilities for health care. It has to take a look at immigration. It has to take a look at those less fortunate than us. The Party has gathered unto itself a reputation that it is the party of the rich. It is the party of lower taxes. But there are a lot of people who are lower down the food chain, the economic chain, who are also paying lots of taxes relative to their income and they need help. We need more education work being done in this country. We need a solid immigration policy. We have to look at climate change. There are a lot of things that the American people are expecting and the Republican Party, as they get ready for the next election, really has to focus on some of these issues and not ignore them. Everybody wants to talk about who’s going to be the candidate. You better think first about what’s the party they’re actually going to represent. If it’s just going to represent the far right-wing of the political spectrum, I think the Party is in difficulty. I’m a moderate but I’m still a Republican, that’s how I was raised. And until I voted for Mister Obama twice, I had voted for seven straight Republican presidents.
Notice the subtle linkage there: Republicans oppose global warming, immigration reform of the type leftists want, redistribution of income, not out of principle, but out of hatred of those with a different skin color. This is despicable. And it is a lie. Powell’s statements are outrageous. His statements about “shuckin’ and jivin'”? He’s referring to former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AL), who wrote this about President Obama’s feckless foreign policy on Benghazi:
Why the lies? Why the cover up? Why the dissembling about the cause of the murder of our ambassador on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attacks on American soil? We deserve answers to this. President Obama’s shuck and jive shtick with these Benghazi lies must end.
Is that racist? Of course not. But Powell labels it racist because it serves his political ends. 
Is the word “lazy” racist? If so, half the media hates white folks, because presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower have routinely been labeled lazy. 
As for the birthers, nobody in the mainstream of the Republican Party has ever given credibility to them. Only in Colin Powell’s opportunistic mind is the GOP linked with birtherism.
What’s more, Powell is the last person on earth who should be making this claim. He says that he voted for President Obama twice because he’s a moderate Republican whose party has left him. That’s nonsense. In 2008, Republicans ran the most moderate Republican in history in Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). And Powell voted against him. Why? Let Powell, circa 2009, explain:
And I spoke at length with John McCain about his campaign and I watched Mr. Obama and his campaign. And at the end, I cannot say I was totally colorblind. But at the end, I convinced myself, based on the facts as I saw it, that he was the better choice for this time in our nation’s history.
It is Colin Powell and his perspective that are underlaced with a vein of intolerance. Powell should know better than anyone that the GOP has no such vein – after all, the GOP discussed the possibility of him running for president on its ticket for years. No, this is about liberal bullying and thuggery – claiming that anyone who opposes leftist policies does so out of racism rather than political differences. And it’s vile.

According to new national polling data from Pew Research, the American people have revolted against President Barack Obama’s and the GOP establishment’s efforts to grant amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants through comprehensive immigration reform.
“Only about a third of the public (32%) approves of the job Obama is doing on immigration policy; 60% disapprove,” Pew wrote. “Obama’s ratings for this issue among Democrats are mixed: About half (53%) approve of his handling of the issue while 42% disapprove.”
Obama’s 60 percent disapproval rating on immigration from the American people is an all-time high for him on the issue and puts him on par with former President George W. Bush’s immigration polling numbers. Obama’s immigration disapproval rating has skyrocketed as he has ramped up his efforts to lobby Congress for the passage of an amnesty–particularly the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.
As the American people have learned more and more about the Gang of Eight bill and the effects which amnesty and a drastic influx of millions of new workers would have on the hurting economy, they have grown more and more outraged with what Washington, D.C., is doing regarding immigration reform. In February–before Obama and lawmakers like Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and DIck Durbin (D-IL) began their push for immigration reform–the President’s immigration policy approval rating among the American people, according to Pew, was higher than his disapproval rating. His approval rating on immigration then was 44 percent, whereas his disapproval rating was 43 percent.
Over the next several months, the Obama administration worked with the Senate Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans to develop the more-than-thousand-page-long Gang of Eight bill. The administration helped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush the bill to the floor with hardly any substantive review from members, staffers, the media, and the American people.
In mid-June, before the Senate bill passed and as its ultimate passage became questionable, Obama’s Pew Research disapproval rating on immigration spiked up to 47 percent, and his approval rating on the issue dropped to 43 percent. With the public beginning to turn against amnesty, the Senators pushing for it cobbled together a series of amendments designed to win over extra votes in the Senate–like the Corker-Hoeven plan for their votes, casino kickbacks for Sen. Dean Heller’s vote, “Lobster Bait” for Susan Collins’ vote, and a seafood processing deal for Lisa Murkowski’s vote, among others–and rammed the bill through to final passage in the Senate.
Since then, Obama’s immigration disapproval rating, according to Pew, has skyrocketed to 60 percent. That disapproval rating is higher than George W. Bush’s ever was, according to a Pew chart on page 12 of the report, save one exception: in April 2006, Bush’s immigration disapproval rating reached 62 percent.
As Obama’s disapproval ratings reach all-time highs because of his support for amnesty, Republicans keep the issue alive. While House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) says the issue will not receive any votes in the House in 2013, which is probably true, the effort to grant amnesty from House GOP leadership is alive and well–and likely to continue in early 2014. 
Officials like Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) keep offering Obama cover by continuing to push for some kind of immigration package. In an interview this week with Bloomberg’s Al Hunt, Priebus continued pushing for amnesty.
“I think it can happen, and I think people like Paul Ryan and others still want something like that to happen,” Priebus said this week. “It could happen next year, I don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.”
Ryan is in the process of drafting a bill that would grant America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants legal status. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said this summer at a town hall event in Racine, Wisconsin. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”
Priebus and Ryan, if they keep pushing down this road, face the fate of what happened to Senator Rubio after he pushed for amnesty. Rubio has since backed off the push and publicly undercut the efforts of House GOP leadership to pass any group of piecemeal bills with the goal of getting to a conference committee negotiation with the Democratic Senate–from which a comprehensive immigration reform conference report like the Senate bill would arise. Rubio’s backtracking on the issue, and complete reversal of support for his own bill, came after the American people turned on him for supporting such a plan. Polling data over the past several months showed the once-promising presidential candidate tanking among Republican voters. 
House GOP leadership could technically kill this once and for all by promising publicly what Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) has advocated: that there will never be a conference committee with the Senate bill. However, they have left the door open, as pressure from lobbyists and groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to pass an amnesty.
If such legislation as the Gang of Eight bill were ever to become law, it would be considered President Obama’s signature second-term legislative achievement, much like Obamacare is his first term’s signature achievement. The difference from Obamacare is that Republicans like Priebus and Ryan are helping him achieve it, at least for now–largely because the donor community on Wall Street wants this policy.
Despite all the pressure from donors and special interests to do what Ryan and Priebus are doing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offers a different pathway forward for the GOP: flip this whole debate on its head, undercut amnesty, and make the Democrats wear the blame for having fought against the interests of American workers. 
“In changing the terms of the immigration debate we will not only prevent the implementation of a disastrous policy, but begin a larger effort to broaden our appeal to working Americans of all backgrounds,” Sessions wrote in a memo to his GOP colleagues this summer. 
Now is the time to speak directly to the real and legitimate concerns of millions of hurting Americans whose wages have declined and whose job prospects have grown only bleaker. This humble and honest populism–in contrast to the Administration’s cheap demagoguery–would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. Of course, such a clear and honest message would require saying “no” to certain business demands and powerful interests who shaped the immigration bill in the Senate."

Stephen Fincher, a deranged Republican congressman from Tennessee, is very angry that the federal government is committed to preventing poor people from starving to death:

Republican Congressman Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, who supports cuts to the program, had his own Bible verse from the Book of Thessalonians to quote back to Vargas: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat,” he said.

The program in question is SNAP, better known as food stamps. Fincher and his ultra-right-wing friends in the House are furious about the fact that the worst economic crisis in 80 years has resulted in more Americans needing food stamps. The whole point of programs like SNAP and other automatic stabilizers, of course, is that they kick in when the economy is struggling and people need help. Fincher is shocked and horrified by this heinous policy of ensuring that poor people and their children don't starve. Food is to be earned! Sure, this is the richest country in the history in the world, but if we provide our citizens with food to eat, then freedom is obviously dead.

He fulminates about people who are allegedly ""unwilling to work"" sucking off the government teat with impunity. This is a patently dishonest representation of the SNAP program. Most people who receive food stamps cannot be dismissed as losers who are ""unwilling to work."" Nearly half (47%) of all food stamp recipients are children. Another 8% are 60 years of age or older. The ""working poor"" - people who live in a household with income from work - represent another 41%. Between children, the elderly, the working poor, and people who want a job but cannot find one - someone should tell Fincher that there are still more than 3 unemployed job seekers for every 1 opening - that leaves very few people who can be accurately described as being ""unwilling"" to work. It's also worth noting that the average monthly SNAP benefit is a whopping $287. It takes a deeply disturbed person to crusade against providing this class of people with food to eat, when the economy is this battered, and when the broad economic benefits of the program have been so well established (at least in the reality-based community). 

Now, this would not normally be worthy of mention. Hardly a day goes by without some Republican sadist expressing fury that poor people have it so good. Devising new ways to make the peasants suffer is what makes Republicans wake up in the morning. What's fascinating about this particular case, though, is Fincher's background. 

The reason this is even more egregious than the usual Republican class warfare is that Fincher himself is a poster boy for government dependency. It's not just that he's benefited here and there from some government help. That sort of low-level hypocrisy is almost to be expected from these types. But Fincher has received millions - $3.2 million as of June 2010 - in federal crop subsidies. The people who refer to themselves as Tea Partiers threatened to derail his candidacy over this, but then they realized that they have no principles, and supported him anyway. He's now a member of the ""Tea Party Caucus,"" which, amazingly, is something that actually exists. Fincher's brother and father also snatched another $6.7 million in subsidies as Stephen geared up to run for Congress on a platform of eliminating ""wasteful government spending."" The ""wasteful spending"" that he had in mind, of course, was that which serves policy aims with which he disagrees, such as keeping poor people alive. 

House Republicans are on a mission to slash the SNAP program by $20 billion over the next decade. A Senate committee, just last week, voted to cut it by ""only"" $4 billion. If some sort of vicious ""compromise"" is reached between the sociopaths in the House who are demanding human sacrifice on a massive scale, and the ""moderates"" in the Senate who are only comfortable with letting some people starve, it will not be pretty. This is not hyperbole, either. SNAP really does keep poor people, including millions of children, from going hungry, and it's under attack from ultra-right-wing ideologues. This program deserves the support and activism of progressives as much as any government program in existence.

On December 12th, 2011, Mayor Jean Quan of Oakland, California told 10,000 totally peaceful protesters that they were committing ""economic violence.""
Months later, instead of offering sympathy and promises of a full and fair investigation, Jean Quan made another stunning pronouncement.  This time to Adam and Jeralyn Blueford, not long after their son had been executed by an Oakland Police Officer on May 6th, 2012. She said
""You're probably going to sue me, right?""
Now she's at it again.
Scott Olsen, the Occupy Oakland protester and Iraq War veteran who suffered brain injuries after police shot a tear gas canister at his head, says Oakland Mayor Jean told him he had ""a chip on his shoulder"" at the conclusion of Wednesday night's community meeting on public safety.
The same Scott Olsen who received a quilt from Daily Kos peeps? The Scott Olsen who selflessly helped stage a protest in support of Bradley Manning this summer? The Scott Olsen who stood in peaceful protest beside his buddy on October 25th, 2011, nearly losing his life as a result of actions by Quan's thugs? HE HAS A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER??



J.Quan told me she realizes I have a chip on my shoulder. Insulting, more like a broken skull and brain trauma.

Really? Really??
Mayor, you are a pathetic, disgusting individual. No, you are below that. You are a sad excuse for a turd. No wonder 60% of Oakland residents say they disapprove of your job performance.
Here we see Mayor Quan in action, at said public safety meeting Wednesday last.


Scott Olsen, the person whose brutalization at the hands of her police outraged a nation and was partially responsible for sending 50,000+ people into the streets of Oakland on November 2nd, 2011, is asking a rather important question of Bob Wasserman. He's the man at the podium who is being paid $250,000 to ""solve"" the violence problem in Oakland.
Olsen... asked what sort of example it sends to the community when police are not prosecuted for crimes they allegedly commit.
Wasserman didn't answer the question. (No police officer has yet or likely will ever be indicted in the assault on Olsen).
Quan, shown in the background sitting next to the metal guide rail, is playing with her smartphone or tablet; she probably didn't even hear the question.

Not going far enough for Texas Republican legislators.

That didn't take long. The very same day that Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed a sweeping anti-abortion bill that would close most of the state's clinics, forcing many women to travel hundreds of miles for care, Republican legislators introduced an even more restrictive anti-abortion bill. The new bill would ban abortion from the moment something resembling a fetal heartbeat could be detected, usually at six weeks. It has teeth, too:
The bill will also issue a $10,000 fine to any doctor who knowingly provides abortion services after 6 weeks, unless it is dubbed a medical emergency.
Here's something to know about ""fetal heartbeat"":

If passed—and there's limited time in the current special session of the Texas legislature to do that—the bill wouldn't go into effect right away:
This subchapter is not enforceable until the 91st day after the date of publication in the Texas Register of a finding of fact made by the attorney general that:
(1)  the United States Supreme Court has issued a decision overruling Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973);
(2)  any other state or federal court has issued an order or judgment restoring, expanding, or clarifying the authority of states to wholly or partly prohibit or regulate abortion under the United States Constitution; or
(3)  an amendment to the United States Constitution that restores, expands, or clarifies the authority of states to wholly or partly prohibit or regulate abortion has been adopted.
The big question there is what (2) means, because the Supreme Court overturning Roe is a very different thing than ""any other state or federal court"" saying a six-week ban is fine.
Regardless of whether this bill is passed and, if passed, when it would go into effect, it's clear that Texas Republicans are not done—closing most of the clinics in the state and banning abortion after 20 weeks was not enough for them when it comes to restricting women's right and access to abortion.

508,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/15/Obama-Constitution-flashback,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,FLASHBACK: Obama: 'I Actually Respect The Constitution',"
In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) attended a fundraiser where he blasted President Bush, telling the crowd, “I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution.” President Obama, however, has been far less respectful of the Constitution that Senator Obama purportedly was. In fact, Obama has steadily violated a bevy of Constitutional provisions ranging from separation of powers to specific elements of the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments.
This week, Obama unilaterally decided to tell insurance companies that they could now allow sale of plans in the individual insurance market that Obamacare had prevented, forcing five million Americans off the health plans they liked. As Ken Klukowski of Breitbart News has written, this is a violation of the Constitutional separation of powers: 
Obama’s announcement is a flagrant and undeniable violation of his constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause. The provisions of Obamacare causing enormous trouble for insurance plans are mandatory, and only Congress can change those parts of the Affordable Care Act.
But President Obama has a history of violating the Constitutional balance of powers. As Kimberly Strassel of the Wall Street Journal has noted, he has unilaterally suspended enforcement of immigration law; he has refused to prosecute drug law violators; he simply stopped defending federal laws he didn’t like, like the Defense of Marriage Act, in court; he issues waivers on Obamacare and the No Child Left Behind Act; Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency has attempted to regulate carbon emissions when Congress didn’t push through a global warming bill; he appointed members of the National Labor Relations Board in violation of law; his administration rammed through an auto bailout that screwed bondholders, as well as a slush fund from British Petroleum. Strassel writes, “Mr. Obama came to office promising to deliver a new kind of politics. He did–his own, unilateral governance.”
President Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not extend to freedom of religion – his administration has forced religious businessowners to pay for insurance plans that cover activities in violation of religious precepts. It does not extend to freedom of speech – Obama has condemned exercises of speech he doesn’t like as violative of American principles (see, for example, the infamous YouTube video Obama said caused violence in the Middle East). It does not extend to equal protection under the laws – Obama has personally intervened in criminal cases like that of George Zimmerman. 
Obama’s respect for the Constitution does not apply to protections against unreasonable search and seizure, as Obama’s deeply intrusive National Security Agency programs prove. It does not apply to Fifth Amendment protections against taking of private property. It does not apply to the Second Amendment, as Obama’s executive orders on guns show. And it most certainly does not extend to the Tenth Amendment, which protects states’ rights. 
Obama has never respected the Constitution. In fact, he sees it as a barrier to his ambitions. That’s why, as a senior law lecturer at the University of Chicago, he lamented the fact that the Warren Court “never ventured into the issues of redistribution of wealth, and of more basic issues such as political and economic justice in society.” That’s why Obama repeatedly emphasizes that the Constitution stops him from doing things he wants to do — it’s an obstacle to be overcome, not the greatest governmental structure ever created.

Look, Rep. Paul Broun, we've already decided that Texas Republican Louie Gohmert is America's Dumbest Congressman. You don't have to keep trying so hard.
“There was absolutely no reason, whatsoever, for this administration to block access to the World War Two Memorial or the Lincoln Memorial. It’s never ever been done in a government shutdown prior to this administration doing so.”
There are at least two problems with this.
1. The Lincoln Memorial was indeed closed during a previous government shutdown in 1995. That one was also caused by Republicans trying to extract concessions from a Democratic president. Broun should remember it well, since he ran for Congress the following year. (He lost.)
2. The World War II Memorial was completed in 2004, and so did not exist during any previous shutdowns. While this renders Broun's statement technically true, it is true in the same way as saying ""Abraham Lincoln never dined at Chipotle"" is true. Neither statement makes a particularly intriguing point.
Paul Broun is running for the U.S. Senate this time around, possibly because Paul Broun has been running for things for over 20 years and is bored with being a mere congressman. He is also known for being the congressman who thinks evolution, embryology and the Big Bang Theory are lies from the pit of Hell. Observing that monuments were never closed during time periods in which they did not exist is precisely the level of insight Mr. Broun typically brings to conversations; observing things that are flatly and provably untrue is just the usual conservative model for pandering to the base.

Apparently Boehner didn't want to let these guys near the White House



Apparently Boehner didn't want to let these guys near the White House


So here's the story: President Obama is inviting members of the House and Senate from both parties to meetings at the White House this week. His goal: To encourage Congress to end the government shutdown and avoid a debt limit default.
The president is starting his meetings today, meeting with the full House Democratic caucus. But when he invited House Republicans they couldn't bring themselves to accept his offer without twisting themselves into a knot:
Boehner's office said Wednesday that the GOP leader would send a small group to Obama's meeting Thursday, but not the full invited caucus.
Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said the meeting was only worthwhile if it was focused on finding a solution. So Buck said only the elected leadership and select committee chairmen will attend - 18 lawmakers out of the 232 invited

If you're like most people, you're probably shaking your head at the fact that Boehner rejected a full conference meeting just one day after claiming that the GOP had only shut the government down because Obama won't even talk to them.
But you should really try tearing a page from the ""Both sides do it"" playbook and hail Boehner for agreeing to give Obama a substantial portion of what Obama requested: 18 of the 232 invited member of Congress. That's almost 8 percent of what Obama had asked—7.7 percent, to be precise. In non-numerical terms, that's an unprecedented concession. Surely, the president should reciprocate by accepting House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's plan to end Medicare as we know it, right?

President Obama: The American people elected their representatives to make their lives easier, not harder
This is what it comes down to.
The GOP hopes that if they can make enough Americans suffer it will hurt President Obama.
The GOP has an agenda that hurts 99% of Americans and only benefits the wealthiest 1%. They ran on that agenda in 2012 with Romney/Ryan and lost badly. The American people have rejected the GOP's ""1%ers Only"" agenda and will continue to do so no matter what screeching Teabaggers believe.
The majority of Americans who aren't brainwashed Fox viewers overwhelmingly want Representatives in Congress that will make our lives better, not harder.
The choice is clear, if you want a sane and functioning Government that tries to make life better for the average American you should vote for Democrats.
More below the fold


If you want to coddle billionaires and corporate interests while prattling on about Fox News talking points with a bunch of dopey tea bags hanging from your hate then please proceed, Tea Party . . .
Millions of Americans voted to re-elect President Barack Obama in 2012. Obama won. This Republican Government Shutdown isn't just about killing Obamacare, it is about overturning the results of the 2012 Presidential Election. Millions of Americans voted for a government that makes our lives better, not harder.
This is what a dying Republican party looks like. I'm glad President Obama has brought out the BIG STICK.
President Obama: The American people elected their representatives to make their lives easier, not harder
The Tea Party and their GOP cohorts have decided that if they can make life harder for Americans they can blame Obama for it. That plan IS backfiring on the GOP, as it should.
I stand with our President 110% on this. Republicans are trying to make life harder on the average American. The only thing the American public should reward the GOP with is our scorn.

Liberals have accused Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia of being the court’s resident bully, but when two liberal female Suprem Court Justices–Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan–this week tried to browbeat Scalia and lawyers arguing against the Voting Rights Act’s Section 5 pre-clearance requirement, the mainstream media hailed their efforts.  
In oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder on Wednesday, Scalia made the point that members of Congress have no reason whatsoever to vote against the extension of the Voting Rights Act and that he was “fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless–unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.”
“I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement,” Scalia said
Scalia’s point was that once a bill has the effect of ensuring that minority candidates get elected from “minority” districts, it is almost impossible, in the political system, to vote against extending the act. 
“Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes,” Scalia said. “I don’t think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.”
Scalia said there were “certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now” and even the Virginia Senators “have no interest in voting against this” because they would lose votes “if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.” 
“Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act,” Scalia said. “Who is going to vote against that in the future?”
Sotomayor was not having any of it. 
Sotomayor, as a liberal Washington Post columnist noted, “allowed the lawyer for the Alabama county seeking to overturn the law to get just four sentences into his argument before interrupting him. “
When Sotomayor would not relent, Justice Anthony Kennedy had to say, in remarks directed at her, “I would like to hear the answer to the question.”
When the lawyer started talking, Kagan then interrupted him. And in what was described as a “breach of decorum,” Kagan interrupted Scalia’s questioning to argue with Scalia directly on the bench.
Sotomayor would not let Justice Samuel Alito get a word in as well, and Chief Justice John Roberts had to says, “Justice Alito,” to signal that he had the floor. 
And when the lawyer for Alabama was about to make his concluding arguments, Sotomayor allowed him four words–“Thank you, Chief Justice”–before aggressively interrupting him. 
“Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement in Section 5?,” Sotomayor asked. 
Before he could explain, she interrupted by saying she had “asked a different question.”
“Do you think Section 5 was voted for because it was a racial entitlement?” Sotomayor asked.
And so it went, and the mainstream media that always describe Scalia as “acerbic” for his aggressive questioning did not judge Sotomayor and Kagan by the same standards. Instead, mainstream media outlets like the Washington Post said Sotomayor’s and Kagan’s performances proved they were “ready for battle.” "

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)



Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)

The New York Times channels Senate Republicans to let us know: Thursday's use of the nuclear option ""could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years."" In translation, now that Republicans can't obstruct quite as much in one of their favored ways, they're going to find new ways to harm the function of the nation's government.
Republicans, wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power, are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.
These are people who were arguing there should be fewer judges on the nation's second most important court simply to prevent President Barack Obama from filling vacancies. Frankly, there's not that much more they can unify against Democrats. Oh, sure, occasionally a few Republicans helped break the filibuster on legislation and now they might refuse to do the part of their jobs that involves passing laws—Sen. Susan Collins is making noises about how the nasty partisanship involved in preventing Republicans from keeping the judiciary desperately understaffed might cause her to take her ball and go home join in filibusters of things like the Violence Against Women Act.
That's the story: Republicans are committed to obstruction and to destruction of the government's function. One tool of obstruction has been taken from them, so they're going to wield the others with more fury—possibly even in cases where they think legislation like VAWA is necessary. But that's not about Democrats somehow ushering in a new age of partisanship. It's about Democrats forcing Republicans to shift tactics in the age of Republican extremism we're already living through.

Two days after President Barack Obama signed a budget compromise that slashed pension benefits for military veterans, retired Marine Jessie Jane Duff blasted Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for his “outrageous attitude” toward the sacrifices those in the armed forces have made. 
Appearing on Fox & Friends on Saturday, Jessie Jane Duff, who is at the E7 level, said Ryan, who brokered the deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-WI), does not realize that many active duty military personnel go back to civilian life “broke” and “without a job” and have difficulty getting on equal footing with their “civilian counterparts.” She noted that many veterans have had to leave the armed forces early due to injuries or are suffering from things like PTSD. 
The deal Obama signed includes a provision that would “pare down annual cost of living increases in benefits for military retirees under age 62, saving the government an estimated $6.3 billion over a decade.” What that means is a sergeant first class at the E7 level like Duff who retires at age 42 would lose $72,000 in benefits over a lifetime, according to a Fox News analysis. 
She said that Ryan was “misleading” Americans into believing that veterans were getting a pay increase by using accounting tricks and lingo when in fact they are not. 
Duff, of Concerned Veterans for America, said Ryan was screwing over the types of  veterans who were deployed three times to Afghanistan and Iraq and said it was “outrageous” for Ryan to claim that the benefits were “extremely generous.” She emphasized that not enough people in Congress have served in the military, and they are out of touch with Americans who have served or have family members in the armed forces.
Multiple bills have been introduced in the House to undo the cuts.

My cat is watching me write this, and frankly, I don't care what he thinks so watch away, my feline friend, because I think you're a Republican and I'm going to out you.

Fig. 1. Geoffrey the Cat reaps the benefit of my hard work disproportionally to his contribution while sleeping on my work-pants.
Follow me over the divider-doodle for some reasons why my cat is a GOP mooch...


1. My Cat's Number One Priority is His Own Needs.
Geoffrey has a routine. As cats go, and I have had many, he's the most routine-driven feline I have ever met. He's deeply conservative that way. If I'm not up by 7am, he sees to it that I am and then flumpity flump down the stairs to the door. Out he goes just long enough for me to freshen his food and water, which I have paid for. He doesn't care if I have to pee first, or forgot to put out the garbage on garbage day, he has his routine and nobody is going to change it. The next thing he does is come in and eat that food, that FREE food, and he's smug and entitled when he does it. He then makes a commentary on his human companion:

Fig. 2. After consuming his food with an attitude of smug entitlement, he sends a message to the 99%.
2. My Cat is a Racist.
Geoffrey is an unapologetic racist. Like the GOP with banksters and corporate types, he cozies up to people, even new people, because they keep the slush fund of food, water, litter and catnip flowing like the Mighty Mississippi. But as far as other animals are concerned, if you're another animal and you're not a ragdoll cat like he is, he'll deliver an angry screed and may attack you. I have never seen such rank racism, or at least not since the last time Rand Paul gave a speech.

Fig. 3. The ugly face of ragdoll supremacy.
3. My Cat is a Sadistic Authoritarian.
Geoffrey believes in the death penalty for vermin, but he's not content to use some supposedly humane form of execution, oh no. He is both a practitioner and advocate of torture of the most ugly sort and expects--no, demands approval and support for that by bringing these poor creatures into the house half dead. If he were a member of Congress, he'd perform an execution live on C-SPAN just to make a point.
4. My Cat is a Lazy Bum.
Not only does Geoffrey enjoy an exalted position in the household, he feels entitled to more vacation than he has earned, very much like a Republican politician.

Fig. 4. The Republican cat's natural state of being.
5. My Cat is a Conspiracy Theorist
In the 1960s, a regular non-pedigreed white domestic longhaired cat named Josephine, who had produced several litters of typical cats, was injured in an accident involving a car and taken to the veterinary hospital at the University of California. Josephine was of a Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which had the Siamese point coloration. Baker believed that Josephine was subject to a secret government genetic experiment during treatment at the lab, and claimed that it made Josephine docile, relaxed when picked up, and immune to pain.

Fig. 5. Docile sun-basker or government conspiracy? I report, you decide.
So there you have it, my feline friend, five reasons why I think you're a Republican member of the 1%. The revolution's a coming, Geoffy, and you can't do a thing to stop it.

Further evidence that Tea Bagging Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (R - You're On Your Own) is a heartless Grinch.
An Iraq War combat veteran is hoping for a pardon from Gov. Scott Walker so he can become a police officer.
But Walker is refusing to budge from his practice of not issuing any pardons.

That's right.  No pardons.  Ever.
Eric Pizer returned from Iraq in 2004 after serving 2 tours with the Marines.  2 days after his return he went to the help a friend involved in a fight by trying to break it up and wound up being charged with battery.  He pleaded no contest, served 2 years of probation and paid over $7000 in medical bills after punching a man in the nose.
Now, 9 years later and with an associate degree in criminal justice, he wants to become a police officer.  His felony conviction prevents that.
A pardon would not erase the conviction but it would restore Pizer's right to possess a firearm, which he needs to become a police officer.
Scott Walker, when asked about the pardon request, suggested Pizer find another career (sorry, I saw it this weekend on the tee vee machine, but for the life of me can't find it today).
Another more in depth article can be found here.
It's interesting that Walker, who never put on a uniform to serve his country and currently hides behind the most massive security detail in Wisconsin history while pretending to be ""unintimidated"", would refuse to aid a decorated Marine veteran.  Also interesting to note is that one of his associates is getting out of prison early after stealing tens of thousands of dollars from a veterans fund put under his care and supervision by Scott Walker while he was Milwaukee County Executive.  Interesting to note that this early release was ordered by the state Department of Corrections headed by a Walker appointee.
This one case is being highlighted in the press because this man seems to be someone who qualifies to have a pardon considered.  A one-time offense which, he pled ""no contest"" to in order to avoid the expense and difficulty of a trial isn't part of a pattern of criminal or violent behavior.  That the incident occurred 2 days after his return from his second deployment after a night of drinking.
Walkers ""no pardon"" policy, regardless of merit, is the problem here.  There are people who deserve consideration and this man is only one of them.
Stay tuned for further episodes of Cruelty and Heartlessness, starting Scott Walker, a show continuously running in Wisconsin since January 2011.  We're hoping for a cancellation at the end of 2014.
Happy Holidays all!

Hearing someone cry out in distress is difficult for many to endure. When the distress is caused by a gang with badges accountable to no one it is difficult to protect anyone. A judge made an effort to calm a situation that should not have happened.
A homeless man already in restraints was being attacked by police.
The police response, hide the evidence and lie to the district attorney. Shop owners were threatened not to show security footage of the man being attacked. Responsible citizens gathering evidence with their cameras were pushed out of range to hide the misdeeds of the NYPD.
A seventy year old judge was struck in the neck by an officer intent on hiding the criminality of his peers. The ER told the judge he had a crushed larynx. The police who have no medical license told the DA the judge had a sore throat from yelling.
And from what appears to be standard, the video evidence of the misdeeds was not even considered when the NYPD investigated themselves and found no wrongdoing.


    In the 43-page lawsuit, Raffaele claims he went to help a homeless man in the neighborhood who was being attacked by police.
     Raffaele says he heard the handcuffed homeless man pleading with unknown officers, ""I beg you please stop, I beg you please stop,"" while police assaulted him in front of a swelling crowd...


...He claims police arrived and threatened many in the crowd who were filming the attack with cell phones. He says police threatened local shop owners not to provide security footage of the incident.
     An unknown officer ""charged up"" to the judge, shoved him and then ""using a karate chop-like"" hit him in the neck, Raffaele says in the complaint.
     He claims police refused to take an official statement from him that he had been attacked, and then tried to hide the unknown officer's identity.

Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker made himself a household name when in 2011 he worked with his legislative allies to strip collective bargaining rights from public workers. At the time he said this would help the state create jobs, but later told his donors it was part of a “divide and conquer” strategy to destroy his opposition.
Over the next two and a half years, Gov. Walker worked around the clock to make life harder for Wisconsin workers: killing the state earned income tax credit, using relief for foreclosure fraud victims to plug holes in his budget, cutting the state’s BadgerCare health insurance program, shifting funds from public to private education, banning cities and towns from making their own sick days ordinances, and attempting to end same-day voter registration and enact strict voter ID laws.
He is now making a name for himself by passing the back for his state’s job crisis, arresting people for singing, and for wanting really badly to be president.
So when Gov. Scott Walker, who has worked around the clock to destroy the labor movement in Wisconsin, tweeted “Happy Labor Day!” yesterday, the responses came fast and uniformly furious.

At Working America, we hypothesized that maybe Gov. Walker was confused about what Labor Day was. Labor Day celebrates all that has been accomplished by workers who have banded together for a better life; accomplishments like fair wages, sick days, health care, voting rights, and corporate accountability. Accomplishments that Gov. Walker has made a career of rolling back.
We decided to respond to Gov. Walker’s Labor Day tweet by borrowing a phrase from The Princess Bride’s Inigo Montoya. Retweet if you agree.

National Science Foundation

Republicans finally are doing something about the increasing conflict between science and their own political ideologies and beliefs. They're trying to stop such science from happening. As explained by Jeffrey Mervis of Science Magazine:
The new chair of the House of Representatives science committee has drafted a bill that, in effect, would replace peer review at the National Science Foundation (NSF) with a set of funding criteria chosen by Congress. For good measure, it would also set in motion a process to determine whether the same criteria should be adopted by every other federal science agency.
The legislation, being worked up by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), represents the latest—and bluntest—attack on NSF by congressional Republicans seeking to halt what they believe is frivolous and wasteful research being funded in the social sciences. Last month, Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK) successfully attached language to a 2013 spending bill that prohibits NSF from funding any political science research for the rest of the fiscal year unless its director certifies that it pertains to economic development or national security. Smith's draft bill, called the ""High Quality Research Act,"" would apply similar language to NSF's entire research portfolio across all the disciplines that it supports.

Of course, the Republicans claim it's about cutting waste and duplicative research, and ensuring that the funded science has value. Because it's not scientists who would know what scientific research has value, it's Congress. Which is an interesting position for Republicans to take, given their supposed antipathy to government. Or maybe that antipathy is limited to government regulating the Republicans' corporate owners. But here's one clear area where Congressional Republicans might consider scientific research of little value:
Researchers know that human activities including fossil fuel use, agriculture and land use have been the dominant causes of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere over the past 250 years. In addition, aerosols and land surface changes are also altering the Earth's climate, making it extremely likely1 that human activities have had a net warming effect since 17502. These human-caused changes to the climate system, and their consequences, provide much of the impetus for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) climate change research.
Researchers funded by NSF have discovered signs of a changing climate in nearly every corner of the globe, from the icy expanses of Earth's polar regions to its equatorial ecosystems. Our planet's climate affects--and is affected by--the sky, land, ice, sea, life and the people found on it. To piece together the entire puzzle of climate change--what we know, what we still have to learn and what humankind can do to prepare for the future--we must study all of the physical, natural and human systems that contribute to and interact with Earth's climate system.
As researchers piece together the climate puzzle, they are revolutionizing the way we understand the Earth system as a whole. Researchers have realized that they must reach across disciplinary boundaries to study questions that extend beyond any one field of science or engineering. In fact, because of the complexity of Earth's climate, this research involves contributions from nearly every field of science, math and engineering.

The science proving human-caused climate change is overwhelming. Republicans overwhelmingly ignore and deny what the science proves. So, with scientific reality so consistently demonstrating a liberal bias, the Republicans are trying to legislate that science away.

If we thought Jim Vandehei's and Mike Allen's piece of Politico schmuck pom-poming how DC establishment had turned against the Obama Administration, was bad enough, just read Charlie Cook's latest article. He outright tells GOP ""[a]s a tactical matter, a subterranean campaign will score more direct hits on the president."" Anyone who still thought there is a shred of integrity anywhere left in our corporate media, should erase that from their mind.
Charlie Cook of The National Journal, pollster and apparatchik of the furrow-browed serious journos wrote this in May18th issue of The National Journal:
Republicans would be much wiser to pursue a third option: Dig up as much damaging information as they can about the Obama administration and leak it to reporters they know will write tough stories that won’t be traced back to the source. That way, the public won’t see the GOP as being obsessed with attacking the other side and playing gotcha at the expense of the big issues facing the country—the ones voters really care about.
Meanwhile, everyone in Washington will watch polls for signs of blood in the water, indications that the controversies or scandals—depending upon your perspective—are taking a political toll on Obama’s job-approval numbers.

So the job description for our journos is to catalyze bloodsports. It's not new, but now it's brazen. They don't care if their bias is blatant...



In the article titled Don't Gloat, Leak Charlie Cook tells Republicans how to hide their ""schadenfreude"" by getting reporters who write ""tough stories"" to do their dirty work for them bloodying President Obama up.
But as much as congressional Republicans are enjoying their schadenfreude, they would be well advised to think long and hard about their next steps. Even the most cursory look at opinion polls or focus groups reveals that the public is convinced we have an ineffectual and out-of-touch Congress that spends too much time backbiting, grandstanding, and Monday-morning quarterbacking while the country’s problems fester. Arguably, showboating for the cameras and holding hearings are what Congress does best; the temptation is unavoidable.
This is coming from same guy who on May 14th wrote a piece titled While Republicans Rant about Benghazi and IRS, Public Mostly Yawns"" indicating that poll numbers are showing the faux scandals to be having zero impact on President Obama.
Well, a journalist-pollster with integrity would leave the story at that, right? But no. In this day and age there is no such thing as simply reporting facts and leaving them be. Charlie Cook dispenses this ""advise"" to GOP for no other stated reason than to brign President Obama's poll numbers down just so history can be repeated.
If the facts don't fit your narrative, why, gin up your own ""facts""!!
The lowest week of Gallup polling thus far for Obama was 40 percent, occurring in August and October of 2011. Arguably, he is due for a dip, given that each of his modern predecessors has dropped into the 30s or below. Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Clinton each hit a low point of 37 percent. President George W. Bush’s low ebb was 31 percent; Nixon’s was 27 percent; Carter’s was 28 percent; and George H.W. Bush’s was 29 percent.
Charlie Cook is after all twiddling his thumbs waiting to see which ""scandals"" real or ginned up ""takes on legs"" because ""History says something always happens in the second term.""
Well, in Charlie Cook's warped mind that ""something"" can only be negative which must be induced to occur if it doesn't do so naturally. Yeah...
This is a more virulent version of the diatribe we heard last year in the run up to the 2012 elections, No President has been re-elected with Unemployment rates above 7%, then 8%, Enthusiasm gap, Obama 2008 coalition was a fluke, blah blah blah!
But reading that piece made me sick. As sequester takes it's horrible toll on many vulnerable people who've been rendered invisible; as GOP House votes to deny those same people access to healthcare (however imperfect it is); as the conservative movement rabidly tears our commonweal apart, our Journalists focus on meta, on inducing bloodsport so their little historical boxes can be ticked. Really, Charlie?...
This is the media cauldron within which Democrats are trying to govern these United States of America. PATHETIC!

From our ""see, this is why we can't have good things"" department, citizens of Florida learn what happens when you elect morons to control state legislatures -they pass idiotic legislation.
The Miami Herald and Huffington Post report:
When Florida lawmakers recently voted to ban all Internet cafes, they worded the bill so poorly that they effectively outlawed every computer in the state, according to a recent lawsuit.
In April Florida Governor Rick Scott approved a ban on slot machines and Internet cafes after a charity tied to Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll was shut down on suspicion of being an Internet gambling front -- forcing Carroll, who had consulted with the charity, to resign.
Florida's 1,000 Internet cafes were shut down immediately, including Miami-Dade's Incredible Investments, LLC, a café that provides online services to migrant workers, according to the Tampa Bay Times.


And, how not surprising is it to discover this effort is being led by our top Florida clown-fool, Rick Scott, who ""reportedly called the ban, 'the right thing to do for our state.""'



The owner of the internet cafe that helps migrant workers, Consuelo Zapata is suing the state after discovering that the bill was so poorly worded that ""it can be applied to any computer or device connected to the Internet,"" reports the Miami Herald.
But, what's going on here at Daily Kos? Am I the only one left from the group who vowed we would keep all of Florida Governor Rick Scott's Stupid Republican Tricks front and center until we can throw him out in the next election? Imagine my surprise and dismay to drop by and see this article has been up three hours already with no mention of it here, at my still favorite internet spot, Daily Kos.
When I stopped writing six months ago, in a grand funk of an intense election year-long burnout, I assumed the rest of you would keep on waiving our progressive flag, so, now, I just lurk here, occasionally, while resting up for the next election cycle.  
Let's get on the ball Kossacks! Winning back the Florida governorship should be a top goal, and with such a stellar goof ball like Rick Scott continueing to defy statistics by consistently pulling one boner after another - it should be a slam dunk -if we just keep the news of what these fools are doing in front of Florida voters.  
Don't make me come back up there!
Cheers and Happy Trails from your HoundDog friend.

The fact that federal spending cuts were the primary factor driving today's grim economic growth report makes it clear that moving forward with the sequester's draconian spending cuts would be a complete disaster. This is not something that Republicans want to get blamed for, but unfortunately for House Speaker John Boehner, the only way he got House Republicans to agree to raise the debt limit was by promising to enforce the spending sequester. So now he's in a bit of a trap: He has to defend the sequester at the same time that he has to deny responsibility for it.
Here's how his office tried to accomplish that balancing act today:
""These arbitrary, automatic cuts were a creation and demand of the White House in 2011,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Speaker of the House John Boehner in response to Carney's comments. ""Twice the House has passed legislation to replace them with common sense cuts and reforms. If there was any uncertainty late last year about the sequester, it was because the Democratic-controlled Senate, per usual, never lifted a finger to pass a plan to replace it.""
Actually, the truth is that the Senate has offered plenty of ways to achieve the same level of deficit reduction as the sequester—it's just that doing so would raise taxes, and Republicans refuse to do that. So it's not that the Senate hasn't lifted a finger, it's that House Republicans don't like the Senate's ideas.
Beyond that, however, there's no eternal rule that says the House couldn't just suspend the sequester indefinitely. The fact that they are insisting on equivalent cuts means that one way or another they are the ones insisting on the sequester.
Boehner's spokesman says the White House is the reason the sequester was created in the first place, back in 2011. But the truth is that Republicans were the ones pushing for the massive spending cuts—the president was trying to figure out how to keep the government running the face of GOP obstruction, and the sequester is what we ended up with.
That being said, what difference does it make who came up with the idea in 2011? It's 2013: What matters is what happens now. The GOP has within its power the ability to put aside the sequester—if it so chooses. If it doesn't, the most logical explanation is that John Boehner was telling the truth when he said this in August of 2011 after passing the debt ceiling deal that created the sequester in the first place:
When you look at this final agreement that we came to with the White House, I got 98 percent of what I wanted. I'm pretty happy.
Republicans created our fiscal nightmare. They can still fix it, or at least get out of the way, but the clock is ticking.

525,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/11/25/Report-McConnell-Targets-Nebraska-Conservative-Senate-Candidate,other,Breitbart,Democrat,Report: McConnell Targets Nebraska Conservative Candidate Ben Sasse,"

After the Senate Conservative Fund (SCF) endorsed Matt Bevin, the Tea Party challenger to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), McConnell has reportedly gone on a rampage against SCF allies and the conservative candidates it has endorsed. 
Most recently, McConnell reportedly directed his anger at Nebraska conservative Senate candidate Ben Sasse, whom the SCF has endorsed in the open primary.
According to National Review, on November 12, “Sasse walked into Mitch McConnell’s office to clear the air” and let him know he never intended to oppose McConnell’s leadership, but McConnell was having none of it. The outlet notes that McConnell’s incident with Sasse in his war with SCF is “notable” because “it involves an attractive, promising candidate in an open primary as collateral damage in the intramural fight.”
Josh Holmes, McConnell’s top adviser, “privately told friends afterward it was the most uncomfortable meeting he’d been in”; Sasse reportedly turned to Holmes when he walked out of meeting and said, “That didn’t go well!”
McConnell reportedly “lit into” and grilled Sasse about “exactly when Sasse had first interacted with Matt Hoskins, the hard-charging executive director of SCF” who is “working to elect McConnell’s primary challenger.” The SCF was started by former South Carolina Senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who feuded with McConnell because he backed candidates–like Marco Rubio and Rand Paul–that went up against McConnell’s handpicked candidates in Republican primaries.
McConnell reportedly asked Sasse about the YouTube video (embedded below) that was highlighted on the Drudge Report in September in which Sasse said it was time for “every Republican in Washington, starting with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, to show some actual leadership.”
In that video, Sasse also ripped Washington’s permanent political class, saying that elected officials are not kings and the American people are not “peasants.” He said there is not “one set of rules for the Washington elite and another for the masses” and called on McConnell to show leadership and give up his Obamacare subsidies. The outlet also reported that “the bad blood between Sasse and McConnell escalated” when Sasse met with National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) political director Ward Baker. 
McConnell, along with the Republican establishment like the NRSC, is mounting an organized effort against conservatives and Tea Partiers. For instance, McConnell, as Breitbart News reported, said he would like to punch the SCF “in the nose” on a conference call with donors of Karl Rove’s political group on October 30. McConnell has taken steps to put his words into action; National Review reported that “pressure from McConnell allies convinced SCF’s bookkeeper, Lisa Lisker, to part ways with the group,” even though “Lisker has previously worked for Republican candidates locked in tense primary elections without incident.” McConnell has been accused of “bullying” the bookkeeper. 
Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, in response to McConnell’s hostile words, told Breitbart News, “Why would Senator Mitch McConnell want to ‘punch in the nose’ the millions of patriotic moms, grandmoms and veterans who stand up for America through the Tea Party and groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund?”
“The people supporting SCF are the same people going to Tea Party meetings and rallies across the country. We elect our representatives to represent us, not to threaten us with physical violence during secret meetings with Karl Rove’s friends,” she told Breitbart’s Matthew Boyle. She added that “everything” the Tea Party said “about Obamacare turned out to be true.”
She continued, “If they’ve got so much fight in them, then where were they when we needed them to stand up and fight against Obamacare?” Martin also emphasized that the “Tea Party Patriots shares Senate Conservatives Fund’s goal of holding establishment Republicans accountable, and specifically, we shared the goal of defunding Obamacare.”
McConnell has not endorsed Sasse’s primary opponent in the race, but Sasse is being considered “collateral damage” in a fight he never wanted in McConnell’s and the Republican establishment’s broader war on conservative Tea Partiers and specifically against SCF."

The immigration bill introduced to the Senate a week and a half ago would, if passed, allow illegal immigrants to access state and local welfare benefits immediately, Breitbart News has learned. The financial impact of allowing potentially millions of immigrants onto state and local public assistance could overwhelm these programs’ budgets.
Senate Budget Committee ranking member Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) uncovered this loophole in the bill and many others, and he will circulate a memo detailing the gaps in the bill on Tuesday. Breitbart News exclusively obtained a copy of the memo before its public release.
“The Gang of Eight made a promise that illegal immigrants will not be able to access public benefits,” Sessions said in a statement to Breitbart News. “We already know that, once granted green cards and ultimately citizenship, illegal immigrants will be able to access all public benefit programs at a great cost to taxpayers. We have, however, identified a number of loopholes that would allow illegal immigrants to draw public benefits even sooner than advertised.”
If the bill were signed into law, America’s 11 million illegal immigrants would be legalized within six months, when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano submits her border security plan to Congress. Illegal immigrants would immediately be eligible for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, making them legal to live and work in the country.
As Sessions’ staff points out in the memo, “state laws frequently extend benefits to anyone ‘lawfully present’ in the U.S.” The Sessions team points to a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) brief that details how the only requirement many state and local governments have with regard to immigrant access to public benefits is that they are “lawfully present.” The term “lawfully present” is a legal definition.
According to page 91 of the bill, all illegal immigrants granted legalized RPI status would legally be considered “lawfully present.” That section reads as follows:
”(4) TREATMENT OF REGISTERED PROVISIONAL IMMIGRANTS.–A noncitizen granted registered provisional immigrant status under this section shall be considered lawfully present in the United States for all purposes while such noncitizen remains in such status, except that the noncitizen–
”(A) is not entitled to the premium assistance tax credit authorized under section 36B of            the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
”(B) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in subsection (e) of such section; and           
”(C) shall be subject to the rules applicable to individuals not lawfully present that are set forth in section 1402(e) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071).”
In evaluating whether an illegal immigrant qualifies for RPI status, Sessions’ staff points out, the legislation “explicitly forbids” the Department of Homeland Security from using current law, which blocks entry to those who could become “public charges,” i.e. dependent on government welfare programs.  
“Therefore, when those here illegally who are unable to support themselves are legalized, much of the immediate fiscal burden will fall on state and local governments,” Sessions’ staff wrote in the memo.
In addition to that loophole, Sessions and his staff found several more loopholes that allow current illegal immigrants access to public benefits even on the federal level before the promised wait time of 13 years from the bill’s passage.
In the memo, Sessions’ staff notes that current illegal immigrants who are “granted RPI status will immediately become eligible for federal benefits through citizen and permanent resident dependents, with no requirement that they support their household as a condition of receiving or maintaining legal status.” That means any current illegal immigrant who subsequently has dependent children, who are, by right of birth, U.S. citizens would qualify for federal welfare benefits through them."

Yesterday, in the wake of the tenth Moral Monday demonstration at the General Assembly building, the New York Times editorial board published a short piece called ""The Decline of North Carolina"".  It is an excellent, if short and necessarily incomplete, summary of what is going on here; and well worth the read.
Every Monday since April, thousands of North Carolina residents have gathered at the State Capitol to protest the grotesque damage that a new Republican majority has been doing to a tradition of caring for the least fortunate.
That's the opening line of the editorial, and a great way to introduce a national audience to this latest example of Republican extremism, and to the growing movement against that extremism.


Here's a bit more from the editorial, which again is well worth the read ...
In January, after the election of Pat McCrory as governor, Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then, state government has become a demolition derby, tearing down years of progress in public education, tax policy, racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot.
The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70,000 residents. Another 100,000 will lose their checks in a few months.

I also saw that Amy Goodman included the Moral Monday protests in yesterday's Democracy Now broadcast.  As this movement is building in North Carolina, the national attention it is getting, and that it is bringing upon the actions of the Republican legislature and governor, is growing as well.  This is, after all, not just a North Carolina story.
This is a part of the story that is unfolding in Texas, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and other states where the more extreme elements of the Republican party have gained power on the state level and are exacting laws that, to use the words of the Times editorial board, are doing grotesque damage; and where the people are standing up and pushing back.  This is a national story, and a national movement.  We are bringing awareness to the people of this country to what happens when Republicans are given power at the state level; and we are encouraging them to think a bit more deeply, and to take action.
For more on these protests, see today's diary by Leslie Salzillo and yesterday's diary by MsSpentyouth.
Thank you New York Times and Amy Goodman for increasing national attention; and thanks to everyone who is supporting this movement, if North Carolina, in Texas, in every state where folks are standing up and pushing back.

Last night, Jon Stewart looked at how John Boehner finally lost his cool with the Tea Party, and how even Paul Ryan and Ronald Reagan are now coming under attack by the insane nutjobs in the Tea Party.
You know what, conservatives have never liked John Boehner.  That's why they punished him by making him Speaker of the House for four years.  But you know who they love?  Paul Ryan.  Sure, he was the co-author of the new budget agreement, but come on.  Tea Party darling, former VP candidate, all wrapped up in the boyish good looks of a summer camp youth minister, a golden child whose fiscal genius will lead us to the promised land where Reagan will rise once more....  (angelic music plays)  And he will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.  Although really, for the dead, they're already dead, so what's the point?  It's really for the living.  The dead, it doesn't do them....  My point is this.  Conservatives like Paul Ryan.
12/11/2013:
NICOLLE WALLACE: You just called for more leaders.  Paul Ryan has led.

NICOLLE WALLACE: But you just called Paul Ryan a sell-out! ...
SEN. TOM COBURN, R-OK: I didn't say that, I didn't say that.

You know that Senator who appears to have just woken up on a park bench is right.  ""I didn't say Paul Ryan was a sell-out, I just said he sold out!  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go bathe in the pond in Central Park.""
But Ryan stood fast to his newfound ethic of compromise.
12/11/2013:
REPORTER: You ever think that a piece of legislation that you were responsible for would be called not conservative enough?
REP. PAUL RYAN, R-WI: Yeah, it's a strange new normal, isn't it?  Groups are going to do what they want to do.

Groups are going to do what they want to do.  That is the nerdiest version of ""Haters gonna hate"" that I've ever heard.  (audience laughter)  ""Well, ah, you know, groups are going to do that.  I believe those with an unfair negative perspective on those events will continue to present to others said negative perspective, regardless of the surrounding circumstances.  Also, fraternal relationships take priority over those with courtesans.""  (audience laughter)
So John Boehner's not conservative enough for the Tea Party.  Paul Ryan's apparently not conservative enough for you.  Who is?
JAKE TAPPER (12/10/2013): Perhaps another warning shot for the Republican establishment.  Texas Congressman Steve Stockman, a Tea Party favorite, just threw his hat into the ring for next year's Senate race in a primary challenge against fellow Texan and incumbent, Senator John Cornyn.

It's been amusing referring to the growing GOP/TP schism as a ""civil war,"" a bit of harmless, needling fun. Reports of ""scattered sniping"" between the Cruz and Boehner camps add a frisson of martial spice to what has been, 'til now, a rhetorical parlor game.
But, in political conflicts, the difference between a skirmish and actual war can be measured in calibers, and a few scattered shots do not a war make.
But when one side starts wheeling in the artillery...


There is only one real firepower in American politics, and that is money. And now, it appears establishment 'Pubs are willing to roll out the big guns in their battle with Randy and the Cruz-ers.
The New York Times reports this morning that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has given notice to longtime 'Pub ad house Jamestown Associates that the NRSC will not be contracting any ad campaigns with Jamestown this cycle. The reason? Jamestown has produced spots and bought time for candidates backed by Jim DeMint's Conservatives Fund, which has been targeting sitting GOP senators with right-side primary challenges.
Party campaign committees, while of dubious value in actually convincing voters to get to the polls, control impressive war chests, and the NRSC's shot across Jamestown's bow is a signal that establishment 'Pubs aren't going to take Tea Party primary challenges lying down, but are prepared to fight back with the biggest guns they've got--the green ones.
Meanwhile, the ongoing war of words between the factions continues unabated. A couple of choice quotes from the Times piece may amuse.
“We’re not going to do business with people who profit off of attacking Republicans,” said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the committee. “Purity for profit is a disease that threatens the Republican Party.”
“This is happening because Mitch McConnell is having a complete meltdown,” said Matt Hoskins, executive director of the conservative group. “He can’t defend his record so he’s threatening and attacking everyone who disagrees with him. He’s so rattled, he has decided to declare war on the entire conservative movement, which represents the very people he needs to win re-election. This isn’t the behavior of a confident person. It’s the irrational reaction of a power-hungry bully who isn’t getting his way.”
“S.C.F. has been wandering around the country destroying the Republican Party like a drunk who tears up every bar they walk into,” said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell’s chief of staff, now detailed to the National Republican Senatorial Committee through the election. “The difference this cycle is that they strolled into Mitch McConnell’s bar and he doesn’t throw you out, he locks the door.”
Stay tuned for more dispatches from the front. Or just wait for the rumble and the smell of powder.

Debo Adegbile, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice



Debo Adegbile, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice

Like a pack of slavering Baskerville hounds, the card-carrying members of ""RRR"" (acronym meaning varies—rabid Republican racists, religiously race-baiting right-wingers, reactionary racist Repubs, right-wing racist rhetoricians, or your choice) are on the scent of their new meme of ""racialism"" and their target is one of President Barack Obama's nominee's—Debo Adegbile.
Adegbile was nominated to head-up the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.
Seems like there is a logic to selecting a lawyer to head up a civil rights division who has actual experience with (gasp) civil rights litigation. Adegbile has it.
Debo P. Adegbile is Senior Counsel to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, a position he has held since July 2013.  Previously, from 2001 to 2013, Mr. Adegbile held a number of roles at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., including Special Counsel, Acting President and Director-Counsel, Associate Director-Counsel and Director of Litigation, Associate Director of Litigation, and Assistant Counsel.
The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, has issued a strong endorsement:
Debo Adegbile is one of the preeminent civil rights litigators of his generation and a bipartisan consensus builder. His experience as the two-time defender of the Voting Rights Act in the Supreme Court puts him in a class of his own when it comes to understanding the application and enforcement of complex civil rights issues. Add that to his stellar career over ten years at the nation’s leading civil rights law firm—the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund—as well as his work in the Senate and in the private sector, and it becomes clear that Adegbile’s skill set, talents, and experience make him the perfect choice to head the Civil Rights Division.
Adegbile’s life mirrors that of the American Dream. A son of immigrants from Ireland and Nigeria, Adegbile grew up in poverty with periods of homelessness to work his way through law school and one day defend American democracy in the Supreme Court.  
Millions of Americans rely on the Civil Rights Division to enforce housing, education, and employment discrimination laws, hate crime laws, the Violence Against Women Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the core civil rights statutes that allow all of us to take part in the fullness of American life. Debo Adegbile is the right nominee to head the Civil Rights Division. We call on the Senate to swiftly confirm him.

The problem for RRR's is that Adegbile is black. Worse—from their perspective—he is black and a veteran of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (who they see as anti-white), and from a birtherist nativist xenophobic perspective clearly not ""Amurrican"" enough.  
There's that surname of his—Adegbile, which is Nigerian, from his father. And he's the son of parents who, according to Richard Cohen, are probably causing a lot of gagging, since his mom is Irish.

Just a few examples from the sewers:

From comments:

From comments:
Shocking animal ooga booga's promoting other animal ooga booga's.
Thought Tom Perez was Radical? Meet Debo Adegbile:
But in the Obama Justice Department, the law is not as important as the cause. And with Adegbile, the cause is racialist.
We are already aware of the animus against Barack Obama's paternity, and the Kenyan father he never knew, along with the birther conspiracy theory about his nativity. So many of the racist depictions of him as an ape, simian-like, or a savage with a bone in his nose, are deeply rooted in ideations about the Dark Continent, used to maintain slavery and white supremacy.
There have been numerous studies that prove having a non-WASP name affects getting hired, an interview for a job, or entry to a specific college or university. Of course, historically that was true for names that sounded Irish or Jewish. I was fortunate to have the surname Oliver, though after marrying and becoming a hyphenated Velez, slurs of ""sp*c"", have increased.
Adegbile faces a formidable array of rationales for the vituperation unleashed against him. Bad enough to be black in America, a child of a mixed race union, and to have a clearly African first and surname, coupled with the hated resume of tenure with the NAACP, and his support of voting rights.
He expressed that support clearly in an interview done at NYU when he was chosen as Alumnus of the Month for July 2010.
Q: You also were involved in voting rights cases with the LDF during the 2000 presidential election and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. What draws you to these kinds of cases?
A. Voting rights fascinated me when I studied the topic in my constitutional law class with Professor Christopher L. Eisgruber. Leaders like Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall knew that individuals’ ability to express their political voices was essential to take down the racial caste system of Jim Crow. So many of the civil rights leaders understood that having a vote—having an ability to pick leaders and to have a full measure of citizenship—was essential to ensuring equality, not just in the moment but in the future. That lesson was not lost on me.
Q: How did you develop an interest and expertise in voting rights law?
When I studied at NYU, I had a chance to take a couple of wonderful classes on race and the law in the United States and South Africa with the late, great A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., and later I practiced with him at the Paul, Weiss law firm. He was the former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He spent his career working as a civil rights lawyer and a federal judge, and was a passionate and unyielding voice for equality in the United States. He was very involved in a number of voting cases and was very passionate in defending the voting rights of African Americans, especially in the twilight of his career. I got to work with him as a summer associate and then as an associate at Paul, Weiss, and through that experience I participated in my first case with the LDF. So that experience set me on a path of not only caring deeply about these issues, but having an opportunity to become involved in the continuing struggle for equality.

Adegbile was exposed very early in life to concepts of justice and equality. He is an alumnus of Manhattan Country School, and sits on their board of directors. The school's mission statement reflects the man he is:
In 1966, founders Gus and Marty Trowbridge set out to create an independent school where equality, social justice, a diverse community, and the inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. would form the basis for childrens’ education. Four decades later, at a school with no racial majority, that dream has become a vibrant reality for nearly 200 students every year.
Of course his childhood association with Big Bird may not win him any applause on the right either ;)
A: I auditioned for Sesame Street during the first or second season the show was on the air. A big ""cattle call"" went out in New York City because they were looking for more kids. Off to the audition I went, and I guess I made it through without wrecking the set or acting too unruly. I filmed episodes for nine years.
At NYU, I distinctly remember taking a workshop from placement services early in my time at NYU. Their advice was to take anything you’ve done that’s interesting or different and put it on your résumé, because law firms get a lot of résumés and after a while they all start to look alike. On the strength of that advice, I put Sesame Street on my résumé. And true to form, in almost every interview, it was a substantial part of the focus. I guess that talking about the show was a lot more interesting than my views on the law or my command of legal topics – I suspect that is still the case. So in some way, I owe my career success to attending that workshop and heeding that advice.

The good news on his nomination and future confirmation is that given the rules change in the U.S. Senate, he may not be blocked. We should help make that happen.
For those of you planning to attend Netroots Nation in Detroit in 2014 and interested in hearing more from him, he is scheduled to be on a panel. Here's hoping his bio posted on the NN website will have a new addition—Debo Adegbile, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice.

531,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/05/19/Fed-court-signals-AZ-Drivers-license,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Federal Court Signals AZ's Denial of Driver's License for Illegals in Trouble,"

U.S. District Judge David Campbell handed both sides a partial victory at the first stage in a case challenging Arizona Governor Jan Brewer’s executive order that her state will not issue driver’s licenses to illegal aliens allowed to stay in this country temporarily under President Barack Obama’s amnesty program of not pursuing deportation for many illegal aliens. But the judge also signaled that Brewer was likely to lose this case in the end, and these illegal aliens will end up with Arizona licenses. 
In 2012 Obama issued an executive order creating his temporary amnesty program. After Congress refused to pass Obama’s proposed DREAM Act on enact an immigration bill granting amnesty to millions of foreigners who entered this country illegally, the president violated his constitutional duty to take care to faithfully execute the law by announcing that he would not deport large groups of illegals that he thinks should receive amnesty. A federal judge is Texas recently held the administration’s actions illegal, but that issue has not yet been resolved on appeal.
In response to Obama’s executive order and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano’s subsequent halting of deportations, Brewer issued an order to the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles ordering them to stop accepting federal documents from those illegal aliens granted temporary amnesty for purposes of issuing driver’s licenses. An advocacy group for illegal aliens filed a lawsuit challenging Brewer’s actions in Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer. 
Brewer filed a motion to dismiss the suit, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Brewer’s actions while the lawsuit proceeds. On May 16, Judge Campbell denied both motions. 
Campbell rejected the plaintiffs’ argument that Brewer’s order violates the Supremacy Clause by conflicting with federal law. He correctly reasoned that Obama’s order and Napolitano’s follow-up actions carry no force of law under the Constitution, and therefore do not amount to a federal law that would trump state law.
However, Campbell held it was very likely that the plaintiffs’ alternative argument that Brewer’s order violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will ultimately succeed. Although he correctly held that the lowest form of judicial scrutiny–called rational-basis review–is the legal standard for a case like this, he then reasoned that Brewer’s order was likely to fail under even that deferential standard when he issues a final ruling on the merits of this case.
Campbell writes:
 “The Governor’s disagreement with the DACA [amnesty] program may be a rational political or policy view in a broad sense–reasonable people certainly can disagree on an issue as complex and difficult as immigration–but it provides no justification for saying that an Arizona’s driver’s license may be issued to one person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status–say for an individual humanitarian reason–while another person who has been permitted to remain temporarily in the country on deferred action status under the DACA program is denied a license.”
The court noted that both groups of aliens have their deportation actions deferred through prosecutorial discretion, both have temporary status, both are federally eligible to work, and both have documents that have always been accepted by Arizona for driver’s licenses. Campbell noted that Arizona asserts four bases for why Brewer’s law is rational, but concluded that Brewer’s order blocking one group of illegal aliens from getting licenses, but not the other group, undermined the argument of why her order was reasonably related to advancing the public interests she asserted in court.
Campbell has the pedigree of a conservative judge. A Utah native, he clerked for Justice William Rehnquist (before he became chief justice) on the Supreme Court. The opinion is well-written and gives Brewer her due. It seems unlikely that he will change his mind later in this case, or that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will reverse his decision.
And so the latest fight between Obama and Arizona over immigration continues.

The New York Times Columnist whom George W. Bush famously referred to as ""The Viper"" (and the author of ""Are Men Necessary?"" to boot) hasn't hit a home run with us in a long time.  Most of the time she hasn't made it to second base.   But today she (if you'll excuse this exercise in double entendres) nails it.
Excoriating the House Republicans' recent ""impeachment fixation,"" Dowd goes straight to the heart of the matter:
For some of the rodeo clowns clamoring for impeachment around the country, Barack Obama’s real crime is presiding while black.
Perhaps the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington prompted her to train her venom where it really belongs. Whatever the cause, there's not a trace of the mocking ""Barry"" epithet she habitually  throws out when criticizing the President.  Instead, she focuses on the sheer rank idiocy of the GOP's obsessive campaign to impeach him, a campaign rooted in principle since he won the Democratic Primary in 2008 but one that now appears to be entering an even more virulent phase thanks to Fox News and right-wing talk radio:
Earlier this month, the president’s motorcade pulled into the Orlando Hilton and was greeted by about 50 protesters holding signs saying “Kenyan Go Home,” “Impeach Obama” and “Obama Lies.”
BuzzFeed had a pictorial on the “Overpasses for Obama’s Impeachment” fad, where people hold up homemade signs on overpasses. And they reported on 100,000 preorders for the book “Impeachable Offenses: The Case for Removing Barack Obama from Office,” covering sore points from Benghazi to Obamacare to T.S.A. screenings.

Her column castigates Michigan Congressman Kerry Bentivolio, who gratuitously advised us that he can't even bear being in proximity to President Obama and is one of the prime cheerleaders of the ""impeachment movement:""
“I stood 12 feet away from the guy and listened to him and I couldn’t stand being there,” he said of President Obama, “but because he is president I have to respect the office.”
Bentivolio is the perfect avatar of the impeachment fever gripping a G.O.P. that’s unmoored from reality....

Dowd's verdict on this sorry Republican strategy is harsh:
Not content with fighting off a popular immigration overhaul or threatening to shut down the government and set off the first federal default, hard-core Congressional Republicans want to nullify the election. Unlike when the Republicans did their nutty impeachment of Bill Clinton — (Newt Gingrich is back, starring in the “Crossfire” reboot) — they don’t even control the Senate. And as David Axelrod told me, there isn’t a “scintilla of justification.”
Of course she's right. But what she doesn't acknowledge is the likelihood that the Republicans know full well their impeachment talk is hollow, yet they persist in it to satisfy their core constituents who apparently thrive on a diet of racism and bile. Had she faced up to that uncomfortable reality, this column could have been a classic.  But God knows we can't blame the constituents for the behavior of their Representatives, can we?
Still, she does get the point:
The Democrats never impeached W. and they had real grounds: starting a war on false premises and sanctioning torture. “The Republican Party is in a constant struggle between its ego and its id,” Axelrod says, “and the id has mostly won out lately.”
It isn’t the president who should leave. It’s the misguided lawmakers trying to drive him out.  

Except they're not ""misguided."" They're just playing to the impotent rage of the people who voted for them.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)



Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)

The New York Times channels Senate Republicans to let us know: Thursday's use of the nuclear option ""could usher in an era of rank partisan warfare beyond even what Americans have seen in the past five years."" In translation, now that Republicans can't obstruct quite as much in one of their favored ways, they're going to find new ways to harm the function of the nation's government.
Republicans, wounded and eager to show they have not been stripped of all power, are far more likely to unify against the Democrats who humiliated them in such dramatic fashion.
These are people who were arguing there should be fewer judges on the nation's second most important court simply to prevent President Barack Obama from filling vacancies. Frankly, there's not that much more they can unify against Democrats. Oh, sure, occasionally a few Republicans helped break the filibuster on legislation and now they might refuse to do the part of their jobs that involves passing laws—Sen. Susan Collins is making noises about how the nasty partisanship involved in preventing Republicans from keeping the judiciary desperately understaffed might cause her to take her ball and go home join in filibusters of things like the Violence Against Women Act.
That's the story: Republicans are committed to obstruction and to destruction of the government's function. One tool of obstruction has been taken from them, so they're going to wield the others with more fury—possibly even in cases where they think legislation like VAWA is necessary. But that's not about Democrats somehow ushering in a new age of partisanship. It's about Democrats forcing Republicans to shift tactics in the age of Republican extremism we're already living through.

As you all know, I absolutely cannot stand the Washington Beltway insider establishment. They all make me sick. Even the handful of people that I know personally who are a part of it, they make me sick too. I'm talking about all of them: Congressional staff, media people, lawyers, lobbyists, administration officials, campaign consultants, think tank scholars, bureaucrats...all of them. They're all horrible, disgusting people. I actually like Wall Street people, with whom I also familiar, more than I like Beltway people. At least with Wall Streeters the motivations are clear. Spend some time around both groups and you'll agree.
But when I read this piece by quintessential beltway insiders Mike Allen and Jim Vandehei attempt at self-reporting, the level bile building up in my throat couldn't be kept down by my morning coffee. Just listen to them:
Talk about incestuous: A top Obama official cashes in with a top corporation with the help of a top Washington fixer and gets top-shelf treatment from one of Washington’s top journalists (who also happens to be the co-byline on this piece.)
Yes, its so awful you want to throw your tablet at some ""strategist"" right? Well hold on to it because it gets much, much worse:
Haddad may regret it, too. Leibovich asked a lot of questions about how the former TV producer courts the powerful. He focused on Haddad’s relentless promotion and fundraising for CURE (Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy), founded by Susan Axelrod, the wife of David Axelrod. Leibovich portrays this as a blatant effort to curry favor – a bald execution of the theory that you build connections to the powerful by finding out what interests the people around them.
David Axelrod is distressed by the expected portrayal and told us: “Tammy has been a great friend to Susan and me, and I think very sincere about it. She has never asked me for anything in return.”
Haddad did not give Leibovich a formal interview but the two recently had a clear-the-air lunch at The Jefferson hotel. Leibovich seemed suspicious of Haddad’s presence on Air Force One when Jon Meacham of Newsweek, then one of her clients, had an interview with President Obama. But Haddad has told friends it’s perfectly normal to accompany clients to interviews she has helped arrange. She declined to comment.
For what it’s worth, Haddad is a friend who has thrown parties for us. Come to think of it, she has thrown parties for virtually every other person and cause we know.

This doesn't deserve analysis. This deserves nothing but the purest forms of hateful insults.
These people are the problem in our nations Capitol. Washington has come to be dominated by an elite class of tightly connected social-climbing nihilists. They promote inertia, because inertia is their gravy train. Their kids go to the right private schools, their salaries paid by an ever growing list of people who move effortlessly between government, the press, and corporate employment justified by their expensive connections made in college, thanks to their parents...who are also people just like them.
If you decide you want to be civic minded and run for office, you too will run into these people. They'll be sent to you by a party campaign committee. Then, if you can get successfully trained by handlers (same people) to say the right things, they'll use their connections to get you interviews with the media, who are also the same people. Then you can spend many hours of your day calling donors, who also have staffs of people who know your people. Then you'll use the money you raise to pay other people, who are also friends of theirs, to run your campaign. And if you win, those people will introduce you to other people who will run your office. And those people will make sure you meet other people so that you get the right assignments, so that those can people can then tell other people that they have influence over you. Because they do. And if you do this for two or three terms in office, you'll cycle through a bunch of people like these whom you will see far more than any of your constituents. Then one day, you'll look up at a committee hearing, reading a statement prepared by your people, telling you what to say and how to vote. And you will have totally forgotten why you decided to come there in the first place, having accomplished little to nothing, while watching all your people get rich in the process. And then you will retire and decide its time to get yours. You will become your people.
This is why all of them make me want to vomit.

Last night, Stephen Colbert laid into Fox News as only Stephen can do for trying to justify why women should pay more for health care in their attempts to attack Obamacare.
Nation, the big news continue to be the slow-motion train wreck that is the roll-out of the President's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, or as most people call it, Barackacare.  Everyone's getting screwed by the website, but the true victim of this health care disaster are America's most vulnerable — the men.
When it comes to medical care, men always get the short end of the long end of the scope.  You see, folks, up until now, health insurance in America has always struck a delicate balance.  Women paid higher premiums than men, and in return, men paid less.  (audience laughter)  The system worked.  But now, folks, all that's changing.
STEVE DOOCY (8/27/2013): Obamacare will have men and women paying the same amount for health care, but since women live longer and have babies, shouldn't they pay more?
DR. JANE HUGHES (9/24/2013): Under the new law, they're including essential health benefits.  And those essential health benefits include maternity, pediatric dental and vision, contraceptive services, and free birth control pills — none of which a young man needs or wants.

(audience laughter)
Did you catch that?  Under Obamacare, men will pay the same amount as women, and yet we still don't get to pass a cantaloupe with toenails through our genitals.  (audience laughter)
Fox Business host and Madame Tussauds' wax figure of himself John Stossel reminds us why the ladies should pay more.
JOHN STOSSEL (10/31/2013): You ought to be able to charge people who use the services more, more! ... Women go to the doctor much more often than men.  Maybe they're smarter, or maybe they're hypochondriacs.  They live longer, who knows?
(angry audience reaction)
Yeah, ladies, ladies, come on.  No, ladies, ladies love going to the doctor.  Who knows why?  Maybe they're pretending they're extras on Grey's Anatomy, I don't know.  They're suckers for that stuff.
And Fox News chief urologist Dr. David Samadi gives us a real world example of the ladies' doctor addiction.
8/27/2013:
DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's not a really fair system.  She sees her doctor all the time.  When was the last time you went to see your doctor?
BRIAN KILMEADE: Two years ago.
DR. DAVID SAMADI: Exactly.  And you?  Last week.
GRETCHEN CARLSON: I've had Lyme disease for the last 10 days, so....
DR. DAVID SAMADI: That's what happens.  So you're basically paying for her.

Yeah, that's what happens.  Women get bitten by an insect, they get Lyme disease.  A man gets bitten by an insect, he becomes a superhero.

It's not fair.  And folks, it's no wonder the brown-haired guy who's not Steve Doocy won't go to the doctor, he hates wearing that cone.

And folks, he's not alone.  The Fox doc explained the obvious reason why all men always go to the doctor less.
DR. DAVID SAMADI (8/27/2013): We're using the health care system much less.  You know, also, our bodies are completely different. ... We only have the prostate.  Women have the breasts, they have the ovaries, they have the uterus.  They get checked in every part.
Yeah, men only have the prostate.  Meanwhile, women are like the mines of Moria down there.  You got the tube, you got the doodads, you got the Chicago Bull, you know.

(wild audience laughter)
You know, you gotta squint.  You gotta kind of squint to make out what's really going on down there.  It's like one of those Magic Eye posters.  They say there's a little man in a boat, but I've never found it.  (audience laughter)
I tell you what, fellas, I tell you what.  As long as we're footing the bill for all this lady maintenance, I say we demand pap smears!  (audience laughter)  OK?  Hey, hey!  It's guy-necologist, not gal-necologist.  (audience laughter)  I say we make them find a place to stick that speculum.  They're the doctors.

Homes sit smoldering after Hurricane Sandy in the Far Rockaway area of New York.



Homes sit smoldering after Hurricane Sandy in the Far Rockaway area of New York.

Here are the 36 votes against Sandy relief, a $50.5 billion emergency spending bill to aid victims of super storm Sandy. It passed in a 62-36 vote in the Senate Monday evening,

Steve Benen did a little math with these votes. In the House, 78 percent of Republicans voted against emergency aid. In the Senate, those 36 votes represent 80 percent of Republicans. The overwhelming majority of Republicans, well more than three-quarters, now approach natural disasters as political fodder, another opportunity to push deficit hysteria and to force massive cuts to other domestic spending. Tax cuts to the wealthy? Those pay for themselves. Rebuilding destroyed communities populated by millions of Americans? Only if you cut other government programs. In other words, the vast majority of Republicans are assholes.
But the king of the assholes, at least on this vote, is Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, number three on that list up there of votes against Sandy relief. Let's rewind to May 2011.
ST. LOUIS (KMOX) - Missouri Senator Roy Blunt says he’s asking the federal government to reimburse 100 percent of the cost to local governments dealing with the Joplin tornado aftermath. [...]
“I’m asking for 100 percent federal reimbursement to local governments,” Blunt said, “They’ve agreed to 75.   I think they have to come to a better number than that, and the right number, I think, would be 100 percent.”

Note what's not included in that demand: offsets.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) must be having a big ol' sad that he can't be in the House voting to repeal Obamacare every other week. So he's getting in on the act, and one-upping the House. He's not just willing to destroy Obamacare, he's ready to take down the whole government to kill the law.
Speaking on Fox News, Lee said Republicans determined that refusing to fund Obamacare was the ""last stop"" before the individual mandate and the law's health insurance exchanges are set to go into effect at the beginning of next year.
“Congress of course has to pass a law to continue funding government—lately we’ve been doing that through a funding mechanism called a continuing resolution,"" Lee said. ""If Republicans in both houses simply refuse to vote for any continuing resolution that contains further funding for further enforcement of Obamacare, we can stop it. We can stop the individual mandate from going into effect.”
Lee added that his effort, which he said was backed by ""13 or 14"" Senate Republicans and a host of House Republicans, wouldn't target popular Obamacare provisions that already had gone into effect, like a measure that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.

Hell, what's one more hostage? We've got the budget, we've got the debt ceiling, and now we've got the mechanism Congress has had to use to keep the federal government's lights on—the continuing resolution. It's sort of shocking that they didn't already get there: It is the surest way to finish the job they've started and to reach their ultimate goal of destroying the federal government.
All because a lot more people will now be able to get more affordable health insurance.

Gary Bauer, while running for president in 2000.



Gary Bauer, while running for president in 2000.

A few weeks ago I put together this handy chart of the various components of the GOP coalition. While we already know that the various factions have their own pet issues and causes, the current GOP civil war is exposing the actual distaste the various groups have for each other.
Jed already hit the Christian Right's whining of Republicans abandoning them on marriage equality. But I want to refocus on Gary Bauer's comments, because they go beyond simple grousing over a wayward coalition partner:
""If we gave our voters an accurate portrayal of our ideas, that we want to cut the rate of growth on Social Security, give tax cuts to billionaires and then the values issues, the values issues would be more popular than the economic agenda of the current Republican Party,” said [social conservative leader Gary] Bauer...
Ignore the fact that there's nothing popular about the GOP's ""values."" Just note how he portrays his party's economic agenda:
give tax cuts to billionaires
That's how we liberals frame the Mitt Romney wing of the GOP. Economic conservatives might pretend that there's more to them than tax cuts for billionaires, but even their own partners disagree. And Bauer can't even be bothered to pretend otherwise anymore.
That's not a characterization that suggests mutual respect and agreement, but one of barely disguised disgust. Theirs is a marriage of convenience—the Gordon Geckos don't care for the Bible Thumbers, the Bible Thumpers don't care for the Gordon Geckos. And now that their collective suck isn't leading to White House victories, the knives are out.
Funny thing is, both those sides are equally to blame for the GOP's woes. Mitt Romney conservatism (aka ""tax cuts for billionaires"") is as unpopular as Rick Santorum conservatism (aka ""hate the gays""). They need each other to amount to something, but that's no longer a nationally viable party.

President Barack Obama built his 2008 presidential campaign on a new brand of politics, one where the two parties could come together in the best interests of the country.
Nothing of the sort transpired, as we all know now. Five years later, Obama and his acolytes can’t wait to trash members of the GOP who dare stretch a toe over the ideological line toward the President.
Two new examples: a MoveOn.org effort to paint Paul Ryan (R-WI) as racist for using the term “anchor babies” in an immigration talk, and Organizing for Action branding Marco Rubio (R-FL) a “climate denier.”
Both Ryan and Rubio have been generally supportive of the “Gang of 8” Senate immigration bill, one that most conservatives have unabashedly decried.
This afternoon, a group of liberal Wisconsinites will gather at Monument Square in Racine, WI to demand Ryan apologize for using an “offensive anti-immigrant slur”–anchor babies–while discussing immigration reform. The petition began on MoveOn.org’s online petition platform.
A press release announcing the protest featured this battle cry: 
As a former vice-presidential nominee and key player in the GOP’s future, Rep. Ryan knows better than to resort to language that only serves to rile up the fringe, anti-immigrant segment of his party. If he wants to attract Republican voters to truly bipartisan reform efforts, this isn’t the way to do it.
That comes on the heels of Obama’s constant campaign arm saying Rubio publicly mocked basic science by not falling in lockstep surrounding the left’s global warming hysteria. Here’s some of the text Organizing for Action sent to its members:
If we want to make progress on climate change, we need everyone in Congress on board for a solution. It’s our job to show them there’s a price to pay for being a climate denier.
Hope and Change? More like Chicago-style politics powered by a dash of Thought Police enforcement."

It's all a grand game, an act, a nation-sized con job.


There's no Republican or Democrats folks.
Just a giant stage on which a play of deception is played on the American people to believe we still live in a Democracy.
What it really is, is a game of Masters and Serfs.
Those ""conspiracy theorists"" don't sound so crazy anymore to me. Maybe their name is not ""Illuminati"", but it seems ""they"" are really there. In secret board rooms and meeting rooms, conjuring the strategems on how best to extract subservience and resources from the massses.
They get us all crazy about abortion, gay rights, prayer in schools, ACORN, Planned Parenthood, Britney Spears' couchie peeks, Beyonce's side-boobs while they steal, hoard, subvert and leech the lifeblood from the ideals this country was founded on-- a land by the people, for the people. They hit the hot buttons in all of us, liberals and tea baggers alike so we can waste our precious passions and energies in angry food fights about who's moralities are better than whom.
While they surely and clearly turn us all into sheeple...chewing on our artificially manufactured feed, inside our fenced world of corporate retail Disney worlds where they milk us and slaughter us to feed their insatiable greed for more.
This country is so sick, run by psychopaths who worship the holy god of wealth.  They run or academic centers, our government, our churches, our media.
And Obama, after promising straight-talk and a man-for-the-people assurances if he could just get our cash and votes, now turns out to be just another puppet.  Unable to change what is really diseased about our institutions. So it's only two possibilities: he's an impotent president, or one who is complicit in the game.
You know I seem to remember a recent village idiot president who got everything he wanted, when he wanted it regardless which party had what majority. If his decisions made some corporate entity shitwads of money, it got done.
And Obama? Those same entities making even bigger shitwads of cash than even Village idiot.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is attempting to educate Republicans, but it's not likely to work. As a reflection of just how brazenly political Republican opposition to anything President Obama wants to is, they've brought back the laughable assertion that Obama is attempting to ""pack"" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by filling three vacancies. Reid calls that what it is: ""ridiculous."" He's moving ahead with the nominations, and taking the nuclear option out of his back pocket and waving it around in front of Republicans, with some help from Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT).
The pressure to change Senate rules and strip Republicans of their power to filibuster certain judicial nominees ""would be almost insurmountable"" if Republicans block Millet's confirmation vote to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Leahy said at an event advocating Millett, currently a Supreme Court appellate attorney.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has already threatened to invoke the so-called nuclear option if Republicans don't let at least one of Obama's D.C. Circuit nominees get a vote. Millett, who will come up for a vote as soon as Thursday, is the first of Obama's three D.C. Circuit nominees to hit the Senate floor. Nina Pillard cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and is ready for a floor vote, while Robert Wilkins is set for his committee vote on Thursday.

By the way, one Republican senator let the cat out of the bag, and explained just why Republicans are trying to block any more Obama nominees to this critical court:
Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) said that he, too, will vote to filibuster Millett and revealed why Republicans want to keep Obama's nominee from getting on the court.
""We're worried about that court being a significant bastion for administrative law cases on Obamacare,"" Kirk said.

What a shock.

According to new national polling data from Pew Research, the American people have revolted against President Barack Obama’s and the GOP establishment’s efforts to grant amnesty to America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants through comprehensive immigration reform.
“Only about a third of the public (32%) approves of the job Obama is doing on immigration policy; 60% disapprove,” Pew wrote. “Obama’s ratings for this issue among Democrats are mixed: About half (53%) approve of his handling of the issue while 42% disapprove.”
Obama’s 60 percent disapproval rating on immigration from the American people is an all-time high for him on the issue and puts him on par with former President George W. Bush’s immigration polling numbers. Obama’s immigration disapproval rating has skyrocketed as he has ramped up his efforts to lobby Congress for the passage of an amnesty–particularly the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration bill.
As the American people have learned more and more about the Gang of Eight bill and the effects which amnesty and a drastic influx of millions of new workers would have on the hurting economy, they have grown more and more outraged with what Washington, D.C., is doing regarding immigration reform. In February–before Obama and lawmakers like Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and DIck Durbin (D-IL) began their push for immigration reform–the President’s immigration policy approval rating among the American people, according to Pew, was higher than his disapproval rating. His approval rating on immigration then was 44 percent, whereas his disapproval rating was 43 percent.
Over the next several months, the Obama administration worked with the Senate Democrats and a handful of Senate Republicans to develop the more-than-thousand-page-long Gang of Eight bill. The administration helped Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid rush the bill to the floor with hardly any substantive review from members, staffers, the media, and the American people.
In mid-June, before the Senate bill passed and as its ultimate passage became questionable, Obama’s Pew Research disapproval rating on immigration spiked up to 47 percent, and his approval rating on the issue dropped to 43 percent. With the public beginning to turn against amnesty, the Senators pushing for it cobbled together a series of amendments designed to win over extra votes in the Senate–like the Corker-Hoeven plan for their votes, casino kickbacks for Sen. Dean Heller’s vote, “Lobster Bait” for Susan Collins’ vote, and a seafood processing deal for Lisa Murkowski’s vote, among others–and rammed the bill through to final passage in the Senate.
Since then, Obama’s immigration disapproval rating, according to Pew, has skyrocketed to 60 percent. That disapproval rating is higher than George W. Bush’s ever was, according to a Pew chart on page 12 of the report, save one exception: in April 2006, Bush’s immigration disapproval rating reached 62 percent.
As Obama’s disapproval ratings reach all-time highs because of his support for amnesty, Republicans keep the issue alive. While House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) says the issue will not receive any votes in the House in 2013, which is probably true, the effort to grant amnesty from House GOP leadership is alive and well–and likely to continue in early 2014. 
Officials like Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus and House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) keep offering Obama cover by continuing to push for some kind of immigration package. In an interview this week with Bloomberg’s Al Hunt, Priebus continued pushing for amnesty.
“I think it can happen, and I think people like Paul Ryan and others still want something like that to happen,” Priebus said this week. “It could happen next year, I don’t think there’s any sort of midnight hour here.”
Ryan is in the process of drafting a bill that would grant America’s at least 11 million illegal immigrants legal status. “A lot of people are saying, just pass the Senate bill,” Ryan said this summer at a town hall event in Racine, Wisconsin. “That’s not what the House is going to do. I think we can make it better.”
Priebus and Ryan, if they keep pushing down this road, face the fate of what happened to Senator Rubio after he pushed for amnesty. Rubio has since backed off the push and publicly undercut the efforts of House GOP leadership to pass any group of piecemeal bills with the goal of getting to a conference committee negotiation with the Democratic Senate–from which a comprehensive immigration reform conference report like the Senate bill would arise. Rubio’s backtracking on the issue, and complete reversal of support for his own bill, came after the American people turned on him for supporting such a plan. Polling data over the past several months showed the once-promising presidential candidate tanking among Republican voters. 
House GOP leadership could technically kill this once and for all by promising publicly what Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX) has advocated: that there will never be a conference committee with the Senate bill. However, they have left the door open, as pressure from lobbyists and groups funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros ratchet up pressure on House Republicans to pass an amnesty.
If such legislation as the Gang of Eight bill were ever to become law, it would be considered President Obama’s signature second-term legislative achievement, much like Obamacare is his first term’s signature achievement. The difference from Obamacare is that Republicans like Priebus and Ryan are helping him achieve it, at least for now–largely because the donor community on Wall Street wants this policy.
Despite all the pressure from donors and special interests to do what Ryan and Priebus are doing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, offers a different pathway forward for the GOP: flip this whole debate on its head, undercut amnesty, and make the Democrats wear the blame for having fought against the interests of American workers. 
“In changing the terms of the immigration debate we will not only prevent the implementation of a disastrous policy, but begin a larger effort to broaden our appeal to working Americans of all backgrounds,” Sessions wrote in a memo to his GOP colleagues this summer. 
Now is the time to speak directly to the real and legitimate concerns of millions of hurting Americans whose wages have declined and whose job prospects have grown only bleaker. This humble and honest populism–in contrast to the Administration’s cheap demagoguery–would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. Of course, such a clear and honest message would require saying “no” to certain business demands and powerful interests who shaped the immigration bill in the Senate."

No, this is not snark or satire.  It's not an Onion article either..........

Whilst GOP aides are taking the lead and throwing Ted Cruz under the bus, at least one of their Senators is following their lead.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said he was ""proud"" of Boehner's handling of the crisis. Then within moments he pleaded with Democrats to bail out the GOP, which he admitted has ""screwed up"" and ""really did go too far"" in the shutdown and debt limit standoffs.

""We won't be the last political party to overplay our hand,"" he said. ""It might happen one day on the Democratic side. And if it did, would Republicans, for the good of the country, kinda give a little? We really did go too far. We screwed up. But their response is making things worse, not better.""



""would Republicans, for the good of the country, kinda give a little?""

You're kidding, right?



You're kidding, right?

The anniversary of the Gettysburg Address does not seem at first glance to be a subject steeped in controversy, but that is because you are not a dull-minded hack whose quest for new controversies must never fall below the speed of 50 miles per hour, lest the whole movement die.
Obama Snubs 150th Anniversary of Gettysburg Address
I'm going to spare you the actual article under that headline. I first saw the premise being propped up yesterday as a prospective ""scandal"" when it slithered past in a Twitter stream via the apparently-still-around Breitbart conspiracy site. I did not think much of it, because I am not a shit-for-brains, but apparently I misunderestimated just how obsessively Actual Conservative Pundits troll the conspiracy sites for fodder. Fox & Friends took it up this morning, and if that isn't ironclad proof that the story passes nicely under the you-must-be-this-stupid-to-enter bar than nothing is.
Fox News's Brian Kilmeade discussed with Wall Street Journal columnist Daniel Henninger whether it is ""inappropriate for our president to bypass"" the commemoration ceremony of the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address during the November 19 edition of Fox & Friends. At one point Kilmeade asked whether Henninger thought Obama was refusing to attend because ""after that address and after the Civil War we still weren't a perfect union? We still had to wait for the Civil Rights Act and so many -- the integration of schools, Brown vs. the Board of Education?"" Henninger replied, ""I think probably that President Obama does think the unfinished business remains unfinished in bringing the country and its races together.""
Christ, people. Just ... Christ.
More on the ""outrage"" below the fold.


In ""response"" to tweeted questions by the two outlets peddling the story, resident White House moron wrangler Dan Pfeiffer cheekily suggested that the White House had other priorities. He once again neglected to recognize that morons do not understand sarcasm:
In response to a journalist's Twitter query about what could be more important, Pfeiffer wrote: ""Oh, I don't know, there's this whole website thing that someone suggested might destroy the [Democratic] Party.""
... which naturally led to actual goddamn stories suggesting that Obama did not go to Gettysburg because of Obamacarez.
I suppose the main question here is which of these various shameless dunderhacks was the one who first came up with this as a plausible attack line—I am loathe to pin that on the Breitbart crowd when it could have been tossed over their transom by an even more eager shit-for-brains, or perhaps there is a collection of fabled shit-for-brains pundits that gets together each evening to determine who among them has the most foam-laden idea for an attack piece and they all clap their little hands together and run with it. That would mean all the others saw it floating around and said I believe I shall run with this, which makes them even more goddamn stupid and hackish than the original stupid hacks.
Now here is the key point, dear reader, and the reason why shit for brains ought not to be considered a crass insult at this point but merely a reasonable medical diagnosis. In all of American post-Lincoln history, only one sitting president has ever gone to Gettysburg on the anniversary of the address. Reagan did not go. The Bushii did not go. JFK did not go. Roosevelt never went, nor Nixon, nor President Biff the Unholy, Destroyer of Worlds. That honor apparently goes to Taft, and it has been a long damn time since anyone in the national press furrowed their brows and pondered what William Howard Taft would do in a given situation.
So no, we do not have to take any of this seriously. Nor do we have to take the purveyors of such obviously stupid faux-scandals seriously. Nor do we have to treat them with respect, or pretend for a bare minute that they have anything worthwhile to say about our political discourse that could not be better said by contemplating the contents of a litter box. The problem here is that there is no shame to be had in peddling conspiratorial trash in public. In better days people would cross to the other side of the street so that they would not have to listen to the nice man on the large box preaching about how President Obama is probably not attending the event only one other president in history (well, two, counting Lincoln himself) attended, and how that probably means the current president resents the tardiness of Brown v. Board of Education, and when a newspaper man walks up to that fellow with a notebook in hand, nodding and scribbling things down, that does not make it suddenly respectable. It only means there are two nuts standing on a street corner instead of one.
Cross to the other side, America. For the sake of pride and patriotism, will you just shun these damn people already?

Add to the growing list of Americans affected by the GOP-led government shutdown this adorable, heartbroken child:

Now, I present this image not to make light of the real suffering being caused by the current shutdown, from furloughed workers to cancer patients struggling to receive treatment.
I present this image because it is the perfect metaphor for the heartless, billionaire-funded hostage situation orchestrated by our country's Republican leadership.
For not only does this cute, costume-wearing kid imagistically represent those innocent Americans who are being hurt by the shutdown. This child also symbolizes a generation of voters who are growing up witnessing a national party embarrass itself – a national party self-destructive enough to be led by impetuous House representatives elected due only to gerrymandered districts.
In other words: this child won't be voting Republican. Nor will his peers who are also standing at the gates.

Beginning next month, Breitbart News Editor-At-Large Ben Shapiro will be leading the launch of a new project of the David Horowitz Freedom Center: TruthRevolt.org, an activism program designed to “unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public, and devastate their funding bases.” 
The program is being described as a conservative counterpunch to Media Matters, the Obama-linked organization that focuses on silencing conservatives in the media. “For too long, we’ve played by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, allowing the left to stifle the truth and silence truth tellers in the name of their politically correct narrative. Now we’re taking the battle to their home turf — and we will do so aggressively and unwaveringly, every single day. This is just another avenue for applying Breitbart’s fighting spirit to the battle against those who would destroy what America stands for,” Shapiro said. Shapiro will maintain his position and all of his duties at Breitbart News as well.
One of the founders of the New Left in the 1960s, David Horowitz has become an icon in the conservative movement, famed for his deep understanding of the ideology and strategy of the modern left in America. He has led the Freedom Center since its inception as the Center for the Study of Popular Culture in 1988. 
“We could not be more excited to be working with Ben on this project,” Horowitz told Breitbart News. “Andrew Breitbart was a fantastic friend to the Freedom Center and an indispensable warrior in the battle against the anti-America, socialist left and its allies in the universities, the unions and the Democratic Party, and Breitbart News carries on his legacy. We look forward to working with our friends at Breitbart in continuing the fight for America’s future.” 
Horowitz and Breitbart worked together on the film Occupy Unmasked, which looked behind the scenes at the institutional left’s control of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Horowitz’s life’s work in exposing the mendacity of the left was a key part of the film. “Occupy Unmasked shows how closely David and Andrew were on their work of exposing and defeating the forces of the institutional left in America. We consider Ben Shapiro’s leading role at ‘Truth Revolt’ to be nothing more than a continuation of that work,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News.
“Ben Shapiro is a charter member of the Breitbart News ‘Fight Club’ and has been instrumental in the explosive growth the site has experienced over the past 18 months,” said Bannon. “Ben’s ‘voice’ and fighting spirit will also be central in our building out both the site and the company in the years ahead.”
“As was so often the case, Andrew spotted and mentored important conservative voices long before they percolated up to a national level,” said Breitbart News President and CEO Larry Solov. “Ben, who when Andrew met him was a college student at UCLA, is one such voice. Ben has the fight and the intellectual heft to land devastating body blows to the institutional Left and the biased media, which is such a crucial part of what we do here at Breitbart News. We have encouraged Ben to take a leading role with David Horowitz in TruthRevolt to complement his ongoing work at Breitbart News where he will continue to help the grow the company and carry on the fighting spirit and legacy of Andrew Breitbart.”
Shapiro, a mentee and friend of Andrew Breitbart since age 17, became Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News in February 2012. Shapiro, 29, is the New York Times bestselling author of Bullies: How the Left’s Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America (2013), as well as Primetime Propaganda: The True Hollywood Story of How the Left Took Over Your TV (2011), Project President: Bad Hair and Botox on the Road to the White House (2008), Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future (2005), and Brainwashed: How Universities Indoctrinate America’s Youth (2004). Shapiro began his career as the youngest syndicated columnist in the nation with Creators Syndicate, graduated Harvard Law School at 23, and hosts The Morning Answer on KRLA 870 in Los Angeles. 
Shapiro has been widely praised across the conservative movement. Sarah Palin says that Americans should “consider Ben’s advice about how we must stand up and push back twice as hard against this bullying.” Sean Hannity says to join Ben Shapiro and “fight back!” against liberal bullying. Glenn Beck calls Shapiro a “warrior for conservatism, against those who use fear and intimidation to stifle honest debate. I’ve never known him to back down from a fight.” And Michelle Malkin says Shapiro is “infused with the indomitable spirit of his friend and mentor Andrew Breitbart.” Even the liberal Washington Post, in the aftermath of Shapiro’s devastating destruction of Piers Morgan on national television, conceded that Shapiro is a “foe of extraordinary polemical agility.”"

Abuse of power. What else can we call the actions Republicans have taken in their drive to sabotage Obamacare? And let's be clear, sabotaging Obamacare means keeping as many people as possible uninsured. The Republicans intend—to paraphrase a quotation from the Vietnam War—to destroy this village in order to save it. The White House has options, however, if it is willing to contemplate them. But that means taking the advice Chicago beat cop Jimmy Malone gave to federal Treasury officer Eliot Ness in The Untouchables (see above), as it applies (non-violently of course) to the political arena. In other words, it's time to go nuclear.
Let's step back for a minute and examine just what Republicans have been doing. We can start with the lies. The claims that Obamacare will drive up premiums were recently debunked by a new Kaiser study, which found they are coming in even lower than expected. We do have to remember of course that reality has a well known liberal bias. In any case, the Grand Ole' Party doesn't stop at lying. That's kid stuff.
Republicans have obstructed Obamacare at the state level wherever they've been able to. In one of the most egregious examples, we have Georgia State Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens, who bragged about his own efforts:
""Let me tell you what we're doing [about Obamacare.] Everything in our power to be an obstructionist.""
""We have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance. The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we'll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we're going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write 'navigator test' on it.""

And it's not just Georgia. Follow me beyond the fold for more abuses as well as my proposal for how the White House can checkmate at least the ones emanating from Congress.



A whole gaggle of Republican-controlled states are coming up with all kinds of ways to sabotage Obamacare's rollout. There is no doubt whatsoever about what Republicans, personified by Ralph Hudgens, are doing here. They are using and abusing the powers they possess in order to sabotage this law.
We can compare their behavior to that of Democrats after the passage of Medicare Part D—championed by George W. Bush. Democrats, although most of them opposed the law, engaged in no such attempts to sabotage its rollout. They fought on the floor of the House and Senate, but once they lost, they accepted that the law is the law in a democracy. But that's not how Republicans operate.
Perhaps the most egregious and potentially effective measure in the effort to obstruct Obamacare comes out of the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week submitted a request for a huge amount of irrelevant information from navigators—the people whose job it is to guide and educate citizens about how Obamacare can work for them. The fact that Republicans at the state and federal level have focused on throwing up roadblocks in the way of the navigators shows just how important they will be to the success of Obamacare.
The request from the Energy and Commerce Committee came in less than a month before the new Obamacare health insurance exchanges go live on Oct. 1, and serves no purpose other than to drain time, energy and resources away from navigators in the run-up to that date. Of course, the Committee has largely targeted states where the highest percentage of the population lacks insurance. In case you were wondering, yes, Texas is the worst offender. Go conservatism!
Law professor and health reform advocate Timothy Jost had this to say about the House's efforts:
Look at item 6 and the accompanying sheet defining documents subject to the request. This could include hundreds of documents and emails and could take days to locate and compile. It might have been reasonable to ask them to describe what they do and how they intend to do it. This is a much more intrusive and extensive request. It is also important to note that most of these organizations are doing this on a comparative shoestring, and this is the busiest time in their existence. They just got their grants, they are concluding cooperative agreements with HHS, they are hiring, training their employees, getting them certified, setting up security systems, making contacts, and even to have to take a day off to respond to this is too much. And the committee knows this. This is not about gathering information. It is about trying to stop a program. (Emphasis mine)
The time has come to put a stop to these kinds of actions. The Republicans have taken a power that is designed to be applied reasonably and judiciously, namely Congress' authority to oversee the executive branch, and abused it beyond recognition. They have twisted that authority into an instrument to defy democracy, to render null the laws passed by the people's elected representatives.
This abuse cannot be allowed to stand. It is a perversion of democracy. The time has come to fight back. What can we do about it? If I were the president, I'd want to do whatever was in my power to fight back. And here's my idea:
Yes, Congress has the power to issue these demands for information. There is no limit on their oversight power, other than that they cannot violate a citizen's civil liberties. In fact, if the navigators do not comply, they can be held in contempt of Congress, a federal charge. Fine. But the President can checkmate this move with one of his own.
The Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, describes the President's power to pardon, according to which he or she:
shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.
There is no other limit on that power. The president can issue a pardon as soon as a crime has been committed, there is no need to wait for any charges to be brought.
President Obama should announce that:
1) The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee to the Obamacare navigators is nothing more than a blatant attempt to prevent Americans from obtaining health insurance.
2) The request is part of a broader Republican scheme to sabotage Obamacare -- which is the law of the land.
3) The request is an abuse of power, plain and simple. Our government cannot function properly if one side is allowed to abuse its power in order to prevent duly enacted laws from functioning properly.

The president should declare that, for these reasons, he authorizes all the targeted parties to ignore the request from the House of Representatives. Furthermore, he will issue immediate, full, and complete pardons to anyone that the House attempts to prosecute for ignoring their request, or any other similar requests that the President deems equally abusive and designed to sabotage duly passed laws.
This would be a serious step, and it is not one I advocate lightly. Of course, Barack Obama wouldn't the first president to try and get around a congressional subpoena. We are talking about something different here, however, than what George W. Bush did. Congressional oversight is about checks and balances, making sure that no branch of government gains too much power. The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee is part of an attempt by one party to undo legislation even though it lacks the votes to do so. If they succeed, there will be no point to even having elections. What I have proposed is a defensive measure, one that fights fire with fire rather than something designed to cover up misdeeds.
When one side keeps punching below the belt, the other side eventually has no choice but to do whatever it can to defend itself. In this case, the White House would be defending its signature law, which really means defending the people who wouldn't be able to get health insurance without it. Furthermore, the president would be defending democracy against an opponent that has shown time and again that it does not care how it obtains power.
The Marquess of Queensbury and his rules ain't welcome at this contest. It's a street fight. It's time for the White House to get ugly. Long past time.
The question for President Obama is the same one the Chicago beat cop put to the G-Man in The Untouchables:
What are you prepared to do?

550,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/02/18/Sarah-Palin-to-Address-CPAC-in-March,Opinion,Breitbart,Democrat,Sarah Palin to Address CPAC in March,"

The American Conservative Union (ACU), which runs the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), announced on Monday that Sarah Palin will speak at the 40th annual gathering of conservatives in March.
“We are pleased to again welcome Governor Sarah Palin to CPAC in March,” ACU Chairman Al Cardenas said in a statement. “Governor Palin electrified the crowd in 2012 and we are thrilled to welcome her back this year.”
CPAC 2013 will be held Thursday, March 14 through Saturday, March 16, 2013 at its new location in National Harbor, MD at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center. 
The non-Washington, D.C. location of this year’s conference is fitting for Palin, who blistered the permanent political class and crony capitalism during her 2012 address last year in the nation’s capital in her first appearance at the conference.
Last year, she was mobbed in the hallways before her speech. Palin stayed for nearly an hour after speaking, engaging conservatives and supporters who were there to listen to her. Reporters and observers at CPAC noted in 2012 they had not seen anyone who resonated with the conservative base more than Palin. 
At CPAC 2012, Palin said Washington, D.C. had become “something that our forefathers never envisioned, and they would have sworn their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to change.”
Palin said the “old Washington of our Founders” was a place where people “came to serve your government, not prosper over it and on it and from it and off of it.” She mentioned the country’s wealthiest counties were all around the D.C. region, a theme director Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Schweizer’s Government Accountability Institute would later document a year later in “Boomtown.” 
She referenced her speech in Indianola, Iowa in 2011 when she spoke of “crony capitalism” that “isn’t the capitalism of free men and free markets, of risk and sacrifice, of innovation and hard work.” She said the new crony capitalism is one of “connections” and of “government bailout and handouts” and waste, “corporate welfare and corruption.” 
After her Indianola speech, “crony capitalism” and “permanent political class” were injected into the political vocabulary. 
“This is the capitalism of Barack Obama and the permanent political class,” Palin said at CPAC in 2012. 
She lambasted the Occupy protesters who were at the conference in 2012, saying they should be instead protesting at Obama’s White House, which has “spurred the expansion of government which diminishes freedom and opportunity for all to rise and to succeed.”
Palin derided politicians who come to Washington, D.C. “denouncing the place as the cesspool of corruption” only to, after a year or two, see it as a hot tub. 
“And they are hopping in and enjoying the jacuzzi,” Palin said, noting it was “time we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.”
After Palin turned down Fox News’ offer to renew her contract, she spoke exclusively to Breitbart News about her future. When asked what her response was to the mainstream media’s declarations that she and the Tea Party were “buried,” Palin said she was raised “to never retreat and to pick battles wisely, and all in due season.”
“When it comes to defending our republic, we haven’t begun to fight! But we delight in those who underestimate us,” Palin told Breitbart News last month.

551,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/12/25/Christmas-Obama-pay-raise,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,Santa Obama Gives Pay Raise to Federal Workers,"
Just in time for Christmas, President Obama signed an executive order on Monday giving a 1 percent pay raise for federal employees. The raise follows a four year hiatus from salary increases for federal workers, although most federal employees have apparently seen their pay increase via promotion or performance. The first increased paycheck will kick in on January 1.
President Obama’s reward to the federal workforce follows his longstanding belief that government work ought to be a first option for Americans. Nonetheless, Obama’s decision to raise federal pay only widens the income inequality gap between federal workers and private sector employees; as of 2011, the average private sector employee made $59,804 in salary, and $28,000 in benefits, while the average federal workers made $74,436 in salary and $40,000 in benefits.
Furthermore, the gap between Washington, D.C. culture and the rest of the country is growing ever larger. Between 2000 and 2012, according to Census Bureau statistics, Washington, D.C. household income jumped 23.3%; the rest of the country, by contrast, dropped 6.6%. As the Wall Street Journal reported, “The Washington, D.C. metro area — which includes the surrounding suburbs in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia — has it even better, with a median household income of $88,233 that ranks highest among the U.S.’s 25 most populous metro areas.”
But Washington, D.C. remains completely dichotomous, with the percentage of residents living 50% below the poverty line increasing 1% during that period.
President Obama’s Christmas present to his federal friends will amount to nothing more than another lump of coal in the rest of America’s stocking.

552,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/01/12/ethics-emails-epa,Opinion,Breitbart,Republican,EPA Email Scandal Fits Pattern of Its Secrecy,"
As a candidate for president, Barack Obama promised to lead the most open, most transparent administration in history. He has not kept that promise. Time and again, members of his administration have failed to keep faith with the American people. Acting in secret, they have taken sometimes extraordinary steps to shield their actions from the public.
The latest example involved Lisa Jackson, who has led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since the beginning of the president’s first term. Jackson is resigning, but only after it was revealed she used a fake name (Richard Windsor) to create a fake e-mail address to conduct official EPA business.
What Jackson did contravenes federal law which, because as a nation we value open and transparent government, prohibits such behavior.
This is not the first time the EPA has been in the spotlight because its administrator acted against the interests of transparency. Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton and then served for a time as President Obama’s “environmental czar” – ordered the hard drive on her government computer erased and reformatted and all backup tapes destroyed only hours after a federal judge had ordered the EPA to preserve all agency e-mail records.
This conduct, the use of phony e-mail addresses and the erasure of computers pose an interesting question: What is the EPA and its administrators doing that they are so unwilling to have their official communications become public? It doesn’t paint a pretty picture for the left’s agenda or its methods of implementation.
Jackson’s conduct came to light only after a a whistle-blower divulged she was using her fake e-mail account to conduct controversial business, evade congressional oversight, and get around the requirements of the federal Freedom of Information Act. Typically, government business is conducted in public. Correspondence and e-mail must be available to scrutiny, both by Congress and the American people. When a fake name is used, it allows an agency and its employees to evade accountability.
There is no way around it. This is government corruption at its highest form – and the polar opposite of the kind of transparent and open government political leaders on both sides of the aisle claim to want.
EPA’s record of following the law and being transparent couldn’t be much worse. Obama’s EPA has twice failed to provide as required by law a “Unified Agenda” which is a compendium of regulations planned in the foreseeable future. For the record, no other administration has ever even once failed to meet the requirements of this law. This, combined with the more than 12,000 secret e-mails, suggests a pattern of chicanery, obfuscation, and lawlessness at Obama’s EPA.
The problem does not end with Ms. Jackson or her staff. For the last four years, when asked to respond to lawful requests for information by Congress or by American citizens under FOIA, EPA attorneys did not provide e-mail sent and received by the administrator at her “Richard Windsor” e-mail address. Moreover, they affirmed that all responsive e-mails had been provided, when they clearly had not.
It is important whether these attorneys knew or had reason to know that their representations were false. And it is incumbent on the U.S. Congress and, perhaps, the U.S. Department of Justice to begin an inquiry into whether they did so.
To stop the culture of corruption at the EPA, it is not sufficient for Ms. Jackson to step down. There must be a comprehensive investigation concerning the actions of Ms. Jackson, her staff, and EPA attorneys who were involved. It must be determined who knew about or participated in the corruption. Ms. Jackson clearly did but did anyone else? Any government employee involved should be fired and prosecuted. If they are an attorney, they should also be disbarred.
No one has ever gone to jail for violating the Freedom of Information Act but, the federal mail and wire fraud law is broadly used to target corruption in government that falls well short of bribery or extortion. Ms. Jackson and all those who participated in the fraudulent and fake e-mail scheme should face prosecution.
Once the 12,000 or more secret e-mails become public, Attorneys General and United States Attorneys all over the United States will likely have jurisdiction to investigate and perhaps even prosecute Ms. Jackson or anyone else who were involved in there e-mail fraud scheme. Congress should also have a full investigation and also determine if other of agencies have engaged in similarly corrupt schemes designed to shield their activities from public scrutiny, particularly those that pertain to the official function of their position and the development of public policy.
The Obama administration has been one of the least transparent or open administrations in memory. The activities of Lisa Jackson at the EPA are just one example of that. If the president hopes to remove the taint from his administration, he must take a personal interest in rooting out this sort of corruption. He cannot simply accept Ms. Jackson’s resignation and call the matter closed.

Up until just a few days ago, the American media were our country’s top cheerleaders for what they describe as “functional government.” The highest value in government, according to our media, was “getting things done.” And the way to get things done, we were told repeatedly, was through civility, compromise, and bipartisanship. But over the past couple of days, as the prospect of a government shutdown looms closer, the media have completely abandoned those principles.
In the name of civility, I’m old enough to remember (because it was just last week) when the media made politicians pay a heavy political price for harsh rhetoric and name-calling. Again and again, we have seen the media turn away from the issue at hand and make the “rhetoric” used to push the issue the issue. 
For example, when running for president last year, Newt Gingrich wanted to talk about the explosion of food stamp recipients under President Obama. But the media just wanted to talk about whether he was racist for using the words “food stamps.” 
Think about how many times some local Republican politician, or some conservative private citizen, at a town hall meeting, has made national headlines because of what the media described as “extremist political rhetoric.” Good heavens, how many times has some straggler’s Tea Party sign made NBC’s Chuck Todd tut-tut with disgust. 
Think about how many times the media have used how a conservative made a political point as a way to gang up on and relentlessly pummel him or her — all while ignoring the issue. 
Remember that whole fashion season of the media collectively wringing its hands over “eliminationist rhetoric?” Remember how the following fashion season was devoted to the scourge of “bullying.”
But that was then; this is now — and now the media have officially ended their opposition to over-the-top political rhetoric. We don’t know this because the media sent out a memo or made an official announcement; we know this because President Obama and Democrats have been accusing Republicans of being arsonists, anarchists, terrorists, extremists — and this is all Chuck Todd has to say about it…
—
“Hobby horse” “shenanigans” “extremists” and “burn the house down”.  How POTUS described Congress today. GOP getting a taste of bully pulpit
— Chuck Todd (@chucktodd) September 27, 2013
—
And the rest of the media have been just as shoulder-shrugging and silent in the face of all this harsh, partisan, eliminationist rhetoric. 
But that is not the only change in media policy that happened this past week. The media are also no longer concerned with making Washington work or the value of bipartisanship and working across the aisle. President Obama, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi have made it absolutely clear that they will not negotiate in budget battles that could result in a government shutdown, and the media are absolutely okay with this.  
In the past, when Republicans dug in their heels or didn’t seem willing to compromise enough to satisfy Obama, the media were outraged over DC dysfunction and the lack of bipartisan compromise.
So it is finally over — the era of the media placing the highest value on bipartisan compromise and civility has finally ended. The media are now for harsh rhetoric, gridlock, and extremism. Or…
…maybe the media are just a bunch of hypocritical, lying, left-wing hacks who despise the GOP and are willing to sell their honor in order to help Obama to a political win?
Either way.

Paul Begala at The Daily Beast:
Barack Obama is a remarkably gifted politician. But his cardinal political error has been that at times he seems to lack the imagination to even conceptualize how truly nihilistic, irresponsible, partisan, and, yes, crazy his Republican opponents are. The last Democratic president saw the Republicans shut down the government, squander millions on partisan witch hunts—including taking 140 hours of sworn testimony investigating President Clinton’s Christmas-card list—and drag the country through an impeachment process. Despite that history—and despite that Obama may be dealing with Republicans who are even more ideological and self-destructive than in Clinton’s day—he still expressed a blind faith in their reasonableness. How quaint.
This faith in the reasonableness of others is quintessentially American. We are, after all, a nation born of the Enlightenment. John Locke, the intellectual godfather of the American Revolution, said, “Reason must be our last judge and guide in everything.” But John Locke was a 17th-century English philosopher, not a 21st-century Tea Party nihilist. Obama, sadly, is not dealing with Mr. Locke—nor with Mr. Spock—but rather with zealous partisans who would, it seems, gladly harm the country in order to hurt the president. Highly illogical, perhaps, but real.
Our president, however, is nothing if not smart. And so he has adapted. Instead of sitting with Boehner and Cantor and McConnell, seeking to appeal to the cool light of reason, which failed so miserably in previous budget showdowns, he is barnstorming the country, basking in the warm glow of popular approval. Whereas once he seemed to prefer the prophet Isaiah’s entreaty, “Come now, let us reason together,” now he seems to be channeling the prophet Ezekiel: “I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes.” Fortunately for our nation, the president seems to have hit upon a strategy that works.
Let's go below the fold for more analysis on the latest top news stories.



Rick Perlstein's must-read at The Nation:
So: the “sequester.” That too-clever-by-half notion, born of last year’s debt ceiling negotiations out of the White House’s presumption that, when faced with the horror of heedless, profligate, across-the-board budget cuts to all manner of popular government programs, the Republicans’ “fever would break”—remember that?—and the Loyal Opposition would somehow come to agree to a reasonable, “balanced” deficit reduction package. It all seemed so cut and dried in those palmy days, just a few months ago: who could possibly imagine a major American political party could possibly let such madness actually go into effect?
Um, me? I wonder how many folks within the White House, gaming out whether Republicans might not just call the bluff, bothered to consider the fact that an embrace of heedless, profligate, across-the-board budget cuts to all manner of popular government programs is a key component of hardcore conservative ideology. [...] Did anyone in the White House notice how many conservatives, including ones in positions of governmental power, after Mitt Romney’s recorded back-room admission that he couldn’t get elected because 47 percent of the electorate is addicted to suckling on the federal teat, responded that what he said was absolutely correct? [...] And what could the White House have predicted conservatives would say to those who point out that pulling the rug out from under huge chunks of federal spending will spur a recession? They could have predicted that many would say exactly what they have said: that since it’s excessive federal spending that causes recessions, what’s wrong with cutting excessive federal spending?
Bottom line: didn’t anyone whose job it is to think about such things consider that at least some powerful Republicans—not all, it is true—would relish sequestration as a marvelous thing, a historic opportunity, a gift from Obama to help further the cause they’d been proclaiming as sacred for generations: to shrink the federal government small enough so they could someday drown it in Grover Norquist’s proverbial bathtub? “Once these cuts take effect, thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off and tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids,” said Obama. Did he ever consider that to a lot of Republicans, that would sound like a wish list?

Haley Sweetland Edwards at The Washington Monthly looks at how rule-making can affect the president's major policies:
It may seem counterintuitive, but those big hunks of legislation, despite being technically the law of the land, filed away in the federal code, don’t mean anything yet. They are, in the words of one CFTC official, “nothing but words on paper” until they’re broken down into effective rules, implemented, and enforced by an agency. Rules are where the rubber of our legislation hits the road of real life. To put that another way, if a rule emerges from a regulatory agency weak or riddled with loopholes, or if it’s killed entirely—like the CFTC’s rule on position limits—it is, in effect, almost as if that part of the law had not passed to begin with.
As of now, there’s no guarantee that either Obamacare or Dodd-Frank will be made into rules that actually do what lawmakers intended. That’s partly because the rule-making process is a dangerous place for a law to go.

Patrick Murphy look at how DOMA affects military families:
Last December, U.S. Marine Corps. Captain Matthew Phelps got down on one knee and proposed to the person he loved most in the world. It was one of the happiest moments of his life. The fact that it occurred in the White House made it all that much sweeter. Pictures of the moment went viral, popping up all over Twitter and Facebook.
Amazingly, while most Americans can recognize how special that moment was, our government continues to deny its significance. That’s because Matthew is gay, and due to that fact alone, his soon-to-be husband, Ben Schock, will be denied hundreds of benefits that we routinely give to military families.

Jay Bookman looks at corporate profits and points out that...:
...conservatives continue to argue that the business climate under President Obama stifles profitability.
He then links to this chart:

In the chart, the share of the national economy, or GDP, going to workers’ paychecks is in blue. The share of the economy that is going to after-tax corporate profits is in red.
It's a chart that makes the conservative claim that big business needs more corporate welfare all that more illogical.

Cross posted from Blue Virginia
From the latest (3/24/13) Northern Virginia Tea Party Newsletter, these people are seriously - as in, this apparently isn't parody - opposing the proposed ""Soviet"" Arlington County streetcar project because of...wait for it...Agenda 21. What is this evil known as Agenda 21, you ask? How about ""a non-binding, voluntarily implemented action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development?"" Crazy, I know. And speaking of tinfoil-hat crazy, Glenn Beck opposes it because...""This used to be called America. Now it is just 'the Republic.' There is no president. No congress. No freedom. There is only Agenda 21."" And it all starts with a seemingly innocuous streetcar line in Arlington County, Virginia. Shuddderrrrr... (snark)


P.S. Needless to say, I strongly urge non-Tea-Party Arlingtonians to come out in large numbers Wednesday evening to express your support for the streetcar, and to say NO to John Bircher/tinfoil hat nuttiness.

UPDATE: And now for some sanity from Arlington County Board member Jay Fisette:
Streetcar Town Hall - to be held on Wednesday, March 28, 6:30-9 pm at the Kenmore Middle School auditorium and dedicated to a discussion of the Columbia Pike Streetcar. The Town Hall is open to the public and will update the community on our planned streetcar system, discuss next steps and answer questions.  After many years of planning and a multitude of community meetings, both the Fairfax and Arlington County Boards accepted our professional staff recommendations and chose the modern streetcar as the transit system for Columbia Pike in 2006. The streetcar will run about 5 miles from Skyline in Fairfax to Pentagon City, where it will connect to another streetcar line that will run through Crystal City to Potomac Yard.  Both boards reaffirmed that choice in 2012 while applying for federal funding to help fund the streetcar.  
The projected $250M to construct the Columbia Pike streetcar would be covered by federal (30%), state (14%), Fairfax (14%) and Arlington (42%). The Arlington funds would come from a dedicated Transportation Capital Fund generated from a state-authorized surcharge on commercial real estate.  Despite widespread misunderstanding, these funds cannot be used for education, housing, public safety or anything except transportation.  
I have supported the streetcar since 2006, though I know that some have questions or concerns.  I encourage folks to attend this Town Hall. To learn more about the Columbia Pike Streetcar plan, visit here and here.

Looking like a winner!



Looking like a winner!

President Obama, sick and tired of constantly being that 'adult in the room' and constantly giving things up to bullies and getting little to nothing in return, has turned a corner in his presidency. He's done with winning niceness points with schoolmarms and Miss Manners types. Now he's ready to kick some goddamn ass and by god he's doing it. Fuck being an adult in a room. Its time to be a politician in Washington.
Rightly, both morally and politically, President Obama has fixed himself in position and isn't moving or bending. He offers nothing. He commends nobody for doing their ordinary jobs. Republicans are surprised by his sudden burst of strength. So much so, they are backtracking, divided, and negotiating with themselves. Big business is scared. The GOP establishment is confused. Ted Cruz and the nutcase fringe that started all this have no idea how this ends. The one thing Republicans know is that they want out of this mess, in a way that isn't completely humiliating.
Let me be clear (as the President would say): The result will be humiliating. Republicans shutdown the government to stop ObamaCare. ObamaCare isn't stopped. They failed and that will be apparent just as soon as this ends. President Obama can bank this victory plus a few others: a divided, beaten GOP; a rump Speaker headed towards oblivion; and a perfect foil for the next six months, newly minted GOP leader Ted Cruz.
So, to finish this in a flourish, here is all President Obama needs to do next:
1. Throw the GOP a life jacket riddled with Smallpox.
No budget negotiations at all, but a minor concession would be appropriate. Something that includes a bit of a poison pill. My idea would be small corporate tax cut. They don't pay any taxes now anyway, so cutting them wouldn't cost us anything. But more importantly, it allows us to say that the GOP brought us to the brink of the default and shut down the government all on behalf of Big Corporations and Wall Street. That should be enough to allow a stupid face saving, piss off the Tea Party nutcases into turning on their own leadership, and get Big Business to keep some of their cash on the sidelines for a while.
2. Frame the reopening of the government and approval of the debt increase for the 2014 elections.
The last thing President Obama should do is give the kind of ridiculous speech he gave at the end of the 2011 mess. He was absolutely right to clear the decks among his senior staff after that fiasco. Instead, he should make it clear that this kind of governing can only be resolved by the American people next year. That only they can put a stop to this foolishness by throwing Republicans out. Repeat what he said the other day in Maryland: this is going to keep happening until the American people get rid of Republicans. He should offer absolutely no praise for Boehner or any of the Republicans who help re-open government. Instead, they should be told in no uncertain terms that the 2014 election begins NOW and their behavior is whats on the ballot.
Finally, I want to commend Washington Democrats and the White House for finally acting like a majority party that has the right to rule. When the Republican Party is down, you don't offer them the hand of the Good Samaratan. Instead, you see them lying in the gutter, you go ahead and kick them in the teeth and stomp repeatedly on their sternum. Then throw them a wet towelette and tell em 'Now clean yourself up.'

The Louisville Courier-Journal has a long and storied history. Originally the product of a merger between several Louisville newspapers in 1868, the newspaper has been the largest print outlet in the city for well over a century. But of late, the newspaper has undergone severe economic problems, with owner Gannett Company laying off 51 employees in 2008 and 44 more in 2009.
Part of that is the newspaper’s dramatic shift to the left over the past few years. Since the election in November, the newspaper’s editorial board has called for Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to resign as Senate Minority Leader and accused McConnell of being the target of “national ridicule,” and run comics depicting McConnell consigned to the flames of hell; it has suggested that Senate Republicans “smacked down the disabled of this country and the world.”
In the latest symptom of that circulation-killing shift left, the newspaper is laying off longtime columnist John David Dyche, a Harvard Law grad and area lawyer who has been writing the token conservative column on the paper since 2003.
Why are they laying Dyche off? Dyche proposed a column to the newspaper suggesting fixes for their editorial woes, including:
The editorial board did not take such suggestions kindly, and rejected the column outright. They told Dyche that the column was not within the purview of his mandate as a conservative columnists. Editorial Director Pam Platt left Dyche a message:
Hi, John David, it’s Pam Platt at the Courier-Journal and I’m just calling to let you know that I’m not going to run your column tomorrow.  To me it goes sort of off of what your column is supposed to be.  My understanding is a conservative take on issues of the day and that’s not what this is.  So, anyway, thanks a lot and I’ll talk to you soon.
Dyche responded by email:
[T]he submitted column is very much about “a conservative take on the issues of the day.”  One of those issues is liberal media bias.  Another such issue is the survival of old line newspapers in a changing media marketplace.  Conservatives think there is liberal media bias and that old line newspapers would fare better in the marketplace if they made changes of the sort I propose.  Indeed, your refusal to run this column vividly illustrates the very issues about which I write!
Dyche added, “If there is no change of mind on the paper’s part we should probably end my decade-old relationship with the paper.” Platt quickly wrote back, “I do want to thank you for the pieces you did on the opinion pages for the past 10 years, and I wish you the very best in your life and your work.”
That’s how the left handles calls for balance. By destroying the only semblance of balance they have left.

During his radio show on Friday, Rush Limbaugh told his listeners, “I think abortion is at the root of so much that has and is going wrong in this country.” 
The conservative host went on to discuss that the reason why amnesty is essential to the liberal agenda is because abortion has, since Roe v. Wade in 1973, wiped out millions of potential taxpayers. The Democrat Party, Limbaugh said, has turned to amnesty as a means to ensure a “permanent underclass” in order to continue its image as the party of big government entitlements. 
Limbaugh said: 
Folks, let me tell you the way Washington thinks, in many ways, but this is one way they think.  They need money.  The US government needs money.  We are hopelessly in debt.  The tax increases that are coming are already over the top.  Washington knows, much of official Washington knows that they’ve gone beyond the point here, taxation, because the impact on economic growth and productivity and creativity has now been stifled.  I mean, the tax rates are such that real creation of wealth, real opportunity for prosperity is diminishing left and right.  
They’ve got to come up with money.  And they know this:  If you use the popularly accepted figure of 1.3 million abortions a year, go back to Roe vs. Wade 1973, 52 million taxpayers haven’t been born, is the way Washington looks at it.  They don’t look at it morally. They don’t look at it in any kind of cultural way or any kind of cultural impact. They just say we’re 52 million people short.  We have 52 million fewer people paying taxes.  We gotta replace ’em.  Hello amnesty.  The Democrat Party needs a permanent underclass in order to keep themselves alive as Santa Claus, to keep winning elections and stay in power. 
“I think that the number of abortions themselves…culturally, in terms of the sanctity of life, how that’s crumbled, I think it’s almost at the root of everything,” Limbaugh went on to say. “And if it’s not at the root of everything, it’s clearly had a profound impact on our culture, our society, and our politics, I think in ways that people don’t even stop to consider.” 
Limbaugh discussed the fact that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to answer the Weekly Standard‘s question on Thursday about the morality of late-term abortion. 
“And, by the way, that’s it, she wasn’t gonna talk any more about it because she is a devout Catholic,” Limbaugh said. “She has six kids, and it isn’t about politics, and she’s not gonna discuss it anymore, she said, because the interviewer was taking it in the direction of politics, and abortion isn’t politics. Abortion is sacred ground, she said. It is the sacrament of liberalism, is what it is.”"

After promising she would attend the “Million Vet March,” former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin went to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. on Sunday–along with Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Ted Cruz (R-TX)–to support thousands of veterans demanding that President Barack Obama re-open the memorials that have been barricaded due to the government shutdown.
At the World War II Memorial, Palin said that Obama is showing a “shameful lack of respect” and a “lack of valor” by barricading the memorials to veterans from across the country that marched in Washington to demand that Congress pass a law making it illegal for the federal government to close the memorials in future government shutdowns. They reportedly chanted, “tear down these walls.”
“We were proud to stand with thousands of America’s vets and other patriotic Americans today in Washington, D.C. This morning, Todd and I met with Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee, and they joined us and other Americans at the World War II Memorial and then at the Lincoln Memorial, where we were met by a SWAT team in full riot gear!” Palin wrote in a Facebook post. “Watching those who have fought to protect freedom prevented by barricades from visiting these memorials to freedom was truly heart wrenching.”
Palin has said Messrs. Lee and Cruz are leading a party of “good guys” in the Senate against both party establishments that make up Washington’s permanent political class. After the Republican establishment attacked Lee and Cruz during the defunding Obamacare fight, Palin fiercely defended them for representing everyday Americans. Palin has also called for Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience regarding the “Barrycades” at the memorials. At the march, veterans removed barricades from the memorial and took them to the White House.
Though the Obama administration officials put up barricades at the open-air memorials, they allowed thousands of amnesty supporters to rally on the National Mall, which was also supposed to be closed due to the government shutdown, last week in support of comprehensive immigration reform. On Saturday, Palin called out the Obama administration for revealing what their true priorities are during what she called a government “slim-down.”

Lee urged the crowd to “stand strong for liberty” and emphasized the memorial “belongs to the people.”
Cruz echoed Lee’s remarks. 
After emphasizing that “our veterans should be above politics,” Cruz said he met with World War II veterans on “Honor Flights” last week and said they told him, “We stormed the beaches of Normandy, do they really think these little barricades [will keep us from seeing the World War II memorial]?”
Palin emphasized that Americans will now “take up the fight for freedom” and “won’t let you down”: 
We’re here to show that the size of America’s heart for our veterans is immeasurable! But look around – barricades to shut down our memorials? Is this how a Commander in Chief expresses his gratitude? This “shutdown” priority proves a shameful lack of respect. It reflects a person’s lack of valor.
But, Vets, We the People have learned from you! We know America will only remain the “Home of the Free” so long as we are the “Home of the Brave!”
So, as we honor you, U.S. Military, know that our gratitude will not sleep! We will be brave! You were not timid, so we shall not be timid in calling out ANY who heart-wrenchingly would use you as pawns in a political game.
America’s finest paid the price for our freedom today. Vets, you protected us from tyranny then. Rest now, it is OUR turn to protect against tyranny again.
Ronald Reagan said, “Some people live an entire lifetime wondering if they ever made a difference in the world.” YOU, vets, need never ask that of yourselves. You made ALL the difference!
Our war memorials remind us of the cost to keep us free. YOU paid the price! Rest now! We will pick up the mantle. We won’t let you down. We now take up the fight for freedom!

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin announced that she will travel to Washington, D.C. on Sunday to support and honor the veterans who will be arriving for the “Million Vet March” on the memorials.
Speaking at a rally for New Jersey Republican Senate candidate Steve Lonegan along with Mark Levin on Saturday, Palin denounced the Obama administration for dishonoring veterans by barricading the World War II Memorial during the federal government shutdown. She said it was “heart-wrenching,” “atrocious,” and “not right.”  
“We’re going to zip on in to D.C.,” Palin said of herself and her husband Todd. “We’re going to shake hands with those vets who are being dishonored.”
Palin then accused the Obama administration of “using our military as pawns” during the government shutdown with such actions. 
She also mentioned that the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), whose seat Lonegan and Democrat Cory Booker are running for, was the last World War II veteran to serve in Congress and noted that his memory was also being dishonored by the Obama administration’s actions. 
Palin said the memorials serve to remind Americans of “the cost to provide for this exceptional nation” and the price Americans have had to pay to fight “against tyranny” and “for liberty.” 
Palin noted that the memorials, though they received some federal assistance, were also built with private donations. 
“And our government thinks they can shut down our memorials that honor our vets?” Palin said. “For shame.”
Palin has previously urged Obama administration employees to engage in acts of civil disobedience at the “Barrycades.” At the “Million Vet March”, veterans will demand that the Obama administration re-open the memorials and urge Congress to pass legislation to forbid the memorials from being closed in future government shutdowns."

On Monday, Senator Marco Rubio—whose parents famously fled Castro's Cuba before that was even a thing to do—ganged up with seven other senators (including John ""Teh Surge"" McCain and Lindsey ""Benghazi"" Graham) to unveil a bipartisan framework for comprehensive immigration reform.
No doubt this was a calculated move by Rubio; he doesn't need any GOP consultants telling him that ""send them all back"" is no longer a viable electoral strategy—but it was heroic nonetheless.
He now finds himself on the opposing side of Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the National Review; they recognize that offering millions of freeloaders a path to citizenship would be good for the Democrats, and as such, bad for the country.
On the other hand, an influx of foreign invaders would necessitate giving little womenz unfettered access to the biggest, scariest-looking guns imaginable—which is what America is all about.
Well, that and Israel, apparently.

Elsewhere...
Highly-paid mouthpiece Sarah Palin explained to Breitbart.com why she and Fox News recently parted ways. 
""I encourage others to step out in faith, jump out of the comfort zone, and broaden our reach as believers in American exceptionalism,"" she told the site. ""That means broadening our audience. I'm taking my own advice here as I free up opportunities to share more broadly the message of the beauty of freedom and the imperative of defending our republic and restoring this most exceptional nation. We just can't preach to the choir; the message of liberty and true hope must be understood by a larger audience.""

Meanwhile...
Like clockwork, The National Review chimed in with complaints about President Obama's description of Nazism. 
President Obama issued a statement yesterday to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. He noted that survivors who bore witness to ""the horrors of the cattle cars, ghettos, and concentration camps have witnessed humanity at its very worst and know too well the pain of losing loved ones to senseless violence."" [...]
The idea that all violence is ""senseless"" violence is one that has taken deep root on the left; it’s also, unfortunately, one that poses a major impediment to understanding the world.
Nazism may have been an ideology to which the United States was — and to which the president is — implacably opposed, but it is hardly ""senseless.""


And, in related news...
Idaho state Sen. Sheryl Nuxoll (R) compared the fate of insurance companies under Obamacare to that of Jews under the Nazis. 
""The insurance companies are creating their own tombs. Much like the Jews boarding the trains to concentration camps, private insurers are used by the feds to put the system in place because the federal government has no way to set up the exchange.
Based on legislation and the general process that is written toward this legislation, the federal government will want nothing to do with private insurance companies. The feds will have a national system of health insurance and they will eliminate the insurance companies.""

562,http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/17/Second-Rubio-Staffer-Argued-American-Workers-Cant-Cut-It,News,Breitbart,Democrat,Second Rubio Aide Argued Some Americans Not Cut Out for Workforce,"

A second staffer for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) disparaged American workers during an interview with Ryan Lizza, a partial transcript of the interview the New Yorker reporter released Monday afternoon shows. 
Originally, it appeared as though only one anonymous Rubio “aide” disparaged American workers and only did so in the context of speaking about low-skilled jobs in the U.S. However, the Lizza interview transcript shows two aides referenced low-skilled and high-skilled American workers.
Lizza asked the two staffers to respond to this statement: “Well their argument is, what, that they have American workers for these jobs, they don’t need this program.”
The thus-far unidentified “Rubio Aide 1” said that some workers either can’t or won’t make it in the work force anyway: 
Yeah. I mean one of the problems you have with this, “Oh, there’s American workers who are unemployed.” There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it. There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you obviously can’t discuss that publicly because–
At that point, “Rubio Aide 2” interjected, “But the same is true for high-skilled workers.”
“Aide 1” then said, “Yes, and the same is true across every sector, in government, in everything.”
Lizza’s story had originally not specified that two Rubio aides made the argument, leaving a little room for Rubio’s staff to try to discredit the reporting.
As excerpted by Politico’s Mike Allen Sunday morning, Lizza’s story reported the exchange as follows: 
Rubio sided with the Chamber against the construction workers. “There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can’t cut it,” a Rubio aide told me. “There shouldn’t be a presumption that every American worker is a star performer. There are people who just can’t get it, can’t do it, don’t want to do it. And so you can’t obviously discuss that publicly.” In the end, the wage issue was settled to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s satisfaction, and the Building and Construction Trades union won a cap on the number of visas for foreign construction workers.
After National Review editor Rich Lowry picked up on how Rubio’s anonymous “aide” disparaged American workers, and published a piece on it, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant tried to argue Lizza’s reporting was inaccurate. 
“We strongly objected to the magazine including that background quote in the piece because it’s not what Sen. Rubio believes or has ever argued,” Conant told Lowry. “In truth, Sen. Rubio has always said the reason we need a robust temporary worker program is to create legal avenues for US businesses to meet labor needs when not enough Americans apply for jobs… Sen. Rubio believes that American workers can compete against anyone in the world.”
Sen. Rubio himself gave a quote to The Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis publicly rejecting the comments. “The quote attributed to a member of my staff was a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program,” Rubio told Lewis. “It is not my view in any way. I could not disagree with it more.”
The transcript Lizza released casts doubt on whether the quote was simply “a description of one argument used against big labor’s opposition to a guest worker program.” Rather, it indicates the quotes were two Rubio staffers making the argument on their own, not in an abstract context. The transcript also shows that the two Rubio aides were talking about high-skilled and low-skilled American workers, not just those who would be part of a guest worker program.
After Lewis’s piece was published, Breitbart News reported that several immigration organization leaders and hill staffers have called on Sen. Rubio to publicly identify the aide who made those comments. NumbersUSA director of government relations Rosemary Jenks and Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian, as well as various hill staffers, called on Rubio to publicly identify the aide and terminate him or her.
On Twitter, National Review‘s Lowry asked Lizza, “i have no reason to doubt you but can you share any more of the context of that quote? rubio staff pushing bk hard.” He added that Rubio’s office’s pushback included Conant saying “the aide was describing some industries’ response to unions’ opposition to temp workers.”
When Lizza sent out the partial transcript of the interview, Lowry responded, “great, thank you. looks like you were exactly right unless im missing something.”"

You can tell just how insane the Republican Party has become when it can't even agree that prosecuting and reducing violence against women is a no-brainer. For nearly two decades, even Republicans supported the Violence Against Women Act, because what kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being would publicly take issue with that?
Well, on Tuesday, when the Senate voted, again, to re-authorize the VAWA, 22 senators—all Republicans, all men—raised their hands to proudly proclaim, ""I am that kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being!""
Let's take a look at some of these brave defenders of the sacred right to rape and beat the shit out of women:

There's Marco Rubio of Florida, the savior du jour of the Republican Party. He's the guy Republicans think will make them seem reasonable and not at all the party of old white guys because, hey, his parents are from Cuba and he speaks Spanish. Which is why, of course, he should have even greater sympathy for immigrants, and yet, for some reason, he has a real problem with VAWA protecting immigrants. Huh. Go figure.
There's Dr. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who never shies away from invoking his medical expertise to justify, say, opposing reproductive health care for women. See, when he supports laws to strip women of their rights, it's because he's a doctor, and he's simply acting out of concern for women. As a doctor. Funny that in all his years of practice, he apparently never encountered a victim of rape or domestic violence. Hell of a ""doctor,"" that guy.
There's Rand Paul of Kentucky, who thinks the government doesn't have the right to do a single thing except crawl up inside your vagina and regulate the hell out of it. Oh, and there was that one time in college when he kidnapped a woman—you know, as a joke. But hey, he probably has a really good reason for standing up for the rights of woman-beaters. Besides self-interest.
Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the very model of chivalry, so it's hard to understand his opposition. After all, he so generously offered to mansplain how math and numbers and budgets work to his fellow Wisconsinite, Tammy Baldwin, when she was elected to the Senate in 2012. Guess he's fickle that way. He'll help the girls with their math homework, but if they get beaten, they're on their own.
James Inhofe of Oklahoma doesn't want to lift a finger to combat violence against women, but that's probably because he knows it isn't a real problem. Just like he knows climate change isn't a real problem. Just like he knows properly training and protecting women who are already in combat in the military isn't a real problem. In fact, the only real problem that concerns Inhofe is how to stop The Gays from taking over the world with their big gay agenda.

You can go below the fold for the full list of Republicans who don't give a damn about women. And be sure to sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act.

Let's say, just hypothetically, you are the attorney general for the commonwealth of Virginia. So it's sort of your job to uphold and enforce the law, even the laws you don't like, because that's part of the job. You know what isn't part of the job? Advising people to break the law you've sworn to uphold.
While that might seem obvious, apparently it isn't so obvious to a certain attorney general and wannabe governor whose name is Ken Cuccinelli. (As is so often necessary when discussing Republicans, please note this is not from The Onion.)
Cuccinelli recounted an exchange with his own bishop in which he counseled the cleric to embrace civil disobedience: “My local bishop said, ‘Well, you know I told a group I’m ready to go to jail.’ And I said, ‘Bishop, don’t take this personally: You need to go to jail.’”
Lest you think Cuccinelli and his bishop were casually discussing breaking the law in a righteous battle for some greater good, you can stop that right now. Because the greater good for which these two fine Catholics think law-breaking is worthwhile is, of course, the fight to stop women from having access to basic health care because Abraham Lincoln had some good quotes about stuff and also religious liberty:
“You know, Abraham Lincoln has many good quotes, but one of them is ‘the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it vigorously.’ And here we’re going to have an example of what tyranny means when it’s played to its logical conclusion,” Cuccinelli said. “Because forcing business owners and businesses to do this is not consistent with our history of preserving religious liberty, one of the most important protections we have in this country.”
If you're scratching your head trying to figure out how encouraging civil disobedience is actually a form of ""vigorously"" enforcing the law, don't bother. It doesn't make sense, and it isn't supposed to. We're talking about Republicans, after all, and they never let a little thing, like not making a goddamned bit of sense, stop them.
For almost a year, wingnuts and Catholic bishops (and yes, in the Venn diagram, that's basically just one big circle) have been whining and stamping their feet and reciting their favorite old timey quotes because it makes them super sad to think about women having basic health care. This has not actually persuaded anyone that women having health care is a bad thing. Quite the opposite, as demonstrated by about a bazillion polls on the issue. Not like that ever stops them.
So Cuccinelli, in his run for governor, is definitely doing his best to appeal to the wingnuttiest wingnuts in his base, and damnit, he'll even advise breaking the law—contrary to, you know, his current job description—to prove that he's just the guy for them.
You can listen to the audio here. You know, if you can stomach it.

Nancy Mace, a conservative primary challenger to incumbent South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, retweeted an insult to her Twitter followers Tuesday which called her opponent a “Nancy boy.” 
She has since deleted the tweet, but the Sunlight Foundation’s “Politwoops,” which preserves tweets politicians have deleted, has the retweet on its website: 
“RT @PaulSteel4: @nancymace we support you here in Florida. Nancy Mace vs Nancy boy graham.”
“Nancy boy” is a derogatory term used to describe “an effeminate or homosexual man.”
Mace is the first female graduate of The Citadel, where her father, Ret. Brigadier General J. Emory Mace, also attended. Mace’s father is the most decorated living graduate of The Citadel.
Graham, a member of the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” that wrote the controversial immigration reform bill passed in late June, has long faced criticism for being less ideologically pure than his conservative constituents desire. 
Carolina Conservatives United (CCU), a political group created by former GOProud co-founder and conservative activist Bruce Carroll, launched the website defeatlindseygraham.org shortly before Mace announced her candidacy. CCU’s site attacks Graham for what it deems are his “Beltway Republican” values.
“The truth is Lindsey Graham only panders with conservative language once every six years,” CCU states. “But every day he shows his true stripes by bashing small government conservative activists and ‘voting wrong’ on many of the most important issues before us.”
Former South Carolina Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation Jim DeMint was asked on Tuesday’s “Daily Rundown” on MSNBC, “Do you think Lindsey Graham is a Jim DeMint conservative?”
DeMint simply answered, “I don’t think he would want to be called a Jim DeMint conservative. We’re all different. People will have to decide that for themselves.”
Host Chuck Todd then asked, “Is it fair to call him a conservative?”
DeMint replied: “Lindsey can tell you what he is himself. I’m not speaking for him.”"

Maine Gov. Paul LePage

Oh dear gawd:
Gov. Paul LePage told a group of Republicans last week that President Obama ""hates white people,"" according to two state lawmakers who say they heard the remark directly. […]
Each said LePage talked about how Obama could have been the best president ever if he had highlighted his biracial heritage. LePage said the president hasn't done that because he hates white people.
""Yeah, he said it,"" said one of the lawmakers. ""It was one little thing from a speech, but I think most people there thought it was totally inappropriate.""

Could we just have one damn Republican governor who is not a three-inch oozing sore on the face of the nation? It's beyond obvious now that Obama's mere presence in the White House has driven the full Republican Party batty—like it unhinged the last hinge on the ol' racist toolbox and now every damn tool is out there, doing radio shows and ranting about ethnic plots and getting actually elected to actual state offices by the dozens. Obama hates white people started as hoary old crap from the Limbaugh wing, a shouting promise that the scary black man was after reparations for all the black folk and punishment for all the white folk, a conspiracy theory originally tailored for that class of party adherents too stompingly stupid to wrap their heads around the complexities of birth certificates or secret Muslim plot ""urban"" voter fraud or secret Obama police force or any of the even Vaguely Goddamn Fucking Subtle race-based stuff. No, this one is for the people too stupid to figure out the blazing racial connotations of all of those other things—the people who need ""white vs. black, grr"" tattooed on the palm of their hands so that they remember who it is they're supposed to be afraid of every evening when they take their pills, and that is apparently such a large contingent of the party that it's impossible to throw a shoe in a Republican convention without hitting five of them at once.
More on LePage below the fold.


There is not one damn thing Barack Obama has ever done in his life that might convince anyone he hates white people, but there are still a small subset of extremely pasty people who are convinced of it, and the Republican Party seems to have elected most of the dumbest ones they could find to office. I don't even think LePage is just playing to the base here—I don't see any past evidence that would suggest the world give him that much credit. No, he apparently seriously, honestly believes Barack Obama goes through life figuring out how he can hurt good white pasty stupid people like Paul LePage unless people like Paul LePage figure out how to hurt him first, because that belief, expressed 20 different ways, an emotion so primitive and non-subtle that even dogs have evolved above it, is the only remaining Republican Party position on anything.
To hell with managing the affairs of the nation or making the trains run on time, or at all, or even knowing what a train might be: The only supposed core party belief that survived the Bush-to-Obama transition without spinning into a ditch was the same racial/ethnic/religious paranoias that have driven the worst of the base since the civil rights movement made all of them sad. And, since 2008, it's been boiling over because the worst of the base has to look at Obama every day and the mere presence of one of ""them"" in a position of power proves, to them, every conspiracy theory anyone ever muttered about how giving other people any rights at all will mean that now it's the good white folks turn to be oppressed; the rights of citizenship played out as zero-sum game. It's not a question of ensuring basic rights to all Americans: if those other Americans are given rights, they will use it to hurt us. It's not a question of giving Muslim Americans the same basic right to religious freedom and a place of worship that everyone else is entitled to: if we allow them to meet in our neighborhoods, soon we will be under their law. A trash conspiracy opinion, to be sure, and yet one that multiple states and lawmakers cannot move quickly or often enough to wallow in. Surely, that should be proof enough of where the heart of the party lies.
What Paul LePage said was based on racism. Terribly sorry to break it to you, old sports of the more polite media venues, but you really can't have it any other way. Whether Paul LePage is a racist, directly, I don't give a damn, but the only way you can ever get to the theory that ""Obama hates white people"" is through a thicket of racial conspiracy theories in your own head. That makes LePage no different from the vast swath of Everyone Else in his entire damn party, none of whom have any idea as to what they're doing other than the urgent belief that everything non-white-upper-class America wants is, de facto, a plot against them, and that the Republican Party is still not only electing these people but making them the models of the party ought to be proof enough that the party is an intellectual wasteland, a big loud megaphone for spouting obscene nothings that dwindling group of people too angry and dumb and bitter to figure out how to leave.

Thus is Ron Fournier's latest piece aptly titled. And to buttress such a claim – that George Bush is a good man – Fournier begins with a sweet, sappy story about our sweet, sappy former president.
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer walked into the media cabin of Air Force One on May 24, 2002, and dropped identical envelopes in the laps of two reporters, myself and Steve Holland of Reuters. Inside each was a manila card – marked by a small presidential seal and, in a simple font, “THE PRESIDENT.”
Handwritten in the tight script of President George W. Bush, both notes said essentially the same thing: “Thank you for the respect you showed for the office of the President, and, therefore, the respect you showed for our country.”
What had we done? Not much, really. An hour earlier, at a rare outdoor news conference in Germany, Steve and I decided to abide by the U.S. media tradition of rising from our seats when the president entered our presence. The snickering German press corps remained seated. “What a contrast!” Bush wrote. “What class.”

What a contrast, indeed. Except, here's the real contrast: George W. Bush treated those in the press corps who stood for him with incredible humility and grace while lying through his teeth to send those soldiers who stand for our country into a disastrous war.
Here's the contrast: while he wrote a thank-you note to Fournier, he signed off on establishing torture as a legitimate national pursuit.
Here's the contrast: while he recognized the humanity of a few journalists at an outdoor presser, he ignored the humanity of those abandoned outside, homeless and starving, in Katrina's wake.
I don't care if Bush is a ""good"" man in his private life. I don't want to hear about how he's a good father or husband or dog-owner.
Any man who lies to send soldiers to their death and begins a systematic torture program is not a good man.
End stop.

Debo Adegbile, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice



Debo Adegbile, nominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice

Like a pack of slavering Baskerville hounds, the card-carrying members of ""RRR"" (acronym meaning varies—rabid Republican racists, religiously race-baiting right-wingers, reactionary racist Repubs, right-wing racist rhetoricians, or your choice) are on the scent of their new meme of ""racialism"" and their target is one of President Barack Obama's nominee's—Debo Adegbile.
Adegbile was nominated to head-up the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.
Seems like there is a logic to selecting a lawyer to head up a civil rights division who has actual experience with (gasp) civil rights litigation. Adegbile has it.
Debo P. Adegbile is Senior Counsel to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, a position he has held since July 2013.  Previously, from 2001 to 2013, Mr. Adegbile held a number of roles at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., including Special Counsel, Acting President and Director-Counsel, Associate Director-Counsel and Director of Litigation, Associate Director of Litigation, and Assistant Counsel.
The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, has issued a strong endorsement:
Debo Adegbile is one of the preeminent civil rights litigators of his generation and a bipartisan consensus builder. His experience as the two-time defender of the Voting Rights Act in the Supreme Court puts him in a class of his own when it comes to understanding the application and enforcement of complex civil rights issues. Add that to his stellar career over ten years at the nation’s leading civil rights law firm—the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund—as well as his work in the Senate and in the private sector, and it becomes clear that Adegbile’s skill set, talents, and experience make him the perfect choice to head the Civil Rights Division.
Adegbile’s life mirrors that of the American Dream. A son of immigrants from Ireland and Nigeria, Adegbile grew up in poverty with periods of homelessness to work his way through law school and one day defend American democracy in the Supreme Court.  
Millions of Americans rely on the Civil Rights Division to enforce housing, education, and employment discrimination laws, hate crime laws, the Violence Against Women Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the core civil rights statutes that allow all of us to take part in the fullness of American life. Debo Adegbile is the right nominee to head the Civil Rights Division. We call on the Senate to swiftly confirm him.

The problem for RRR's is that Adegbile is black. Worse—from their perspective—he is black and a veteran of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (who they see as anti-white), and from a birtherist nativist xenophobic perspective clearly not ""Amurrican"" enough.  
There's that surname of his—Adegbile, which is Nigerian, from his father. And he's the son of parents who, according to Richard Cohen, are probably causing a lot of gagging, since his mom is Irish.

black friday at coach http://blackfriday2014coach.com


Just a few examples from the sewers:
National Review Online: The DOJ’s Radical Civil Rights Division; Obama’s pick to helm the division seems to hew to a racialist view of civil rights.
From comments:

Racist, Anti-White Obama Appoints Racist, Anti-White Debo Adegbile To Replace Racist, Anti-White Tom Perez.
From comments:
Shocking animal ooga booga's promoting other animal ooga booga's.
Thought Tom Perez was Radical? Meet Debo Adegbile:
But in the Obama Justice Department, the law is not as important as the cause. And with Adegbile, the cause is racialist.
We are already aware of the animus against Barack Obama's paternity, and the Kenyan father he never knew, along with the birther conspiracy theory about his nativity. So many of the racist depictions of him as an ape, simian-like, or a savage with a bone in his nose, are deeply rooted in ideations about the Dark Continent, used to maintain slavery and white supremacy.
There have been numerous studies that prove having a non-WASP name affects getting hired, an interview for a job, or entry to a specific college or university. Of course, historically that was true for names that sounded Irish or Jewish. I was fortunate to have the surname Oliver, though after marrying and becoming a hyphenated Velez, slurs of ""sp*c"", have increased.
Adegbile faces a formidable array of rationales for the vituperation unleashed against him. Bad enough to be black in America, a child of a mixed race union, and to have a clearly African first and surname, coupled with the hated resume of tenure with the NAACP, and his support of voting rights.
He expressed that support clearly in an interview done at NYU when he was chosen as Alumnus of the Month for July 2010.
Q: You also were involved in voting rights cases with the LDF during the 2000 presidential election and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. What draws you to these kinds of cases?
A. Voting rights fascinated me when I studied the topic in my constitutional law class with Professor Christopher L. Eisgruber. Leaders like Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall knew that individuals’ ability to express their political voices was essential to take down the racial caste system of Jim Crow. So many of the civil rights leaders understood that having a vote—having an ability to pick leaders and to have a full measure of citizenship—was essential to ensuring equality, not just in the moment but in the future. That lesson was not lost on me.
Q: How did you develop an interest and expertise in voting rights law?
When I studied at NYU, I had a chance to take a couple of wonderful classes on race and the law in the United States and South Africa with the late, great A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., and later I practiced with him at the Paul, Weiss law firm. He was the former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. He spent his career working as a civil rights lawyer and a federal judge, and was a passionate and unyielding voice for equality in the United States. He was very involved in a number of voting cases and was very passionate in defending the voting rights of African Americans, especially in the twilight of his career. I got to work with him as a summer associate and then as an associate at Paul, Weiss, and through that experience I participated in my first case with the LDF. So that experience set me on a path of not only caring deeply about these issues, but having an opportunity to become involved in the continuing struggle for equality.

Adegbile was exposed very early in life to concepts of justice and equality. He is an alumnus of Manhattan Country School, and sits on their board of directors. The school's mission statement reflects the man he is:
In 1966, founders Gus and Marty Trowbridge set out to create an independent school where equality, social justice, a diverse community, and the inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. would form the basis for childrens’ education. Four decades later, at a school with no racial majority, that dream has become a vibrant reality for nearly 200 students every year.
Of course his childhood association with Big Bird may not win him any applause on the right either ;)
A: I auditioned for Sesame Street during the first or second season the show was on the air. A big ""cattle call"" went out in New York City because they were looking for more kids. Off to the audition I went, and I guess I made it through without wrecking the set or acting too unruly. I filmed episodes for nine years.
At NYU, I distinctly remember taking a workshop from placement services early in my time at NYU. Their advice was to take anything you’ve done that’s interesting or different and put it on your résumé, because law firms get a lot of résumés and after a while they all start to look alike. On the strength of that advice, I put Sesame Street on my résumé. And true to form, in almost every interview, it was a substantial part of the focus. I guess that talking about the show was a lot more interesting than my views on the law or my command of legal topics – I suspect that is still the case. So in some way, I owe my career success to attending that workshop and heeding that advice.

The good news on his nomination and future confirmation is that given the rules change in the U.S. Senate, he may not be blocked. We should help make that happen.
For those of you planning to attend Netroots Nation in Detroit in 2014 and interested in hearing more from him, he is scheduled to be on a panel. Here's hoping his bio posted on the NN website will have a new addition—Debo Adegbile, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Department of Justice.

Am I the only one here who is deeply impressed with Sen. Rand Paul's insistence on playing the victim in his own plagiarism scandal? The narcissism levels are off the chart.
In an interview with National Review Online on Capitol Hill, Paul was furious, especially with the press coverage of the allegations. “It annoys the hell out of me,” Paul said. “I feel like if I could just go to detention after school for a couple days, then everything would be okay. But do I have to be in detention for the rest of my career?”
Well poor effing baby—you get caught lifting entire pages worth of material and passing it off as your own work, and your primary response is to be irritated that people keep bringing it up several days? Dear God, I don't know where our country finds these people, but we should be paying NASA some serious cash money to develop a system for sending them back there.
“What makes me mad about the whole thing is that I believe there is a difference between errors of omission and errors of intention,” he said. “We aren’t perfect and we have made errors of omission, but we never intended to mislead anybody.”
No. You cannot get caught with your hand in other people's cookie jars to the tune of thousands of words and then plead oopsie, saying you didn't mean it. Of course you meant it. Either you—the person who wrote the book with your name on it—or some random staffer—the person who actually wrote the book with your name on it—copypasted large sections of text and put them under your byline. Same for op-ed articles. Same for speeches. The only way that happens is (1) if nobody involved, despite presumably at-least-basic levels of edumacation, has the slightest grasp of what plagiarism is or (2) nobody involved cares. The good senator has still not properly elucidated which of those two things happened, but from his sad coyote howling I am guessing that he would like us to believe that Mr. Doctor Senator Rand Son Of Ron Paul is simply unfamiliar with this whole don't goddamn steal concept. How dare people ask him about these things. For multiple days in a row!
Smart people have noted that Rand Paul seems to be a more political politico than his father, a man who always was a crackpot first and a politician second. Paul the Younger inherited his father's notions but attached an ambition all his own. Short version: The bullshit force is strong in this one.
“It’s also what people hate about politics, and it’s why, frankly, members of my family are not too interested in politics, period, or wanting me to do more of this,” he said. “To tell you the truth, people can think what they want, I can go back to being a doctor anytime, if they’re tired of me. I’ll go back to being a doctor, and I’ll be perfectly content.”
That's right, America, the Rand Paul family is none too keen on politics. If you're going to keep yelling at him for stupid things like junior-high level plagiarism, well Mr. Doctor Rand Paul will just go back to his self-certified ophthalmology career. None of those people give a damn if you design your own medical accreditation and sign your name to the bottom of it. Not like you ""haters.""
So far the only consequence of Paul's serial oopsies has been the cancellation of his Washington Times op-ed column. That's right: Sen. Rand Paul has been considered too unethical for the damn Washington Times. That's got to be worth a framed certificate right there.

572,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/04/22/1203753/-Wisconsin-redistricting-scandal-deepens,News,Dailykos,Democrat,Wisconsin redistricting scandal deepens,"

 Charlie Pierce had a good mention of this on Friday, but I wanted to give you in the rest of the country a little more background on the Wisconsin GOP's lengths to conceal information regarding the state's redistricting after the 2010 elections.
  As many of you know, Wisconsin Republicans swept into power in 2010, with Governor Scott Walker taking office and the GOP taking both houses of the state legislature, as a result, this allowed them to control the redistricting process, and they locked Democrats out of the process, and held very few public hearings once the maps were revealed in Summer 2011. What they did still has not been brought completely to light, and events of this week illustrate why that is so, and why it has potential to do major damage to the GOP not only in Wisconsin, but nationwide.
A court filing on Thursday indicated that Republican staffers had deleted hundreds of thousands of files relating to the 2011 redistricting of Wisconsin. The accusation by Wisconsin Democrats was backed up by forensics expert Mark Lanterman, who has been tasked with trying to restore the information that was withheld from the original redistricting suit that allowed most of the GOP's shenanigans to remain in place. Lanterman's report shows that this wasn't a random boo-boo.
The largest volume of deletions occurred on “Sen Republican WRK 32864”. Hundreds of thousands of files (but likely less than one million) were deleted from “Sen Republican WRK 32864”on July 25, 2012. The deletions were performed by a user logged into the system as “tottman.” The files deleted include indexes, data tables, database files, and other files that appear to be associated with mapping software. The database files appear to have been created in June 2011. Among the deletions were files in folders titled “AB9Backup,” “AB9Plan,” “LegendBMPs,” “Plan Backups,” “Matrix Backups,” “Reports,” and “Saved Matrix.” These deletions do not appear to be related to any routine maintenance of the computer, because folders containing similar data but with different names were not targeted for deletion.
8. Evidence of deletions in 2012 also appears on “ASM Republican WRK 32586,” although the number of files deleted is less than that of “Sen Republican WRK 32864.” Among the items deleted was a folder titled “Draft Plans for Printing,” as well as its subfolder titled “Hispanic amendment” and all of the folders’ contents. This folder was created on January 6, 2012, and then deleted less than one minute later, by a user logged into the system as “afoltz.”
9. I have recovered a sample of ten of these deleted documents. The documents appear to be the same or similar to non-deleted documents that I located in a folder called “Projects,” located on the desktop of the afoltz user account....
10. On that same computer, “ASM Republican WRK 32586,” I have recovered four million deleted master file table (“MFT”) entries. The MFT is like a table of contents for the hard drive, tracking files by name, date, and location. When a file is deleted, the MFT entry associated with that file is also deleted. Thus, my recovery of four million deleted MFT entries would ordinarily signal the deletion of four million files. However, some of the deleted MFT entries reference files that still exist on the hard drive. In my experience, this is unusual. The only other time I have seen such a pattern is when data were deleted and then restored from a backup; the restoration brings back the file itself, leaving the deleted MFT entry.

Well, Mark Lanterman won't say it, so I will. It's obvious that these files were being used by Republicans in their redistricting scheme, but they didn't want the courts to see what they were thinking, so they're trying to to hide them and avoid court orders to turn them over. You wouldn't delete the files in one place and save them in another if you weren't trying to do that.



It's also worth remembering that the redistricting scheme was cooked up outside of the Capitol grounds, in the Madison offices of Michael, Best and Friedrich, with the idea that the GOPs ""believed the process they used granted them attorney-client privilege that would keep their communications from being disclosed publicly."" That argument went down in flames in January 2012, and the Republicans were ordered to turn over their communications related to the new maps. And among the key Legislative aides that were involved in the map-making at MBF were ""afoltz"" - Adam Foltz, an aide to then-Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald - and ""tottman"" - Tad Ottman, and aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald.
And the Democrats who made their own filing to coincide with Lanterman's findings note that the dates Foltz and Ottman had their deletion party was not coincidental.
On January 3, more than a month before trial, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request to reconvene the depositions of Messrs. Ottman and Foltz and Joseph Handrick. It again ordered those witnesses to “produce documents in their possession that have been requested by the plaintiffs.” Order (Dkt. 104) at 10. Plaintiffs’ counsel conferred with the legislature’s counsel on January 6, and the legislature produced additional documents on January 10 and 11. The January 6 deletions occurred just after the Court’s order and just before the legislature’s supplemental production. And they occurred on computers in Michael Best’s offices.
Questions about the legislature’s document productions arose immediately after the close of trial. See Mem. in Support of Post-Trial Mot. for Remedial Discovery (Dkt. 253) at 8-11.  On July 18, 2012, after majority control of the state senate shifted, the new majority leader requested Michael Best’s redistricting file. The following day (July 19), Michael Best agreed that it would make its redistricting file available for review. One week later (July 25), a user logged into the account of Tad Ottman, aide to state Senator Scott Fitzgerald—who just had been replaced as majority leader—deleted hundreds of thousands of redistricting files. The following week, Michael Best turned over its redistricting file to the new senate majority leader.

Ruh roh. And did I mention that Foltz has already testified that the new maps didn't take political implications in mind when they were done? I already said last year that this guy's looking at prison time for that perjury, but refusing to comply with court orders and deletion of evidence is a whole 'nother level of law-breaking. Hope THAT was worth it, Foltzie.
But as I like to say about WisGOP, not a lot of things with these guys are coincidental, and they come from the top. Let's face it, if you know what youngster GOP leggie aides are like these days, they are some of the biggest toolbags you can find - remote-controlled dopes who need an instructional manual to figure out what words to use on a press release.  With that in mind, did I mention that former Wisconsin GOP Chair and current RNC Chair Reince Priebus is a former Michael, Best and Friedrich lawyer, and wanted to make sure Sean ""from the Real World"" Duffy and other WisGOP Congress members could be protected. And did I also mention that his college roomate Robin Vos was very interested in what the maps would say, since it was probable that Jeff Fitzgerald and Vos had worked out an agreement that Jeff Fitzgerald would run for U.S. Senate, and Vos would move up to Speaker if the GOPs maintained their majority after the 2012 elections (which they did)?
Hilariously, Vos is quoted in the State Journal article on the latest developments as saying ""he was not in leadership during the time in question and referred questions to attorneys handling the case."" RIIIIGHT. The guy known around the Capitol as ""Boss Vos"" with a newly-installed spiral staircase in his office to have a centralized office of WisGOP communcations and ""policy research"" had no hand in what was going on in a redistricting that would help him cement power? If you believe this, then....you probably believe that Scott Walker had 5 personally-hired aides breaking the law in Milwaukee County without his knowledge, either. I may have been born at 10:02pm, but it sure wasn't last night.
Given what Lanterman describes in his filing, he's been able to get back a lot of these files that Foltz and Ottman thought they'd gotten rid of, and given that the findings are due on May 10, we'll find out what's in those soon enough. But given that the only thing that Republican socipaths seem to understand is power and money, the only suitable punishment to stop these people are to THROW THE MAPS OUT (to take away their undeserved power) and make the aides and the bosses who gave the orders GO TO JAIL for such flagratn defiance of court orders and state open records laws.
This is definitely going to blow up. It's just a question of how high up it'll go. And if the national media wants a good ""off-year"" scandal, this may be one they might want to look at, because it could be a good one.

After serving eleven terms in Congress, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) announced on Monday he will not seek reelection. “It is time for someone else,” said Bachus.
After chairing the powerful House Financial Services Committee for six years, Bachus gave up his chairmanship in 2012 following a Office of Congressional Ethics investigation. In my book, Throw Them All Out, I, along with subsequent reporting by Breitbart News, uncovered evidence of insider trading. 60 Minutes and I partnered together on an investigation that uncovered insider trading by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Bachus. Congress then passed the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act to ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.
Not surprisingly, Bachus’s friends on the committee cleared him of the charges, but not before he was forced to spend $422,000 in legal fees funded by his campaign account and another $209,000 from his legal expense trust. In true crony fashion, as Politico reported, “the bulk of Bachus’s legal defense fund take came from croporations and PACs with ties to Alabama, including Mortgage American, Inc., Bryant Bank, and Citizens Bancorp of Winfield, Inc.”
This brand of cynical, crony capitalist behavior led the late Andrew Breitbart to be the first to call for Bachus’s resignation.
“What Congressman Spencer Bachus did was wrong, vile, and an affront to the decency of the American people and the principles of honesty and fairness upon which our system rests,” wrote Breitbart. “Our Founding Fathers believed political leadership was a call to stewardship, not self-enrichment….Spencer Bachus: it’s time for you to go.”
During the summer and fall of 2008 leading up to the financial meltdown, Bachus used his post as the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee to gain access to high-level meetings with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top senior officials. The meetings were so secretive that all those attending were required to leave their cell phones outside the room so that no information would leak or be misused. Bachus then executed a series of expertly-timed stock trades that resulted in as much as $50,000 (politicians report in ranges, not specific amounts) in capital gains from July to November 2008. Put simply, even as everyday Americans’ personal portfolios were going up in smoke, Bachus used material, non-public information to protect and profit his own portfolio.
“Spencer Bachus did something I believe is unforgivable–he sold out his country by shorting stocks during the worse days of the financial collapse,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News. “Spencer Bachus will always be an emblem of everything wrong with the ‘District of Corruption.’ Good riddance.”
Free markets flourish only when those who claim to champion them abide by the rule of law. Ironically, Bachus’s actions helped mobilize and reinvigorate the foot soldiers in the economic freedom movement; on November 17, 2011, Tea Party members assembled outside Bachus’s Alabama offices in protest. Their efforts sent a strong signal that true capitalists believe in competition and fairness–not insider access to top secret government information that can be used to subvert markets and poach profits. 
“Spencer Bachus holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only member of Congress that Andrew Breitbart called on to resign, and that includes Anthony Weiner,” said Larry Solov, CEO and President of Breitbart News.
Spencer Bachus will soon be gone, yet the fight against the cronyism continues. Here’s hoping it won’t take another Spencer Bachus to keep the free market torch alight."

Oh wait, they're already here ...



Oh wait, they're already here ...

John Boehner may have decided that he'd rather not plunge the United States into default quite just yet, but the true believers? They're mad. Really, really mad. A roundup of arsonist reactions:
Speaker Pelosi Part 2:  Opening Jan 5. 2015
— @DRUDGE



Rush Limbaugh:
Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday blasted the Republican Party as “irrelevant” and responsible for “creating one of the greatest political disasters” he’s ever seen.
“I was trying to think earlier today, if ever in my life I could remember any major political party being so irrelevant,” the conservative radio host said on his show, according to a transcript. “I have never seen it. I have never seen a major political party simply occupy placeholders, as the Republican Party is doing.”

Rush says the party still refuses to offer ""serious opposition"" to Obama, again claiming that this is because Obama is black.
Hardliner and actual CNN contributor Erick Erickson, or maybe he's not there anymore because who the hell watches CNN these days:
I am tired of funding Republicans who campaign against Obamacare then refuse to fight. It’s time to find a new batch of Republicans to actually practice what the current crop preaches.

The Tea Party Nation is very, very sad:
Barack Obama demanded unconditional surrender from the Republican Party. He pretty much got it. […]
In short, the GOP got nothing from their fight. But then again, McConnell, Boehner and the GOP establishment never tried.


As are a great many of the arsonists themselves, lighters still in hand:
Must be kidding. After 15 days and no proposal by Obama or Reid, GOP leadership may pass Democratic deal for them? http://t.co/...

FreedomWorks and Club For Growth are frothing and foaming.
FreedomWorks: ""The line separating the Democrats and the Republican establishment is fading- it might have disappeared today.""
— @philipaklein



But House conservatives like Raul Labrador know what the real problem with their plan was. It's the fault of that damn meddling media for saying House Republicans wanted to repeal Obamacare instead of calmly explaining that the Republicans merely wanted to reasonably exchange defunding or delaying the law in exchange for allowing the federal government to continue to function. Stop painting us as unreasonable!
""We never asked for a full repeal of Obamacare because we can't get that,"" he said. ""We have voted on a full repeal of Obamacare that the Senate has rejected every single time. But what we were asking for, our position from the beginning, was exchanging a one-year CR for a one-year delay of Obamacare. That was something we thought both sides were giving on something.""


Much more, below the fold.



It wouldn't be a conservative civil war if the other side wasn't returning fire, and there's been plenty of that. For their part, the Houston Chronicle repudiated their own endorsement of Ted Cruz, apparently flummoxed that Cruz's brand of hardline far-right conservatism did not transform itself into something less insane once he gained office:
When we endorsed Ted Cruz in last November's general election, we did so with many reservations and at least one specific recommendation - that he follow Hutchison's example in his conduct as a senator.
Obviously, he has not done so. Cruz has been part of the problem in specific situations where Hutchison would have been part of the solution.


And when you've lost Grover Norquist, you've lost the last thread tying yourself to supposed ""fiscal"" conservatism. Not that Norquist has any interest in tying himself to conservatism these days either, so ragged has the brand become:
“It’d be a good idea if they stopped referring to other Republicans as Hitler appeasers because they opposed the strategy they put forward which failed,” Norquist says. “I think if you make a mistake as big as what they did, you owe your fellow senators and congressmen a big apology — and your constituents, as well, because nothing they did advanced the cause of repealing or dismantling Obamacare.” […]
“These are the people who said, ‘Plan: Step One, Invade Iraq. Step Two, It turns into Kansas,’” Norquist says. “Could I ask if there’s anything in between Step One and Step Two? ‘Oh ye of little faith.’”


For his part, House Speaker John Boehner may yet keep his position after all of this—despite no apparent plan, ability to execute that plan, ability to hold his caucus in line, ability to count, ability to negotiate, ability to clearly articulate what exactly the damn demands were besides opening up a unicorn brothel for conservative House members. The general feeling among the arsonists is that well, at least he let them have a good solid go at it:
Speaking at an event with fellow conservatives, Labrador said he was “really proud” of Boehner’s handling of the fiscal crisis and that, over the last two-and-a-half weeks, “he has been the kind of Speaker I’ve been looking for for the last two-and-a-half years.” […]
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told The Hill, ""conservatives feel like he's fought the good fight .... You can quote me on that.""


But perhaps the most (ahem) ""interesting"" pro-Boehner premise paints him as a true genius who did all of this because well that was the plan all along you see.
By allowing Ted Cruz to shut down the government, and by accepting the strategic advice of the idiots at Heritage Action, Boehner taught the rank and file a lesson that they probably won’t forget any time soon.  Following the advice of those bozos will get you nowhere fast.
Yes. He only hurled himself down the stairwell to teach all you other chumps what happens when you do that. A brilliant plan indeed.

As for how this will all pan out? Who knows. Perhaps true conservatives will split off into a third party. Perhaps true conservatives will lock themselves in the wardrobe, refusing to come out until Narnia shows itself. Perhaps true conservatism will yet again be redefined in order to pretend this whole sorry episode never took place. Once Obama is out of office, that is. In the meantime, we'll be doing all of this all over again, from scratch, in just a few short months. That's  just how America rolls now, baby.

Sen. Pete ""Baby daddy"" Domenici

Don't you just love the smell of a Republican sex scandal in the morning?
Former New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici told the Journal on Tuesday he fathered a son outside of his marriage over 30 years ago, revealing a secret kept for decades.
Statements given to the Journal by Domenici and the son’s mother, Michelle Laxalt of Alexandria, Va., identified the son as Adam Paul Laxalt, a Nevada lawyer. Michelle Laxalt formerly was a prominent government relations consultant and television political commentator in Washington, D.C. She is a daughter of former U.S. senator and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt. [...]
Michelle Laxalt said “one night’s mistake led to pregnancy” and she chose to raise the son as a single parent.

Now, far be it from us to judge what happens behind closed doors between consenting adults. After all, it's really no one's business if the former senator of New Mexico was diddling a colleague's daughter behind his wife's back. Clearly, such a private matter is nobody's business, and we should all stay out of it.
Oh, unless that senator happens to believe that the government has a vested interest in what happens behind closed doors between consenting adults, women have no right to privacy at all, and adultery ""rise[s] to the level of impeachable offenses that the Founding Fathers envisioned.""
Like Sen. Pete Domenici did when he was wandering the halls of the Senate in his pajamas. In which case, all bets are off. Head below the fold to find out why.


See, while Domenici was keeping his dirty little secret out of respect for his baby mama and his out-of-wedlock offspring, he was whistling a slightly different tune in public. Like when he voted to convict President Bill Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial because, among other things, ""[t]ruthfulness is the first pillar of good character in the Character Counts program of which I have been part of establishing in New Mexico."" Also, something about the president's ""tawdry"" sex acts, although it totally wasn't about that at all.
In fact, when he was a senator, Domenici was perfectly happy to invade the privacy of others and legislate what happens between consenting adults. Like all his votes to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Like all his votes to regulate vaginas—because while he believed that the woman he impregnated had a right to privacy, that right does not extend to women he didn't impregnate.
But at least, classy guy that he is, Domenici has finally come clean—decades later—to his family, and he's very sorry:
I deeply regret this and am very sorry for my behavior. I hope New Mexicans will view that my accomplishments for my beloved state outweigh my personal transgression. I only ask that everyone respect the privacy of my family and the son’s mother. None of them wanted this publicity, none of them deserve the hurt of this revelation, and only I should bear the brunt of this matter.
Yeah. Sure is awful when people think what happens in your private life is somehow their business, isn't it?

In between the fog of all the budget talk, our screwed-up and corrupted Supreme Court also was in the headlines this week. First was the release from Supreme Court Justice Ann Walsh Bradley recusing herself from a potential discipline hearing against the ""man"" accused of choking her, fellow Justice David Prosser. Bradley said that when Prosser attacked her
what happened in my office on June 13, 2011 was not an isolated event. Rather, it is one event in a history of abusive behavior in our workplace that has escalated from tantrums and rages, to threats, and now to phyiscal contact.
Bradley went on to say that she and Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson have taken to locking themselves in their offices out of fear of their safety, as they find Prosser unstable.
The Walker Administration tried to run interference and claim that they couldn't find a record of such a request, no doubt to try to feed the Charles Sykeses and Mark Bellings a meme that Bradley was lying.  But former Capitol Police Chief Charles Tubbs backed up Bradley's account Friday afternoon, saying that Capitol Police were indeed contacted by a ""Supreme Court official,"" and put in a security plan soon thereafter.
But hey, maybe Bradley was overreacting. I mean, look at the grace in which Prosser handled being interviewed on the incident.

That doesn't look like an unstable maniac, does it?
What kept Prosser from facing criminal charges for the incident was the fact that the other 3 right-wing members of the Court - Michael Gableman, Annette Ziegler and Pat Roggensack - claimed the incident did not happen or that Prosser was somehow provoked and threatened by Bradley (who is significantly shorter and smaller than Prosser), so there wasn't enough unquestioned evidence against Prosser to charge him.
Roggensack was also called out by Bradley in her complaint, as Bradley said Roggensack deceived investigators about what happened that June day, and was lying when Roggensack claimed earlier this month that things really aren't that bad between the justices. Given that a key attack against Roggensack in the upcoming Supreme Court election will be that she is part of the problem with the Court's embarrassing dysfunction (along with her partisan, conservative record), you can see why she might want to say something like that.
But an ethics case remains from the incident, with Franklyn Gimbel as the head prosecutor for the state's Judicial Commission.  That was also in the news this week because the Journal-Sentinel had a story where Gimbel said he had been told not to add any new evidence or scopes to the Prosser investigation by the state's Judicial Commission.


This is where things get interesting, and the cover-up angle becomes more obvious. As Patrick Marley writes in the Journal-Sentinel,  
Since Gimbel began work on the case, the makeup of the commission has changed so that it is now controlled by Walker appointees. Among the commissioners are people recommended by John Gard, a lobbyist, former Republican Assembly speaker and former aide to Prosser when he was in the Legislature. In recommending the appointees, Gard told an aide to the GOP governor they were ""fiercely conservative"" and would ""never wimp out.""
Gimbel would not disclose what other options he provided to the commission to consider for continuing the case. Some legal observers have said the effort should be directed at [Judge Richard] Brown, the chief of the appeals court, because state law says the appeals court chief ""shall select the judges"" on the judicial panel and does not specify a role for the Supreme Court in establishing the panel.

One of those that has called for Brown to take case on his own is Tom Foley at the Illusory Tenant blog, and his breakdown of this ongoing saga is worth the read from an ""inside the legal profession"" standpoint.
But in addition to ""fiercely conservative"" judges, know what else John Gard lobbies for? The school voucher movement, which has already thrown over $20,000 toward Justice Roggensack's re-election campaign, a contribtuion Roggensack didn't report until One Wisconsin Now tracked and exposed the contribution themselves. Roggensack is often the swing vote that favors Gov. Walker and the Wisconsin GOP, like she was in the Act 10 decision in 2011 (which lifted off the whole ""Prosser choking Bradley"" incident). The right-wingers in Wisconsin know they might need Patty's vote for issues such as voter ID, domestic partnerships and marriage equality, and worker rights.
When you put this together with the Walker Administration ""not having a record"" of Bradley's complaint against Prosser, you can see where there might be more than a little coordination between the Governor's Office, the Judicial Commission, and the Roggensack campaign in making sure nothing else happens. Because these guys don't want people to be reminded of how this Court has fallen apart under right-wing rule, and how it has been a willing partner in the breakdown of Wisconsin's former reputation of clean government, as they might become very willing to kick out one of the people who has allowed the corruption and unchecked power to go on- Pat Roggensack.
The fact that the Wisconsin righties are going to such lengths to lie and protect Prosser and Roggensack is all the more reason you should throw her out, and pull the lever for Ed Fallone this Tuesday, and on April 2. I know I will.

Smoke rises as water is sprayed at the burning remains of a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas



Smoke rises as water is sprayed at the burning remains of a fertilizer plant in the town of West, Texas

Texas secessionist Gov. Rick Perry:
Gov. Rick Perry on Thursday declared McLennan County - home to West, the small community rocked by the deadly fertilizer plant explosion - a disaster area and announced that he's asking President Barack Obama for a federal emergency declaration as well.
That's not an unreasonable request, and the victims of the fire and the residents of West deserve it. (Even if West Fertilizer Co should ultimately pay the costs for gross negligence.)
Still, it's curious seeing Perry run to the feds after hearing his secessionist rhetoric because of the ""oppressive"" federal government. And he's joined in the hall of hypocrisy by the rest of the area's federal delegation.
U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, whose district includes West, called on all Americans to pray for the victims of this tragedy [...]
""I am grateful for all of the police, fire, emergency responders and volunteers from our community and around the state who have come to aid those in need,"" he said. ""Our offices will continue to monitor the aftermath and be on hand to assist our friends and neighbors throughout the recovery process.""

How does Flores plan on assisting? By asking for federal aid presumably (his prayers won't accomplish anything tangible), the same kind of federal aid he voted against for Sandy victims.
""It was too large,"" Flores said about the latest bill Wednesday. “It does more than meet the immediate needs of Sandy victims.""
Flores, whose district includes Waco, said he could have supported an earlier version of the bill with $17 billion in aid if it had been offset by federal spending reductions.

Then there are the two Texas senators:
U.S. Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz of Texas released a joint statement saying they are among those grieving for those who were injured or lost loved ones in the blast.
""(We) are grateful to the firefighters and first responders who risked their own lives to keep others safe,"" they said. ""We ask all Texans to keep West in their thoughts and prayers. We remain in communication with Gov. Perry's office and emergency management officials, and stand to offer whatever support we can.""

Both Cornyn and Cruz voted against Sandy aid as well, of course. What kind of aid do they think they are proposing for West? Aside from their prayers, that is.
Again, the federal government will and should absolutely lend resources to the town's recovery. But perhaps the state's politicians should be less hostile toward similar aid to other parts of the country. Otherwise, the people of West and their neighbors should reconsider reelecting people like Flores with 80 percent of the vote.
Either we're all in this together, or we're not.

Today, there are reports that the far-right America destroyers, the Koch Brothers, are out to gobble up the Tribune Company-owned newspapers and possibly its TV Stations.
You though Rupert Murdoch was bad? Just wait till you meet the Kochtopus.
Think Progress Media:
The Koch brothers own Koch Industries, the second-largest private company in America, and bankroll a network of Tea Party groups and Republican political war chests.
In 2012, the brothers spent millions to defeat President Obama and even sent mailers to employees urging them to support Mitt Romney and other conservative candidates.
The Hollywood Reporter:
David and Charles Koch, billionaire industrialists who own Koch Industries, America's second-largest privately held company, have expressed interest in the Tribune Co. newspapers. The Chicago-based empire emerged from a long bankruptcy Dec. 31 and has hired investment firms Evercore and JPMorgan Chase as offers have come in for its print properties.
Tribune Co. spent more than four years in bankruptcy after being purchased by Sam Zell. Following the company's emergence from chapter 11, it named TV industry veteran Peter Liguori, formerly of Fox Entertainment and News Corp., as its CEO. Several Hollywood figures sit on its board of directors, including Ross Levinsohn, CEO of Guggenheim Digital Media, parent company of THR.
The Koch brothers have long dominated American industry; their holdings include Georgia Pacific paper products as well as major fertilizer, refinery and oil pipeline companies. More recently they have become known for their financial support of Republican candidates, especially those from the Tea Party, and the fight against regulations and legislation aimed at curbing climate change.

LA Weekly's Hillel Aron:
The latest rumor about the next owner of the L.A. Times, which is for sale, is a doozy. A bombshell. It's a doozy wrapped in a bombshell exploding inside a Drudge siren.
Multiple sources tell L.A. Weekly that Charles and David Koch -- the infamous right-wing billionaire brothers -- are considering an offer on either the Tribune Co. newspaper group, which includes the L.A. Times, the Chicago Tribune and the Baltimore Sun or the entire Tribune Co., which includes more than 20 stations like WGN and KTLA Channel 5.
The Koch Brothers are most famous for spending boatloads of money on Republican and libertarian political candidates and causes, favoring lower taxes, fewer regulations and weakening union influence.
It's hard to believe there's a chance that the liberal and Hollywood-adjacent Los Angeles Times might one day be owned by the Koch Brothers.

This past week, the Republican Party asked Americans to join in the celebration marking the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library. In addition to offering ""Thanks W"" stickers (fittingly available only in black and white), visitors to the GOP.com website can sign an e-card thanking President Bush ""for his hard work and dedication to the principles that make America great!"" (Hat tip to Deadhead.)
The outpouring of gratitude to the 43rd president has been overwhelming, not just from Americans but from people around the world.  Below are just some of the touching W thank you notes which have flooded in so far:

Unlike almost every governor, U.S. Senator, House Member, and state legislator, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker did not graduate from college.
According to his wiki entry about his time at Marquette he presumably wrote:
He enrolled at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1986. He attended college for four years but never graduated, working part-time for IBM selling warranties. His IBM job led to a full-time position in marketing and fundraising at the American Red Cross from 1990 to 1994.
snip
Walker made his first try for government office in 1990 at age 22, winning the Republican nomination for Milwaukee's 7th District seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly, but losing in the general election to incumbent Democrat Gwen Moore. He moved to the predominantly Republican edge city of Wauwatosa, when its Assembly seat opened up in 1993, winning the special election.

So, according to the semi-official bio, Walker left college in his senior year to run for State Assembly, and after losing went to work for the Red Cross.
Sure, Walker was ambitious, but most ambitious pols earn at least a bachelor's before running for office, or find a way to complete the degree after the campaign.
Perhaps Walker had no choice about leaving Marquette after four years, but still about a year short of getting a degree.
That's what Glen Barry, a Marquette contemporary of Walker, thinks.
Details, below.  
 


Charlie Pierce, a Marquette alumnus who has memorably named Walker ""the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin,"" linked to Barry's remembrance of Walker at Marquette this way in a post well worth reading ""The Wisconsin Recall Is About One Thing: No More Him"":
A former Marquette classmate has written about Walker's time on the Avenue, and intimates quite clearly what has been a persistent rumor in alumni circles -- that Walker was asked to leave Marquette due to some academic shenanigans. Thus far, Walker has declined to release his college transcripts, so the question remains open. Noonan's Law applies — is it irresponsible to speculate? It would be irresponsible not to.
Barry, who graduated and went on to earn a Ph.D. from UW Madison, recounts Walker's dirty campaigning for two campus-wide offices, both of which he lost.
There are many delicious details at the link, including the college newspaper concluding that Walker was ""unfit for office"" due to his being ""sanctioned for illegal campaigning on numerous occasions, and brutal personal attacks upon his opponent’s character."" Plus, ""Walker’s campaign was secretly and systematically (stealing and) throwing out copies of the newspaper that endorsed his opponent"" (prior to the ""unfit for office"" editorial), and newspapers never like that kind of theft.
But the key bit is this:
I wish I could say definitely why he never graduated – it is a closely guarded secret. I believe the general line of thinking – that Scott Walker was caught cheating.
Well, that makes sense.
Walker was not a good student -- he has refused to release his transcripts, but his 2010 campaign said that his GPA was 2.59.
And then there's the timing issue -- Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986 and left sometime in 1990, which is four, or three and a half at least, years.
Yet he was substantially short of the credit hours required for graduation:
Walker released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. He had 94 credits and would have needed at least 36 more. The exact number of credits he needed isn't clear because students must take classes in certain areas of study to get degrees.
Somewhere along the way, Walker lost a year's worth of college credit.
Maybe, in the two years he was running for college offices, he took some incompletes that he did not make up.
Maybe his parents decided they did not want to fund a five-year plan.
Maybe Walker got caught cheating, and was told to get out of Marquette and not return.
So he didn't.
Walker's ancient history is, IMHO, far more relevant than Romney's prep-school bullying or Obama's teen-age drug use -- Walker was a far-right pol in training at Marquette, his college campaigns were wingnut, dirty and fact-free, and he moved as quickly as possible into political office.
In the words of Babu Bhatt, Walker is a very, very bad man.
And has been since Marquette.
Tom Barrett needs lots of help to retire Walker, those of you with credit cards can help here.

Wowza. Rachel just devoted the first two segments of her show to the growing scandal surrounding Virginia Governor Bob ""Ultrasound"" McDonnell. The timing of this attention is thanks to a story broken last night by The Washington Post:
RICHMOND — A prominent political donor gave $70,000 to a corporation owned by Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell and his sister last year, and the governor did not disclose the money as a gift or loan, according to people with knowledge of the payments.
The donor, wealthy businessman Jonnie R. Williams Sr., also gave a previously unknown $50,000 check to the governor’s wife, Maureen, in 2011, the people said.
The money to the corporation and Maureen McDonnell brings to $145,000 the amount Williams gave to assist the McDonnell family in 2011 and 2012 — funds that are now at the center of federal and state investigations.
Williams, the chief executive of dietary supplement manufacturer Star Scientific Inc., also provided a $10,000 check in December as a present to McDonnell’s eldest daughter, Jeanine, intended to help defray costs at her May 2013 wedding, the people said.

http://www.washingtonpost.com/...
Yowch. Maddow said that the 50,000 dollars to the Governor's wife was an example of, ""if it's a gift to the governor, it has to be reported, but if it's to the wife, maybe it can be kept secret"" (paraphrased)


Rachel also tallied up all the other gifts the same donor gave Governor Bob and family:
A $6,000 Rolex watch that the Governor dishonestly claimed was a gift from his wife.
A multi-thousand dollar suede Oscar De La Renta jacket for the wife.
A multi-thousand dollar Louis Vuitton handbag, also for the wife.
2 pairs of sooper fancy shoes for the wife.
An expensive designer dress for the wife.
These are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.
Rachel then showed excerpts of an interview the Governor gave yesterday, in which he said the donor ""received nothing"" in exchange for all these riches. Rachel quickly proved this was a lie. He got a launch party at the Governor's mansion for his 'magic quit smoking drug'. He also got meetings with state officials regarding the same drug. And the Governor's wife has also been criss-crossing the country touting the awesomeness of this drug. The donor even got a photo of the Governor himself smiling as he holds up a bottle of said drug. ""Nothing"", Governor? really?
But Rachel wasn't done. There's apparently a second scandal, in which the Governor charged thousands of dollars to the state for 'off to college' supplies for his children. She enumerated those as well, from snack foods to toiletries.
Rachel brilliantly reminded viewers that the Governor receives a yearly salary of $175,000, but that all this stuff was not paid for with that money. What a grifter!
I thought Rachel couldn't have been more thorough in her take-down of Señor Ultrasound. But after the break, she had a Virginia State Senator with her, live, who demanded that Governor McDonnell resign immediately.
Go Rachel! I will try to post the video the moment it becomes available.
10:55pm ET - video not available yet, but The Rachel Maddow Show has exclusive access to the Governor's financial disclosure statements from 2008 to the present:

Update 1.5:
My diary fails to mention that in these segments, Rachel also describes VA Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli's deep involvement in this same scandal. He, too, has received thousands of dollars worth of gifts from the same donor. You may know Ken as the one trying to recriminalize oral and anal sex in Virginia, among other talibantastic endeavors. And, he's running to replace McDonnell as Governor! Not. Gonna. Happen. (h/t sofa turf and Rosalie907)

Cross posted from Blue Virginia
The HuffPo is out with a potentially explosive story, assuming that it's accurate. Check this out.
Republican state legislators in Virginia want so badly for the public to forget about the state's recent legislative battles over abortion that they have tried to strike a deal with Democrats to keep them quiet, a Democratic aide told The Huffington Post on Friday.
According to the legislative aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment (R) began meeting with Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw (D) in early December to discuss what state lawmakers have been referring to as a ""grand bargain"" on women's issues. According to the terms of the alleged deal, Democrats would lay low on the abortion issue in the media and drop efforts to repeal controversial anti-abortion laws that the Virginia General Assembly has recently passed, and in return, Republican leadership would send one GOP vote over to the Democrats' side on any new piece of anti-abortion legislation that is introduced in order to ensure that it does not pass. (The Virginia State Senate has 21 Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, and 20 Democrats.)
""It's about keeping media off the topic,"" the aide said. ""If Democrats came out swinging trying to repeal some of these laws, it's going get media coverage. [Republicans] really just want a state of neutrality.""



Clearly, that makes ZERO (or less than ZERO if that's possible) sense from the Democrats' point of view. In terms of policy, of course, the last thing we want to do is to acquiesce in any way to Virginia Republicans' incessant war on women's health and reproductive freedom. Politically speaking, the last thing we want to do, as we head into a crucial gubernatorial election year against one of the poster boys for the war on women (presumptive Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli - yeah, this lunatic!), is to let Republicans off the hook for their ""personhood"" amendments; their ""transvaginal ultrasounds;"" their efforts to shut down women's health, family planning and abortion clinics across the state; etc. We certainly DO NOT want to keep this out of the media, to hush it up, or to lay low on this subject. A thousand times NO!
Thankfully, Democratic Attorney General candidate, State Senator Mark Herring (D-Loudoun, Fairfax), is all over this one.
Update: 4:59 p.m. -- Herring told The Huffington Post on Friday that no kind of bargain among Senate leadership could keep him from trying to repeal the abortion clinic regulations.
""Nobody's going to be able to muzzle me on these issues,"" he said. ""I wont be a part of any kind of a deal like that. This is about fighting for what's right for women.""

That about sums it up right there, thanks to Sen. Mark Herring for putting it so clearly. The bottom line: no way in HELL should we agree to back off our defense of women's reproductive freedom, health, and liberty! To the contrary, as Sen. Herring clearly understands, we should be redoubling our efforts to protect Virginia women's health from extremists' attacks. If you agree with this goal, please sign Sen. Herring's petition, and ""Tell Ken Cuccinelli and Bob McDonnell: Hands off women’s healthcare!""  Thanks.

Here's a NY Times profile on Jerry Brown of CA:
But these days, Mr. Brown — who at 75 is the oldest governor in the nation and about to become the longest-serving governor in the history of California — is enjoying a degree of success and authority he and his opponents could scarcely have imagined when he returned to Sacramento to begin a second tour as governor in 2010.
Republicans usually tout their governors, but that's mostly because they can't tout their Congressional people. How can they, when their entire schtick is ""send me to hated Washington where I swear to do nothing (and less than my predecessor)""?
Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei on how much it sucks to be a Republican these days:
It is almost impossible to find an establishment Republican in town who’s not downright morose about the 2013 that has been and is about to be. Most dance around it in public, but they see this year as a disaster in the making, even if most elected Republicans don’t know it or admit it.
Several influential Republicans told us the party is actually in a worse place than it was Nov. 7, the day after the disastrous election. This is their case:
• The party is hurting itself even more with the very voters they need to start winning back: Hispanics, blacks, gays, women and swing voters of all stripes.
• The few Republicans who stood up and tried to move the party ahead were swatted into submission: Speaker John Boehner on fiscal matters and Sen. Marco Rubio on immigration are the poster boys for this.
• Republicans are all flirting with a fall that could see influential party voices threatening to default on the debt or shut down the government — and therefore ending all hopes of proving they are not insane when it comes to governance.

At this fragile moment in Egypt’s political awakening, the performance of its government will be a more important determinant of its legitimacy and durability than whether it won an election.

Eventually, what you throw out into the world comes back to you.   I grew up with Bob Dole.   I had dinner with him once, he came to our house as a child, we visited him in his office in Washington DC.
Today, there would be issues I would have with Bob Dole on the policy front, but despite all of that, I never felt as a youth or now that Dole didn't ""say what he meant, mean what he said"" or that he wasn't willing to work with others.  
Today, the Boston Globe lays out exactly what is wrong with the Republican party from Dole's perspective.
http://www.boston.com/...
Dole was 89 years old, just out of the hospital, working the phones to win senators’ support. Then, in a dramatic effort, he rolled in his wheelchair onto the Senate floor, all but daring senators to vote against him and, by proxy, anyone with a disability.
It was a moment Dole had long awaited. He had brought the parties together to pass his greatest piece of legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which required the retrofitting of buildings and sidewalks and provided an array of other rights.
Now he wanted the Senate to approve an international treaty that would spur other nations to pass their version of the law, making the United States a role model to help tens of millions of people around the world.



It was an event in the late eighties, my brother had just won the state National Geographic bee.   Suffering from a broken arm and forced to lay on a mat on the stage, he pressed on to have one of those weekends we will all remember.
We received cards from several, but it was a phone call from our senator - Robert Dole - that came across to let us know that he was proud of the effort and wanted to talk.   The only issue on the list of those around us surrounded basic rights - especially for the disabled.   Senator Dole came to a town event early the next year, stopped in and laid out why working toward the Americans with Disabilities Act was important to him.  
Giving people a chance to participate in society was the way to move things forward; and that the most important role of government was to allow more people to participate in every level.
Now, twenty years later, former Senator Dole sees what his party has become and tells us something is very wrong.
As Dole sat in his Washington law office in February, still stunned by the outcome, he blamed his own party and suggested a headline: “Republican Party closes its doors to make repairs.” The GOP, added Dole, one of the party’s most revered figures, “needs a timeout” to tone down the antigovernment rhetoric.
The article is chock full of quotes that describe the problem with the current leadership of the republican party.
They saw their job as meeting halfway. “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something,” Dole said.
Supporters hoped the time was right to win ratification. Of the 193 countries in the United Nations, 155 have signed the treaty and 129 have ratified it, including countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, and Russia. In an effort to win Republican support, treaty backers asked Dole to take up the fight. The old warrior, while weakened from his most recent hospitalization, promptly agreed.
No one disputed the difficulties faced by many of the 1 billion people worldwide with disabilities; in many developing countries, most children with disabilities don’t go to school and have little chance of gainful employment, not to mention basic accommodation, according to the State Department. Ratifying the treaty, supporters said, would spread American leadership around the globe as well as create new markets for US-made disabilities products.

Senators James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Jim DeMint of South Carolina, favorites of the Tea Party, wrote an op-ed for The Washington Times that said the treaty “calls for government agents to supersede the authority of parents of disabled children and even covers abortion.”
Dole and other supporters of the treaty viewed the charges as laughably false. The treaty legislation clearly stated that it required no change in US law, and there were no new abortion rights, they said.

Republicans turned their backs on those who were part of one of their greatest victories.  
I can remember sitting in a room listening to Senator Dole tell us how he always held a pen in his hand - a hand he couldn't really use due to a war injury, because as a younger man from the war the sign of disability made it harder for him to get respect; and holding a pen in his hand was a way to seem as though he was doing something and to hide a disability.   His story was a moving moment to how a person understood directly the issues that face those who are disabled.
I am not here to rah-rah a Republican Senator who I'm sure we all would have many policy disagreements with.   But I am here to remember a Republican Senator who pushed through the Americans with Disabilities Act.   He put forward the Clean Air Act.  
I read the article at the Boston Globe and remember that at one point, Dole was right "" “I thought when I was elected I was supposed to do something""
Too bad the current Republicans believe they are elected to make sure nothing happens.  A nation cannot move forward if leadership from 20 years ago looks infinitely more progressive then a current implementation of a party.  While everyone else tries to move forward, the modern Know-Nothings do everything in their power to take as many steps back as possible.

Go to Healthcare.gov... see for yourself.
See who has been working for you... and who has been working against you.
The truth is out there just for you to see.

The extremist tea party wing of the Republican Party—aka ""Teapublicans""—who are currently holding the government and citizens of the United States hostage with threats of economic terrorism are certainly equal opportunity haters.
Yes, I'm using the word ""hate"" to describe what seems to motivate much of what they have wrought. It's ironic coming from a group that is largely and ostensibly ""Christian,"" given that their actions are the antithesis of the love-based theology of Jesus. Even more ironic, since they claim to be patriots and do a lot of flag-waving and talking about how much they love America.  
My focus over the years has primarily been on their racism, their open visceral rejection of a black president, but that is too narrow a lens through which to view all of the people their hate is bringing harm to. Their actions go beyond mere Obama Derangement Syndrome.
Most of the folks in their cross-hairs are white, and contrary to the impression given by their propaganda many are Republicans. Anyone who does not share their warped and twisted views of “their America” will now be forced to suffer.
So take a good hard look at the people who were elected to serve in a government they have vowed to destroy and all of the groups who have fallen afoul of their vengeance, those who are going to be made to pay and pay, to suffer by the actions taken by this deranged minority group.
It's a long list—and I'm probably leaving some groups out—but follow me below the fold to view it:


Government workers
Women (unless they are supporting patriarchy)
Blacks (AfricanAmericans as well as African and Caribbean immigrants)
Latinos (especially those who are not Cuban-American anti-Fidelistias)
Asians and Asian-Pacific Islanders
Native Americans
LBGT’s (Log Cabin Republicans beware)
Union members
Immigrants (documented and undocumented, who are visibly non-white)
Jews
Muslims
Sikhs and Hindus (because from a hater's perspective they are no different from Muslims)
Atheists
The elderly
The disabled
Children in Head Start
Moms, infants and children on WIC
People with pre-existing health conditions
People who need food and food stamps (America's hungry)
People living from paycheck to paycheck
Farmers
Scientists
Active duty military, vets and their families
People who believe in climate change
People who believe in evolution
Environmentalists
People whose income depends on tourism to national parks
Teachers/educators
Librarians and students (book bannings are being called for)
The media (unless it is FAUX-news or hate radio personalities)
Democrats—liberal, centrist or conservative
The incarcerated (all two million of them) and correction officers
In other words—the vast majority of folks in the U.S seem to fall into some group Teapublicans are taking out their ire upon.
It’s amazing to me when I add up the numbers.

My first face-to-face encounter with Teapublicans was back in 2010, in my neighboring town of Kingston, New York, which I wrote about in a piece called ""Social Justice is Tyranny,"" the title taken from one of the many signs held up by people with hate-filled faces.
Trying to talk to them was futile. They were opposed to paying taxes, yet wanted the government to keep its dirty hands off their Medicare. They had been fed on a steady diet of anti-government sentiment and conspiracy theories from Faux News. Their heroes are the Glenn Becks and Rush Limbaughs of the world.
I had a strong feeling then that we were going to be in trouble as a nation if these people, and people like them, were going to elect representatives who held their views. Yes, they didn't win the presidency (twice), but their elected cabal in Congress could care less. They don't recognize him as legitimate.
These people are not rich. They depend on government services. Yet their hate, deeply rooted in fear, keeps them from voting in their own interest.
Democracy Corps' ""Republican Party Project"" has recently issued a report from focus groups conducted with the three main factions that currently comprise a majority of the Republican Party, which helps to illuminate the forces behind the Teapublican shutdown:
Evangelicals. Social issues are central for Evangelicals and they feel a deep sense of cultural and political loss. They believe their towns, communities, and schools are suffering from a deep “culture rot” that has invaded from the outside. The central focus here is homosexuality, but also the decline of homogenous small towns. They like the Tea Party because they stand up to the Democrats.
Tea Party. Big government, Obama, the loss of liberty, and decline of responsibility are central to the Tea Party worldview. Obama’s America is an unmitigated evil based on big government, regulations, and dependency.  They are not focused on social issues at all. They like the Tea Party because it is getting “back to basics” and believe it has the potential to reshape the GOP.
Moderates. Moderates are deeply concerned with the direction of the country and believe Obama has taken it down the wrong path economically. They are centrally focused on market-based economics, small government, and eliminating waste and inefficiency. They are largely open to progressive social policies, including on gay marriage and immigration. They disdain the Tea Party and have a hard time taking Fox News seriously.

In the analysis of the focus group results (PDF) they point out:
And while few explicitly talk about Obama in racial terms, the base supporters are very conscious of being white in a country with growing minorities. Their party is losing to a Democratic Party of big government whose goal is to expand programs that mainly benefit minorities. Race remains very much alive in the politics of the Republican Party.
The first two groups are holding any elected moderate Republicans (a minority) hostage, just as they hold all of us hostage to their obsessions, paranoia, and hate.
The most important thing we each can do is fight this in every district currently controlled by Teapublicans.
MoveOn/PPP has identified seats that could be vulnerable:
Twenty-four new surveys in GOP-held House districts, commissioned by MoveOn.org and conducted in the wake of the government shutdown, make clear that Republicans could easily lose control of the House if the next election were held today. The surveys challenge conventional wisdom that gerrymandering has put the House out of reach for Democrats and indicate the shutdown has significant electoral implications.
Yes, 2014 elections are a year away.

“Karl Rove is bad news for the Republican Party.”  
With those words Donald Trump officially joined the ongoing battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party by aligning himself as a defender of the tea party and a merciless critic of Karl Rove and his new, controversial initiative known as the “Conservative Victory Project.”
Trump’s fiery appearance on The Mark Levin Show signaled an escalation in the very public argument that has played out over the past ten days between divergent factions of the GOP.  

Trump and Levin hit Rove where it really hurts.  First Trump criticized Rove’s effectiveness as a campaign strategist by slamming his SuperPAC, American Crossroads’ performance in the 2012 election: “Four hundred million dollars was wasted.  They do the worst ads I have ever seen, ever.”  
Levin followed up with what might be the most significant line of attack against Rove:  “I would say to the wealthy donors out there, ‘Why do you keep donating to him?’ why don’t you donate to all these groups who are actually grassroots, who are actually fighting and who are actually effective?”
The combination of the influential voice of Mark Levin challenging donors to shut-down the flow of cash to the Rove machine, coupled with Trump (one of those high-profile donors) repeating FIVE TIMES the fact that Rove spent “four hundred million dollars” with no results to show for it could have a brutally devastating effect on the former Bush strategist’s balance sheet.
Trump then positioned himself as the defender of the tea party movement:  “If the Republicans are going to win, they’re going to have to break away from the Karl Rove’s of the world and, frankly, get more about you know the tea party…  they are great Americans, they love this country, they work so hard, and they have been so mistreated by the liberal press, the liberal media. They have been just so mistreated and made to look so bad.” 
The continuing battle playing out on cable news, talk radio and on influential websites will surely continue now that Trump has entered the fray.  And with stalwart Republican names like Rove and Barbour on one side and Bozell and Schlafly (now joined by Levin and Trump) on the other, this could shape up to get even uglier as the battle wages on.

James Ives

Emily Ramshaw at the Texas Tribune writes:
As recently as 2003, the president of the Greater Fort Bend County Tea Party had a very different title: director of propaganda for the American Fascist Party.
James Ives, a prominent Tea Party activist who has hosted statewide rallies and political debates and has been a regular contributor on conservative radio, was the AFP's fourth in command, commenting about the party’s principles on a fascist message board. An image of Ives in what appears to be a black uniform with yellow shoulder patches can be seen in a 2006 promotional video for the party.
Ives tells a more nuanced story; the Richmond, Texas, resident says he stumbled across the fascist party — which supports extreme right-wing authoritarian regimes — online in the early 2000s as an “amateur political science student and frustrated novelist” and was merely curious.

Just curious. Uh-huh. Thought he would ""blow the lid off of this"" by getting involved, he told the Tribune. He said it was just a ""funny story.""
In the promotional video, which I won't link but can be found at youtube.com/watch?v=9aqXEN5iDpQ, you can see Ives in a black uniform at the 36-second mark. He claims the uniform was Photoshopped on.
The group's founder, Seth Tyrssen, ran for president in 2004 and self-published a book, The New Fascism, in 2009.
Ives admitted to the Tribune that he was, in fact, the group's propaganda director because nobody else volunteered for the post. But he claimed that the fascist group was just ""a chat room with a fancy title."" I also won't link it, but the message board can be found at //groups.yahoo.com/group/americanfascistparty/messages/340. One of Ives's sprinkling of messages there begins:
Gentlemen, first let me say that I am proud to be a member, no, VERY proud to be a member of the American Fascist Party. In the growth of this group over a short time, there can truly be said to be signs of light in the tunnel of recent national history. THE VERY FACT THAT SUCH A GROUP CAN GET TOGETHER AT ALL, AND FLOURISH, SAYS THAT THERE IS STILL LIFE IN THE FURROWS AND HILLS, THE BAYOUS AND GLENS OF OUR AMERICA!
While what apparently was a brief connection to a short-lived organization nearly a decade ago might not bother some people, not everyone feels that way:
State Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, whose radio station has regularly hosted Ives’ political commentaries in recent years, said that if his past connections to the American Fascist Party were legitimate, the station would no longer put him on air. Patrick said Ives had “never been on our payroll, never been an employee.” He called the promotional video and online postings “very disturbing, no matter how far in the past it is.” [...]
Debra Medina, a well-known Tea Party activist who ran against Gov. Rick Perry in the 2010 Republican primary, said she isn’t familiar with Ives and isn’t in a position to judge his dealings with the fascist group. But she said part of the challenge of working with the grassroots is that it’s “so hard to know who you’re working with sometimes.”

Yep. Hard to avoid rubbing elbows with wackos when you're one yourself.

Cross posted from Blue Virginia
From the latest (3/24/13) Northern Virginia Tea Party Newsletter, these people are seriously - as in, this apparently isn't parody - opposing the proposed ""Soviet"" Arlington County streetcar project because of...wait for it...Agenda 21. What is this evil known as Agenda 21, you ask? How about ""a non-binding, voluntarily implemented action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development?"" Crazy, I know. And speaking of tinfoil-hat crazy, Glenn Beck opposes it because...""This used to be called America. Now it is just 'the Republic.' There is no president. No congress. No freedom. There is only Agenda 21."" And it all starts with a seemingly innocuous streetcar line in Arlington County, Virginia. Shuddderrrrr... (snark)


P.S. Needless to say, I strongly urge non-Tea-Party Arlingtonians to come out in large numbers Wednesday evening to express your support for the streetcar, and to say NO to John Bircher/tinfoil hat nuttiness.

UPDATE: And now for some sanity from Arlington County Board member Jay Fisette:
Streetcar Town Hall - to be held on Wednesday, March 28, 6:30-9 pm at the Kenmore Middle School auditorium and dedicated to a discussion of the Columbia Pike Streetcar. The Town Hall is open to the public and will update the community on our planned streetcar system, discuss next steps and answer questions.  After many years of planning and a multitude of community meetings, both the Fairfax and Arlington County Boards accepted our professional staff recommendations and chose the modern streetcar as the transit system for Columbia Pike in 2006. The streetcar will run about 5 miles from Skyline in Fairfax to Pentagon City, where it will connect to another streetcar line that will run through Crystal City to Potomac Yard.  Both boards reaffirmed that choice in 2012 while applying for federal funding to help fund the streetcar.  
The projected $250M to construct the Columbia Pike streetcar would be covered by federal (30%), state (14%), Fairfax (14%) and Arlington (42%). The Arlington funds would come from a dedicated Transportation Capital Fund generated from a state-authorized surcharge on commercial real estate.  Despite widespread misunderstanding, these funds cannot be used for education, housing, public safety or anything except transportation.  
I have supported the streetcar since 2006, though I know that some have questions or concerns.  I encourage folks to attend this Town Hall. To learn more about the Columbia Pike Streetcar plan, visit here and here.

591,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/04/22/1203753/-Wisconsin-redistricting-scandal-deepens,News,Dailykos,Democrat,Wisconsin redistricting scandal deepens,"

 Charlie Pierce had a good mention of this on Friday, but I wanted to give you in the rest of the country a little more background on the Wisconsin GOP's lengths to conceal information regarding the state's redistricting after the 2010 elections.
  As many of you know, Wisconsin Republicans swept into power in 2010, with Governor Scott Walker taking office and the GOP taking both houses of the state legislature, as a result, this allowed them to control the redistricting process, and they locked Democrats out of the process, and held very few public hearings once the maps were revealed in Summer 2011. What they did still has not been brought completely to light, and events of this week illustrate why that is so, and why it has potential to do major damage to the GOP not only in Wisconsin, but nationwide.
A court filing on Thursday indicated that Republican staffers had deleted hundreds of thousands of files relating to the 2011 redistricting of Wisconsin. The accusation by Wisconsin Democrats was backed up by forensics expert Mark Lanterman, who has been tasked with trying to restore the information that was withheld from the original redistricting suit that allowed most of the GOP's shenanigans to remain in place. Lanterman's report shows that this wasn't a random boo-boo.
The largest volume of deletions occurred on “Sen Republican WRK 32864”. Hundreds of thousands of files (but likely less than one million) were deleted from “Sen Republican WRK 32864”on July 25, 2012. The deletions were performed by a user logged into the system as “tottman.” The files deleted include indexes, data tables, database files, and other files that appear to be associated with mapping software. The database files appear to have been created in June 2011. Among the deletions were files in folders titled “AB9Backup,” “AB9Plan,” “LegendBMPs,” “Plan Backups,” “Matrix Backups,” “Reports,” and “Saved Matrix.” These deletions do not appear to be related to any routine maintenance of the computer, because folders containing similar data but with different names were not targeted for deletion.
8. Evidence of deletions in 2012 also appears on “ASM Republican WRK 32586,” although the number of files deleted is less than that of “Sen Republican WRK 32864.” Among the items deleted was a folder titled “Draft Plans for Printing,” as well as its subfolder titled “Hispanic amendment” and all of the folders’ contents. This folder was created on January 6, 2012, and then deleted less than one minute later, by a user logged into the system as “afoltz.”
9. I have recovered a sample of ten of these deleted documents. The documents appear to be the same or similar to non-deleted documents that I located in a folder called “Projects,” located on the desktop of the afoltz user account....
10. On that same computer, “ASM Republican WRK 32586,” I have recovered four million deleted master file table (“MFT”) entries. The MFT is like a table of contents for the hard drive, tracking files by name, date, and location. When a file is deleted, the MFT entry associated with that file is also deleted. Thus, my recovery of four million deleted MFT entries would ordinarily signal the deletion of four million files. However, some of the deleted MFT entries reference files that still exist on the hard drive. In my experience, this is unusual. The only other time I have seen such a pattern is when data were deleted and then restored from a backup; the restoration brings back the file itself, leaving the deleted MFT entry.

Well, Mark Lanterman won't say it, so I will. It's obvious that these files were being used by Republicans in their redistricting scheme, but they didn't want the courts to see what they were thinking, so they're trying to to hide them and avoid court orders to turn them over. You wouldn't delete the files in one place and save them in another if you weren't trying to do that.



It's also worth remembering that the redistricting scheme was cooked up outside of the Capitol grounds, in the Madison offices of Michael, Best and Friedrich, with the idea that the GOPs ""believed the process they used granted them attorney-client privilege that would keep their communications from being disclosed publicly."" That argument went down in flames in January 2012, and the Republicans were ordered to turn over their communications related to the new maps. And among the key Legislative aides that were involved in the map-making at MBF were ""afoltz"" - Adam Foltz, an aide to then-Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald - and ""tottman"" - Tad Ottman, and aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald.
And the Democrats who made their own filing to coincide with Lanterman's findings note that the dates Foltz and Ottman had their deletion party was not coincidental.
On January 3, more than a month before trial, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ request to reconvene the depositions of Messrs. Ottman and Foltz and Joseph Handrick. It again ordered those witnesses to “produce documents in their possession that have been requested by the plaintiffs.” Order (Dkt. 104) at 10. Plaintiffs’ counsel conferred with the legislature’s counsel on January 6, and the legislature produced additional documents on January 10 and 11. The January 6 deletions occurred just after the Court’s order and just before the legislature’s supplemental production. And they occurred on computers in Michael Best’s offices.
Questions about the legislature’s document productions arose immediately after the close of trial. See Mem. in Support of Post-Trial Mot. for Remedial Discovery (Dkt. 253) at 8-11.  On July 18, 2012, after majority control of the state senate shifted, the new majority leader requested Michael Best’s redistricting file. The following day (July 19), Michael Best agreed that it would make its redistricting file available for review. One week later (July 25), a user logged into the account of Tad Ottman, aide to state Senator Scott Fitzgerald—who just had been replaced as majority leader—deleted hundreds of thousands of redistricting files. The following week, Michael Best turned over its redistricting file to the new senate majority leader.

Ruh roh. And did I mention that Foltz has already testified that the new maps didn't take political implications in mind when they were done? I already said last year that this guy's looking at prison time for that perjury, but refusing to comply with court orders and deletion of evidence is a whole 'nother level of law-breaking. Hope THAT was worth it, Foltzie.
But as I like to say about WisGOP, not a lot of things with these guys are coincidental, and they come from the top. Let's face it, if you know what youngster GOP leggie aides are like these days, they are some of the biggest toolbags you can find - remote-controlled dopes who need an instructional manual to figure out what words to use on a press release.  With that in mind, did I mention that former Wisconsin GOP Chair and current RNC Chair Reince Priebus is a former Michael, Best and Friedrich lawyer, and wanted to make sure Sean ""from the Real World"" Duffy and other WisGOP Congress members could be protected. And did I also mention that his college roomate Robin Vos was very interested in what the maps would say, since it was probable that Jeff Fitzgerald and Vos had worked out an agreement that Jeff Fitzgerald would run for U.S. Senate, and Vos would move up to Speaker if the GOPs maintained their majority after the 2012 elections (which they did)?
Hilariously, Vos is quoted in the State Journal article on the latest developments as saying ""he was not in leadership during the time in question and referred questions to attorneys handling the case."" RIIIIGHT. The guy known around the Capitol as ""Boss Vos"" with a newly-installed spiral staircase in his office to have a centralized office of WisGOP communcations and ""policy research"" had no hand in what was going on in a redistricting that would help him cement power? If you believe this, then....you probably believe that Scott Walker had 5 personally-hired aides breaking the law in Milwaukee County without his knowledge, either. I may have been born at 10:02pm, but it sure wasn't last night.
Given what Lanterman describes in his filing, he's been able to get back a lot of these files that Foltz and Ottman thought they'd gotten rid of, and given that the findings are due on May 10, we'll find out what's in those soon enough. But given that the only thing that Republican socipaths seem to understand is power and money, the only suitable punishment to stop these people are to THROW THE MAPS OUT (to take away their undeserved power) and make the aides and the bosses who gave the orders GO TO JAIL for such flagratn defiance of court orders and state open records laws.
This is definitely going to blow up. It's just a question of how high up it'll go. And if the national media wants a good ""off-year"" scandal, this may be one they might want to look at, because it could be a good one.

What's Michele thinking?
Who knows?

The juicy tale of how batshit crazy Rep. Michele Bachmann screwed over her presidential campaign staff is fast becoming the greatest soap opera EVER!
First, we learned that Bachmann is refusing to pay five staffers unless they sign a nondisclosure agreement that prohibits them them from talking to any reporters or police about any ""unethical, immoral, or criminal activity"" they may have witnessed during the campaign. And it seems they did witness some, um, questionable activities—including stealing an email list from a home-schooling group.
Then, because leaking that story did not motivate Bachmann to open the checkbook and just pay her damn staff, her especially bitter former field coordinator, Peter Waldron, started dishing the dirt about how Bachmann was basically mind-controlled by her debate coach, whose ""Rasputin-like"" relationship was so powerful, he even forbade her own husband from sleeping in the same room with her on the trail. Which, as we all know, must have been just devastating for poor Marcus.
In today's episode of why you should probably not refuse to pay staffers who know an awful lot of juicy things about you and your potentially illegal campaign activities:
A top adviser in Michele Bachmann's 2012 White House bid has filed a complaint with federal election officials alleging campaign finance violations involving her presidential campaign and the independent political action committee she leads. [...]
Waldron, formerly Bachmann's national field coordinator, is accusing the campaign of improperly dipping into money from MichelePAC to pay longtime fundraising consultant Guy Short for presidential campaign work he performed in the critical final weeks ahead of Iowa's caucuses last year.
Waldron also alleges that the campaign concealed payments to Iowa state campaign chairman Kent Sorenson, a state senator who abruptly left the Bachmann camp to join then-U.S. Rep. Ron Paul's insurgent campaign.

Call me Bachmann-crazy, but I don't think Waldron is going to shut up until he gets a check in his hands. Here's hoping, anyway. Tune in tomorrow ...

Am I the only one here who is deeply impressed with Sen. Rand Paul's insistence on playing the victim in his own plagiarism scandal? The narcissism levels are off the chart.
In an interview with National Review Online on Capitol Hill, Paul was furious, especially with the press coverage of the allegations. “It annoys the hell out of me,” Paul said. “I feel like if I could just go to detention after school for a couple days, then everything would be okay. But do I have to be in detention for the rest of my career?”
Well poor effing baby—you get caught lifting entire pages worth of material and passing it off as your own work, and your primary response is to be irritated that people keep bringing it up several days? Dear God, I don't know where our country finds these people, but we should be paying NASA some serious cash money to develop a system for sending them back there.
“What makes me mad about the whole thing is that I believe there is a difference between errors of omission and errors of intention,” he said. “We aren’t perfect and we have made errors of omission, but we never intended to mislead anybody.”
No. You cannot get caught with your hand in other people's cookie jars to the tune of thousands of words and then plead oopsie, saying you didn't mean it. Of course you meant it. Either you—the person who wrote the book with your name on it—or some random staffer—the person who actually wrote the book with your name on it—copypasted large sections of text and put them under your byline. Same for op-ed articles. Same for speeches. The only way that happens is (1) if nobody involved, despite presumably at-least-basic levels of edumacation, has the slightest grasp of what plagiarism is or (2) nobody involved cares. The good senator has still not properly elucidated which of those two things happened, but from his sad coyote howling I am guessing that he would like us to believe that Mr. Doctor Senator Rand Son Of Ron Paul is simply unfamiliar with this whole don't goddamn steal concept. How dare people ask him about these things. For multiple days in a row!
Smart people have noted that Rand Paul seems to be a more political politico than his father, a man who always was a crackpot first and a politician second. Paul the Younger inherited his father's notions but attached an ambition all his own. Short version: The bullshit force is strong in this one.
“It’s also what people hate about politics, and it’s why, frankly, members of my family are not too interested in politics, period, or wanting me to do more of this,” he said. “To tell you the truth, people can think what they want, I can go back to being a doctor anytime, if they’re tired of me. I’ll go back to being a doctor, and I’ll be perfectly content.”
That's right, America, the Rand Paul family is none too keen on politics. If you're going to keep yelling at him for stupid things like junior-high level plagiarism, well Mr. Doctor Rand Paul will just go back to his self-certified ophthalmology career. None of those people give a damn if you design your own medical accreditation and sign your name to the bottom of it. Not like you ""haters.""
So far the only consequence of Paul's serial oopsies has been the cancellation of his Washington Times op-ed column. That's right: Sen. Rand Paul has been considered too unethical for the damn Washington Times. That's got to be worth a framed certificate right there.

Poor Republicans are stuck with him.



Poor Republicans are stuck with him.

From the Republican National Committee's post-mortem:
As part of the Growth and Opportunity Project’s effort, focus groups were conducted in Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa, to listen to voters who used to consider themselves Republicans. These are voters who recently left the Party.
Asked to describe Republicans, they said that the Party is “scary,” “narrow minded,” and “out of touch” and that we were a Party of “stuffy old men.” This is consistent with the findings of other post-election surveys.

Sounds like a real problem! So what should the GOP do about it?
The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself. We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.
Translation: ""Our conservative media bubble is killing us"". And it is. But there's nothing the RNC can do about it, because rather than shrinking, the conservative media machine is growing. The likes of Breitbart and the Tea Party News Network exist because the conservative base considers Fox News too liberal. Saxby Chambliss was too liberal for these crazies. CPAC won't allow any gays in, or Chris Christie, the one guy who might make 2016 interesting.
That ever-expanding search for ideological purity is shrinking the GOP tent and further radicalizing conservatives to the point that they can no longer function in polite society. Meanwhile, they further alienate every growth demographic while costing them easy Senate holds and pickups.
It's quite the quandary! But if the solution is forcing Rush Limbaugh off his soapbox, then there is no solution. They built this monster, now they live with it.

  In an unexpected segment on NBC Nightly News, Brian Williams turned to Chuck (It's Not My Job) Todd to report on the driving force behind the government shutdown: a group of about 80 Republicans in the House from very conservative districts. Video doesn't seem to be available yet, but a tweet from Todd gives a hint: Tune in on @nbcnightlynews for a look at the conservative engine inside the House GOP  At the moment the comments seem to show a leaning towards blue sentiments, with a few red stater types weighing in, plus some who are too disgusted to even think about it.
       The quick version as best I can recall, is, roughly 80 House Republicans were tagged as using the budget as a hammer to force concessions on Obabmacare, in a letter they signed back in August sent to the House leadership. A look at them shows they come from districts where they won by large majorities and President Obama lost by a big margin. In other words, they expect to feel no political heat back home for shutting down the government.
        Two of them (whose names escape me) were interviewed briefly. My impression is that they were both quite pleased with having shut down the government, because they believe Obamacare is just too ""onerous"". They were elected in 2010, after the bill creating the ACA passed into law; they didn't get to vote on it so they're taking it upon themselves to stop it any way they can.
    Charles P. Pierce has their number right here:
In the year of our Lord 2010, the voters of the United States elected the worst Congress in the history of the Republic. There have been Congresses more dilatory. There have been Congresses more irresponsible, though not many of them. There have been lazier Congresses, more vicious Congresses, and Congresses less capable of seeing forests for trees. But there has never been in a single Congress -- or, more precisely, in a single House of the Congress -- a more lethal combination of political ambition, political stupidity, and political vainglory than exists in this one, which has arranged to shut down the federal government because it disapproves of a law passed by a previous Congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the Supreme Court, a law that does nothing more than extend the possibility of health insurance to the millions of Americans who do not presently have it, a law based on a proposal from a conservative think-tank and taken out on the test track in Massachusetts by a Republican governor who also happens to have been the party's 2012 nominee for president of the United States. That is why the government of the United States is, in large measure, closed this morning.
        While Todd's report doesn't get as colorful as that of Pierce, it does make very clear that the government of the United States has been shut down at the behest of a minority of the House Republican Party, representing a fraction of the United States and and even smaller fraction of the voting public.
       This may be as close as we get to seeing a major news outlet lay this on a bunch of GOP ideologues. It will be interesting to see if anyone else picks up on this, or it sinks back into the ""one hand - other hand"" school of reporting.
   If NBC puts the video clip up, I'll try to link to it.
     Meanwhile, the next report up was about how the first day of the Healthcare Exchanges opening up was marked by huge numbers of people crashing websites as they tried to find out more and sign up for insurance...
UPDATE: HERE'S THE VIDEO (thanks to Phil S 33 for finding it) It's a remarkable report from a mainstream news organizations that for once doesn't waffle about what's really behind the government shutdown. This is one to Facebook and share as widely as possible.

UPDATE 2: Tip to Jacoby Jonze, who links to this Ryan Lizza New Yorker article that is the apparent source for Todd's report. Names, map, and a lot more detail. Lizza calls the GOP extremists ""The Suicide Caucus""; let's hope this doesn't turn into one of those murder-suicide stories. These people, it should be said, are determined to deny millions of their fellow Americans access to health care, and they don't care what the body count will be.
UPDATE 3: While there are some complaints that Todd didn't push his two interview subjects hard enough on their stand or otherwise explain what's happening in as great detail as might be desired, the issue is now out there and the rest of the media just might start to run with it. Example - NY Times

A very frightened, 11 year old little girl conjured up the courage to ask her Congressman, Republican Scott DesJarlais, a question at the Murfreesboro,TN town hall meeting he was hosting on Thursday evening. Josie Melina spoke into the microphone with a quivering voice. She introduced herself to the crowd and said, ""Mr. DesJarlais, I have papers, but I have a dad who's undocumented. What can I do to have him stay with me?"" She was so scared, her question was barely audible (despite the microphone), so she had to repeat the question. Only one or two people can be heard clapping in support of this brave girl. That, in and of itself is shocking -- to think that grown-ups wouldn't support a young child in such an intimidating situation by applauding her courage...but, no. The crowd, consisting mostly of Tea Party Republicans, didn't applaud. At least, not until the Congressman gave his bully response.


After graciously thanking the young lady for her question, Congressman DesJarlais coldly replied, ""The answer still kind of remains the same, that we have laws and we need to follow those laws and that's where we're at."" The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, most assuredly crushing this already shaken child.
According to ProgressivePopulist.org:
Josie's father is currently in deportation proceedings and she is undergoing therapy to deal with the anxiety.
The whooping and cheering of this Tea Party crowd must have been devastating to Josie. I want to cry for her. I want to hold her. I want to tell her how frightened I would be if I were in her shoes. I want to square off with everyone who cheered her family's demise, and ask them, ""Have you no compassion???"". And I want her Congressman to care. But clearly he doesn't, so I want to do everything I can to help a Democrat win that seat in Congress.
As it turns out, Congressman DesJarlais is quite embattled with scandal. According to Raw Story:
Desjarlais is a former physician and anti-choice crusader who was fined $500 by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners after it came to light that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs with female patients. When one woman became pregnant, the staunch anti-abortion conservative pressured her into terminating the pregnancy. Another patient charged that Desjarlais prescribed narcotic painkillers to her for recreational use and frequently smoked marijuana with her.
The Nashville City Paper sheds more light on this guy's lack of moral ground:
But court transcripts released the week after last November's election revealed that he admitted under oath to eight affairs, encouraged a lover to get an abortion and used a gun to intimidate his first wife during an argument.
So, this guy is a real family values guy -- Republican Style. Turns out, even the Republicans don't want him. NBC recently reported he ranked No. 1 on a list of ""Top 10 Lawmakers Who Could Lose A Primary Next Year"", and he is being challenged by two other members of his own party. Hopefully, they will all destroy each other in a 3-way primary, especially since Derjarlais's seat could potentially go to the democrats in the next general election.
Enter State Senator Eric Stewart.

According to The Murfreesboro Post:
Less than a week after winning the Democratic Party primary, state Sen. Eric Stewart is pushing for his Republican opponent to participate in three debates...
...As of Tuesday afternoon, DesJarlais had not yet commented on whether he has decided to participate in the debates...

My first question for Senator Eric Stewart: How would he respond to young Josie Melina? Let's hope it would be a compassionate response. Something like what Obama might say:
""When nursing mothers are torn from their babies, when children come home from school to find their parents missing ... when all this is happening, the system just isn't working and we need to change it,"" Obama declared during his first run for president in 2008. A year ago, he told a Texas audience that deportation should target ""violent offenders and people convicted of crimes; not families, not folks who are just looking to scrape together an income.""
Which brings us back to the plight of Josie Melina and her family.
I began to search for answers for this young girl and her family. I came away from my research even more despondent for Josie than when I began. I ran across an AP article written almost exactly a year ago titled, ""Parents Deported, What Happens to US-Born Kids?"" In heart-wrenching detail it describes what can happen to these families.
Nearly 45,000 such parents were removed in the first six months of this year, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Behind the statistics are the stories: a crying baby taken from her mother's arms and handed to social workers as the mother is handcuffed and taken away, her parental rights terminated by a U.S. judge; teenage children watching as parents are dragged from the family home; immigrant parents disappearing into a maze-like detention system where they are routinely locked up hundreds of miles from their homes, separated from their families for months and denied contact with the welfare agencies deciding their children's' fate.
At least 5,100 U.S. citizen children in 22 states live in foster care, according to an estimate by the Applied Research Center, a New York-based advocacy organization, which first reported on such cases last year.
And an unknown number of those children are being put up for adoption against the wishes of their parents, who, once deported, are often helpless to fight when a U.S. judge decides that their children are better off here.

This is the easy part of the story, as this part is filled with statistics and data. The rest contains anecdotal stories that will tear your heart out. I encourage everyone to read this article, as hard as it is.
I leave you with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network's video of the entire exchange between a very brave Josie Melina, her despicable Congressman, and the horrendous Tea Party response. I'm sure this video will work wonders for the Republicans as they reach out for the Hispanic vote:

Rep. Michele Bachmann's former chief of staff will tell an Iowa Senate ethics panel that the congresswoman made improper payments to the state chairman of her presidential campaign, the Minneapolis Star Tribune's Kevin Diaz reports  ... SNIP ...
The investigation in Iowa is one of at least three ongoing investigations into the congresswoman's presidential campaign. There is also a Federal Election Commission probe and one from the Office of Congressional Ethics. Authorities also reportedly opened a criminal investigation into the alleged theft of a email list by Sorenson from a campaign volunteer. As Diaz notes, the investigations are part of a growing web of legal problems facing Bachmann.
Salon
When your former chief of staff provides an affidavit that you made improper payments it is a little hard to claim that there's no fire beneath all that smoke.
More below the Orange Squiggle of Power.


From the Minnesota Star Trib:
Gilmore said Parrish can provide the ethics panel documentary evidence that Sorenson was paid $7,500 a month to work on Bachmann's campaign, money that was funneled to him indirectly through C&M Strategies, a Colorado-based company controlled by Bachmann fundraiser Guy Short.
Parrish is the former CoS. Gilmore is his lawyer. The money came from Bachmann's independent PAC, which makes it almost impossible for her to claim innocence - not that reality and logic have much to do with her speech.
Parrish's willingness to go public against his former employer and political mentor is likely to send shock waves through Minnesota GOP circles, where both he and his attorney are well-known figures.
Parrish served as deputy campaign manager of last year's unsuccessful effort to pass a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Gilmore is a well-known conservative blogger.

The Minnesota GOP has some problems, oh yes they do. And that's what happens when one of the leading figures in the state party is a lunatic grifter ... come to think of it, that really doesn't narrow it down to Minnesota.
Michele has other problems than making illegal payments to Mr. Sorenson. Sorenson allegedly stole a proprietary mailing list from a volunteer's computer, and the police are investigating that. Congressional investigators are looking into her conflating her book tour and her Presidential campaign - good thing Newt Gingrich is no longer in Congress.
It will be a sad day for Kossacks when Michele Bachmann retires from Congress. Who will take her place as the March to Madness champion of the GOP? Only time will tell! There are certainly no shortage of candidates in the party for which facts are optional.
And somehow, this reminds me of Ms. Bachmann's modus operandi.

Today, Ari Fleischer unintentionally admitted in public what we have long suspected: that he, and many conservatives like him, are sanctimonious, gluttonous fools motivated to good only by self-serving interests.
For here is his response today to the newly-struck ""fiscal cliff"" deal:



I increased donations to charity in 2012. This deal limits my deductions so I, & many others, will likely donate less in 2013.
— Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) January 1, 2013


Now, I don't know if he's correct about the deductions limits, and frankly, I don't care. Because at issue here is that Fleischer, in a moment of oblivious candor, admitted that he and ""many others"" like him will donate less to charity in the coming years. Why? Because it will no longer be in their financial interest to do so.
So much for empathy. So much for genuine compassion. So much for this: What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul?
Not that any of this is surprising, for today we got plenty of reminders that empathy is not a Republican value. After all, just today Peter King (rabid Islamophobe) went apoplectic over Boehner's refusal to bring a Hurricane Sandy relief package up for a vote. Oh, and the House GOP allowed the 18-year-old Violence Against Women act to expire because ""the bill is too supportive of immigrants, the LGBT community, and Native Americans.""
Yes, we know callousness to be a contemporary Republican value. And Fleischer's Tweet merely admitted this fact.
However, he was appalled to have done so, for after pulling back the curtain today, Fleischer tried to yank it shut, tried to walk back what he had already revealed:

Poor Republicans are stuck with him.



Poor Republicans are stuck with him.

From the Republican National Committee's post-mortem:
As part of the Growth and Opportunity Project’s effort, focus groups were conducted in Columbus, Ohio, and Des Moines, Iowa, to listen to voters who used to consider themselves Republicans. These are voters who recently left the Party.
Asked to describe Republicans, they said that the Party is “scary,” “narrow minded,” and “out of touch” and that we were a Party of “stuffy old men.” This is consistent with the findings of other post-election surveys.

Sounds like a real problem! So what should the GOP do about it?
The Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself. We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to like-minded people, but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with, or welcoming to, those who do not agree with us on every issue.
Translation: ""Our conservative media bubble is killing us"". And it is. But there's nothing the RNC can do about it, because rather than shrinking, the conservative media machine is growing. The likes of Breitbart and the Tea Party News Network exist because the conservative base considers Fox News too liberal. Saxby Chambliss was too liberal for these crazies. CPAC won't allow any gays in, or Chris Christie, the one guy who might make 2016 interesting.
That ever-expanding search for ideological purity is shrinking the GOP tent and further radicalizing conservatives to the point that they can no longer function in polite society. Meanwhile, they further alienate every growth demographic while costing them easy Senate holds and pickups.
It's quite the quandary! But if the solution is forcing Rush Limbaugh off his soapbox, then there is no solution. They built this monster, now they live with it.

Most politically astute and knowledgeable people remember that it was President Ronald Reagan who began the assault on our unions by taking on the Professional Air Traffic Controllers union (PATCO).  By refusing to negotiate with the union regarding pay and working conditions, and hiring replacements (i.e., scabs) to take their jobs, he set the stage for the ongoing eradication of unions and the working middle class. As The New York Times noted in 2011:
More than any other labor dispute of the past three decades, Reagan’s confrontation with the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or Patco, undermined the bargaining power of American workers and their labor unions. It also polarized our politics in ways that prevent us from addressing the root of our economic troubles: the continuing stagnation of incomes despite rising corporate profits and worker productivity.
By firing those who refused to heed his warning, and breaking their union, Reagan took a considerable risk. Even his closest advisers worried that a major air disaster might result from the wholesale replacement of striking controllers. Air travel was significantly curtailed, and it took several years and billions of dollars (much more than Patco had demanded) to return the system to its pre-strike levels. [...]
By 2010, the number of workers participating in walkouts was less than 2 percent of what it had been when Reagan led the actors’ strike in 1952. Lacking the leverage that strikes once provided, unions have been unable to pressure employers to increase wages as productivity rises. Inequality has ballooned to a level not seen since Reagan’s boyhood in the 1920s.

This event was and is rightfully considered a watershed moment in the Republican Party's attempts to destroy unions and the union movement.  Since Reagan took on PATCO, unions have seen their membership number decline precipitously, and most working class Americans have seen their wages and salaries stagnant, even as the individuals (CEO's, Senior executives, and people like Mitt Romney and his former firm Bain Capital) who control major corporations and industries have seen their pay and income soar to levels once though unimaginable.
What many may not know, however, is that Ronald Reagan in the last days of the 1980 election campaign, sent a letter to the President of PATCO, Robert E. Poli, promising he understood the many numerous concerns air traffic controller had with their pay, outmoded equipment and working conditions.  Specifically, he promised to provide them with the most up-to-date equipment and to work with them to provide more staffing and less brutal work schedules in the interest of public safety.  Here's a image of Reagan's letter to Pioli, dated October 20, 1980:

For those having difficulty reading the content of that letter from the image, here is a transcription of the text in full:
Dear Mr. Poli:
I have been briefed by members of my staff as to the deplorable state of our nation's air traffic control system.  They have told me that too few people working unreasonable hours with obsolete equipment has placed the nation's air travelers in unwarranted danger.  In an area so clearly related to public policy the Carter administration has failed to act responsibly.
You can rest assured that if I am elected president, I will take whatever steps are necessary to provide our air traffic controllers with the most modern equipment available and to adjust staff levels and work days so that they are commensurate with achieving a maximum degree of public safety.
As in all other areas of the federal government where the President has the power to appoint, I fully intend to appoint highly qualified individuals who can work harmoniously with Congress and the employees of the governmental agencies they oversee.
I pledge to you that my administration will work very closely with you to bring about a spirit of cooperation between the president and the air traffic controllers.  Such harmony can and must exist of we are to restore the people's confidence in their government.
Sincerely,
Ronald Reagan

Based in part on this this letter Poli and other senior PATCO officials had PATCO endorse Reagan for President.  PATCO was one of only four AFL-CIO affiliated unions to endorse Reagan over Carter.
[N]ewly elected PATCO president Robert Poli—who’d succeeded the more irenic incumbent John Leyden in a surprise insurgent challenge—was keen to demonstrate his clout before the union’s restive rank and file. He presumed to be bargaining from a position of strength because during the run-up to contract negotiations, PATCO had sought to secure firm Washington backing with another surprise move: it endorsed Reagan in the 1980 election, partly as a matter of heeding the shifting national mood, and partly out of sheer exasperation with the Carter administration’s handling of key controller concerns.
Never has a Union leader made a more serious mistake in judgment.  The Reagan appointed head of the FAA failed to negotiate in goof faith, reacting to PATCO's demand for pay raises, improved equipment and less arduous working hours with a counteroffer equal to approximately 1/7 of the cost of the union's offer.  Poli accepted the offer, but did so with little enthusiasm.  Reagan had doubled crossed him and put his position with PATCO's membership at risk. The administration's hard line only encouraged those at PATCO to strike, which was Reagan's goal all along.  
He immediately invoked the Taft-Hartley act and fired all the striking air controllers on August 5, 1981, a total exceeding 11,000.  Reagan then hired 5.500 scabs as the FAA head, Drew Lewis claimed that there had been a ""surplus of controllers.""  The FAA also reduced flights by 25% and also brought in 370 military controllers.  Though the FAA promised to have staffing levels up to pre-1981 levels within two years, in fact it took almost a decade before those levels were again achieved.  This was due partly to Reagan's ban on rehiring any of the fired PATCO controllers.  
Reagan never had any intention of working with the union.  This can be best demonstrated by the fact that in February, the Reagan Department of Justice, aided by the FAA, had complied a list of air traffic controllers to arrested and prosecuted in the event of a strike.  One Federal District Judge in Denver threw out all the criminal indictments against local PATCO officials, labeling the Reagan DOJ's actions as creating a ""hit list"" at a time when the government was supposed to be negotiating with the union in ""good faith.""
Today, of course, the Republican candidates feel free to openly demonize unions and seek to destroy the right to collectively bargain.  We've seen the actions of Republican governors elected in 2010 as proof of that.  The nation's political landscape is vastly changed by what Reagan accomplished in his showdown with PATCO.  Reagan gambled that he could get away with his lies back then, and he succeeded.  Now Republicans can lie on a daily basis and no one in the media even bothers to check the claims they make, the numerous falsehoods and prevarications they promulgate.  Now the unions are shrinking, and they more often than not refuse to strike our of fear.  Now Democrats govern as 1990's era Republicans, catering far to often to the wealthy elites and multinational corporations and failing to support unions.
And it all started with Ronnie Reagan's sweet little lie to the air traffic controllers.  He wasn't concerned about the safety of air travel.  He wasn't willing to work with PATCO to improve working conditions or modernize our air traffic control system.  He wanted an easy target to make the case that unions are bad for America, and he hoodwinked PATCO into believing he would act honorably and treat them fairly.  He lied, and we have been paying the price for it ever since.

NBC/WSJ Pollster Peter Hart on @nbcnightlynews re: shutdown #'s: ""These were jaw-dropping numbers. You see this once or twice in a lifetime""
— @AdamVerdugo





Sure, GOP is getting more blame, but not as much as they did in 1995.
By a 22-point margin (53 percent to 31 percent), the public blames the Republican Party more for the shutdown than President Barack Obama – a wider margin of blame for the GOP than the party received during the poll during the last shutdown in 1995-96.
It was true that blame was more evenly distributed at the beginning of the crisis, but this poll marks the second showing a precipitous drop in GOP support (Gallup was the first). People may have spent the first few days of the crisis taking stock of the situation, but they're now coming off the sidelines.
By opposing an unpopular law, Republicans will rally the public behind them
Just 24 percent of respondents have a favorable opinion about the GOP, and only 21 percent have a favorable view of the Tea Party, which are both at all-time lows in the history of poll.
No one could've predicted that being unmitigated assholes would backfire. Actually, everyone did outside of their rightwing bubble. Indeed, the trendlines of the polling aggregates are unmistakable:

And damn, I wish the elections were this November:
[O]ne year until next fall’s midterm elections, American voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress to a Republican-controlled one by eight percentage points (47 percent to 39 percent), up from the Democrats’ three-point advantage last month (46 percent to 43 percent).
Remember, Democrats need to win the generic congressional ballot by about seven points to take back the House. GOP Rep. Phil Gingrey may get his wish after all.
Republicans might suffer, but so will Obama and Democrats as voters and the media put a pox on both houses.
Obama’s political standing has remained relatively stable since the shutdown, with his approval rating ticking up two points since last month, and with the Democratic Party’s favorability rating declining just three points (from 42 percent to 39 percent).
So much for the ""both houses"" theory. If only someone had suggested the past five years that standing firm against Republican intransigence wouldn't just be good policy, but good politics. I mean, someone inside the White House and congressional leadership offices. Because outside of the Beltway, the roar was deafening. Feels good to be proven right. Too bad it had to happen this way.
Republicans can do anything they want since the public doesn't like Obamacare
[T]he health-care law has become more popular since the shutdown began. Thirty-eight percent see the Affordable Care Act (or “Obamacare”) as a good idea, versus 43 percent who see it as a bad idea – up from 31 percent good idea, 44 percent bad idea last month.
The Republican intransigence appears to be the best thing that ever happened to the law. You know how Republicans oppose anything that President Barack Obama does? Well, Republicans are now so hated, that the public seems to be rallying around the things Republicans oppose. I've gotta admit, I didn't see that one coming.
The American people want Republicans to fight for smaller government
And by a 52-percent-to-44 percent difference, respondents believe the government should do more to solve problems. Back in June, the public was split, 48 percent to 48 percent, on whether the government should do more or less.
Republicans have somehow managed to make government more popular. Without the shutdown, they might've focused on Obamacare implementation problems and the absurd cost of the Canadian-built non-working federal exchanges website. That shit pisses even me off. But nope. By acting like total dicks, Republicans have reminded the public about the benefits of having a functional government.

So just how disastrous has this shutdown been for Republicans? They've rebranded in the wrong direction, hitting their all-time highs in unpopularity and bringing down the Tea Party (21/47), John Boehner (17/42) and Ted Cruz (14/28) down in the process. Fitting, since those are the masterminds of this genius plan which wasn't just doomed to obvious failure, but has made both Obamacare and the government more popular.
Epic.

Quick and dirty.  On twitter, Greg Sargent linked to a Jennifer Rubin piece that shockingly appears to be well-researched and detailed, and strongly suggests Rand Paul repeatedly violated physician advertising laws in Kentucky by holding himself out as board certified.
We probably know the story that Rand Paul made up his own ophthalmology board (the National Opthalmology Board, which despite its name, was mainly a Kentucky thing) in 1997.  I just thought that it just sounded like bullshit and left it at that, but it turns out the board was defunct in 2000, revived in 2005, and defunct again in 2011.  During the time it was out of business, no board was certifying Dr. Paul, and after 2005, it was not recognized as a licensing board by the state of Kentucky.
Now, one does not need board certification to practice medicine or to obtain admitting privileges, but it is a factor in physician advertising rules for consumer protection purposes.  If there is no board to enforce compliance or regulate continuing education, then board certification is utterly meaningless, so the board has to, first of all, exist, and second of all, perform some function other than advance the interest of younger ophthalmologists upset that older ones could be grandfathered into certification rules.
This is likely because you can't just have doctors making up their own licensing boards and call themselves board certified!  Of course, this is what Dr. Paul would call ""big government,"" because what does freedom mean if quacks can't cut open your eyeballs.  
Paul may not be a quack, but by holding himself out as board certified despite not being that in reality, he in effect holds himself out as a quack.
So, it sounds like Paul's ethical problems may not stop with plagiarism. And ask yourself - what would a real medical board do with the plagiarism story, anyway?
Of course, take anything Jennifer Rubin says with an ocean of salt, but I think at the very least, Paul has some questions to account for (and Rubin reports his staff in no way did).  And in the meantime, bask in the delicious joy that is R-on-R violence.

  In an unexpected segment on NBC Nightly News, Brian Williams turned to Chuck (It's Not My Job) Todd to report on the driving force behind the government shutdown: a group of about 80 Republicans in the House from very conservative districts. Video doesn't seem to be available yet, but a tweet from Todd gives a hint: Tune in on @nbcnightlynews for a look at the conservative engine inside the House GOP  At the moment the comments seem to show a leaning towards blue sentiments, with a few red stater types weighing in, plus some who are too disgusted to even think about it.
       The quick version as best I can recall, is, roughly 80 House Republicans were tagged as using the budget as a hammer to force concessions on Obabmacare, in a letter they signed back in August sent to the House leadership. A look at them shows they come from districts where they won by large majorities and President Obama lost by a big margin. In other words, they expect to feel no political heat back home for shutting down the government.
        Two of them (whose names escape me) were interviewed briefly. My impression is that they were both quite pleased with having shut down the government, because they believe Obamacare is just too ""onerous"". They were elected in 2010, after the bill creating the ACA passed into law; they didn't get to vote on it so they're taking it upon themselves to stop it any way they can.
    Charles P. Pierce has their number right here:
In the year of our Lord 2010, the voters of the United States elected the worst Congress in the history of the Republic. There have been Congresses more dilatory. There have been Congresses more irresponsible, though not many of them. There have been lazier Congresses, more vicious Congresses, and Congresses less capable of seeing forests for trees. But there has never been in a single Congress -- or, more precisely, in a single House of the Congress -- a more lethal combination of political ambition, political stupidity, and political vainglory than exists in this one, which has arranged to shut down the federal government because it disapproves of a law passed by a previous Congress, signed by the president, and upheld by the Supreme Court, a law that does nothing more than extend the possibility of health insurance to the millions of Americans who do not presently have it, a law based on a proposal from a conservative think-tank and taken out on the test track in Massachusetts by a Republican governor who also happens to have been the party's 2012 nominee for president of the United States. That is why the government of the United States is, in large measure, closed this morning.
        While Todd's report doesn't get as colorful as that of Pierce, it does make very clear that the government of the United States has been shut down at the behest of a minority of the House Republican Party, representing a fraction of the United States and and even smaller fraction of the voting public.
       This may be as close as we get to seeing a major news outlet lay this on a bunch of GOP ideologues. It will be interesting to see if anyone else picks up on this, or it sinks back into the ""one hand - other hand"" school of reporting.
   If NBC puts the video clip up, I'll try to link to it.
     Meanwhile, the next report up was about how the first day of the Healthcare Exchanges opening up was marked by huge numbers of people crashing websites as they tried to find out more and sign up for insurance...
UPDATE: HERE'S THE VIDEO (thanks to Phil S 33 for finding it) It's a remarkable report from a mainstream news organizations that for once doesn't waffle about what's really behind the government shutdown. This is one to Facebook and share as widely as possible.
http://www.nbcnews.com/...






Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy
UPDATE 2: Tip to Jacoby Jonze, who links to this Ryan Lizza New Yorker article that is the apparent source for Todd's report. Names, map, and a lot more detail. Lizza calls the GOP extremists ""The Suicide Caucus""; let's hope this doesn't turn into one of those murder-suicide stories. These people, it should be said, are determined to deny millions of their fellow Americans access to health care, and they don't care what the body count will be.
UPDATE 3: While there are some complaints that Todd didn't push his two interview subjects hard enough on their stand or otherwise explain what's happening in as great detail as might be desired, the issue is now out there and the rest of the media just might start to run with it. Example - NY Times
UPDATE 4:  When even Thomas Friedman gets it, you know you're in trouble.

Without the shutdown, they might've focused on Obamacare implementation problems and the absurd cost of the Canadian-built non-working federal exchanges website. That shit pisses even me off. But nope. By acting like total dicks, Republicans have reminded the public about the benefits of having a functional government.

So just how disastrous has this shutdown been for Republicans? They've rebranded in the wrong direction, hitting their all-time highs in unpopularity and bringing down the Tea Party (21/47), John Boehner (17/42) and Ted Cruz (14/28) down in the process. Fitting, since those are the masterminds of this genius plan which wasn't just doomed to obvious failure, but has made both Obamacare and the government more popular.
Epic.

Who’s afraid of Congresswoman Michele Bachmann? The entire range of far-left activists, apparently.
Bachmann (R-MN) is currently the target of an aggressive campaign sponsored by a leftist organization, People for the American Way. Its immediate objective is to get House Speaker John Boehner to strip her of her Intelligence Committee seat.
According to the Watchdog Wire, the group–affiliated with ACORN, George Soros, and United for Peace and Justice–has taken a rather vocal stance against Bachmann.
People for the American Way (PFAW) has launched a new campaign against Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN), who, after her recent re-election to Congress, has been re-appointed to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).
A PFAW-sponsored petition with 178,000 signatures is to be presented to House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) on Monday 21 January 2012 to protest Bachmann’s HPSCI appointment.
Citing what PFAW calls “ugly Islamophobic fear mongering,” the petition decries what it alleges are Bachmann’s “unfounded and irresponsible attacks on dedicated public servants.”
Michele Bachmann has represented the people of Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District since 2007. She is the Chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus in the House of Representatives.
Bachmann’s supporters consider her a staunch conservative who is a champion of the cause of limited, constitutional government. They admire her for her commitment to low taxes and fiscal discipline, as well as her opposition to socialized medicine.
In matters of national defense, Bachmann is a stalwart advocate of Ronald Reagan’s philosophy of Peace through Strength. Rep. Bachmann has spoken many times regarding the threat of radical Islam and Obama administration policies that are exacerbating it.
The petition was not PFAW’s first assault on Bachmann, as the group spent most of 2012 producing propaganda to make people distance themselves from the Congresswoman and her startling revelations.
Bachmann is credited with leading a 2012 effort to launch official investigations into the activities of federal employees in five executive branch agencies allegedly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood.
From FrontPage Magazine:
Last June, Rep. Michele Bachmann and four Republican colleagues sent letters to the Inspectors General at the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State, asking them to investigate whether the Muslim Brotherhood–the ideological wellspring from which such terrorist outfits as al Qaeda and Hamas first emerged–might be gaining undue influence over high-level U.S. government officials. One letter, for instance, noted that Hillary Clinton’s closest aide, her deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin, “has three family members… connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.”
Critics viciously attacked Bachmann for asking these questions. Many on the right consider her treatment unwarranted, ad hominem criticism from left-leaning establishment media and Islamist organizations–and even from some fellow Republicans–and that it decreased the margin of her very narrow reelection in 2012.
Why the special interest from PFAW? According to Discover the Networks:
People for the American Way (PFAW) was established in 1981 as a Tides Foundation project designed to counteract the allegedly growing influence of what its founder, television producer and political activist Norman Lear, denounced as the ‘religious right.’ 
In July 2011, PFAW published a Right Wing Playbook on Anti-Muslim Extremism, whose theme is that: “Under the guise of defending freedom and American values, right-wing anti-Muslim activists are campaigning to prevent Muslim-Americans from freely worshiping and practicing their religion, curtail their political rights, and even compel their deportation.”
Bachmann is also despised on the left because of her role in taking down ACORN. Bachmann went after ACORN for its role in the federal census before the group received national media attention, and the far left has never forgotten it. ACORN received over $100,000 from the foundation started by the wife of PFAW founder Norman Lear. PFAW also shares other funders with ACORN and has worked with Project Vote for years on “election protection.” PFAW boasts celebrity board members like Alec Baldwin and Seth McFarlane. The board also consists of several members with connections to the Communist Party of the USA and the usual suspects of radical millionaires.
Would PFAW’s interest have anything to do with Deborah Rappaport and her husband Andrew?
Discover the Networks provides a very clear profile:
A committed Democrat and a socialist, Rappaport has established himself (along with his wife, the philanthropist and political activist Deborah Rappaport) as one of the largest donors to Democratic Party candidates and causes. Between 1999 and 2008, he contributed $340,139 to candidates and political action committees at the national level. In addition, he and his wife have given millions of dollars to organizations that promote Democrat objectives and policies…  
Andrew Rappaport is secretary of the Rappaport Family Foundation (RFF), which he and his wife established in 2002 as a vehicle by which to administer their charitable donations. Between 2004 and 2008, RFF gave $850,000 to People for the American Way, $700,000 to the Center for American Progress, and $323,000 to the anti-war group Project Billboard. In 2006 RFF sent $100,000 to the Tides Center, which in turn (on instructions from RFF) funneled the money to Allied Media Projects, an anti-corporate community-media organization where ACORN founder Wade Rathke sits on the board of directors. As of 2006, RFF’s assets totaled $7.6 million.
Other ACORN connected board members of PFAW include the well-connected radical Margery Tabankin, the Executive Director of both Steven Spielberg’s Righteous Persons Foundation and The Streisand Foundation.
Bachmann’s enemies at PFAW even originate from her own backyard. Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie is not only connected to several of the PFAW board members’ radical organizations but he is also a friend of Bachmann’s old foe ACORN.
How close of a friend? While at ACORN, I remember several efforts working with local Democrats to raise money for the Franken versus Coleman efforts. This included a 2008 meeting between Secretary of State Ritchie, ACORN, Project Vote. The subject of the meeting? Ritchie was actively providing fundraising help for Project Vote and ACORN.
PFAW has a long history of partisan political activity that is ignored by the very same mainstream media that have funded–yes, funded them in the past. CBS, NBC, ABC and even the New York Times have failed to note what the Capital Research Center (CRC) pointed out in 2002. During the height of PFAW’s work to stymie all Bush judicial nominees, CRC wrote:
People for the American Way and its affiliates work together as a powerful lobby for leftist ideology and Democratic party politics. Whatever its tax lawyers may say, the scandal of PFAW is that foundations and corporations inflate its budget and pay for its politics. Every dollar contributed to PFAW advances a profoundly political agenda.
To recap, PFAW’s board is comprised of a who’s who of far-left radicals, socialists, and communists. They are tied to ACORN and Project Vote, and the bulk of their funding comes from far-left foundations like Tides. In addition, the Capital Research Center reported that in 2003 and 2004, 98 percent of the organization’s political contributions went to left-wing Democratic candidates.
Do PFAW and its allies aim to inflict further damage in the Alinsky style to one of our country’s most courageous and visionary leaders, to defeat her next year as part of the left’s determined bid to return the House to Democratic control? 
Speaker of the House John Boehner and the rest of the country should stand strong behind Michele Bachmann. With those kind of enemies, Bachmann appears to be one of the few in Congress on the right path. We must not allow the Islamists and their allies on the left to deprive our country at this critical moment of Michele Bachmann’s leadership on national security, limited government, and conservative values at a moment when they are needed more than ever. If one woman can bring the entire wrath of the left down on her, one must examine her statements and remember the old adage “the truth hurts.” Well, look who’s howling now."

Concerned citizens lined the gallery of the State Capitol to watch the debate unfold for the Republicans' ultrasound probe law which will require unnecessary and invasive medical treatments on any women seeking an abortion. The bill had already passed through the State Senate, with the dramatic and demonstrably uncivil silencing of any minority party debate, as chronicled by Giles Goat Boy. The lack of collegiality demonstrated by Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis is nothing short of  breathtaking, even for those of us a bit short of breath from two years of constant struggle against this radical governance franchise that has overtaken the state. Witnesses in the gallery testify that he actually broke his gavel from his aggressive pummeling of procedural protocol. That was on Wednesday.


One day later, yesterday, and only two weeks since the Republicans introduced it, the bill passed the House on a 56 to 39 vote. During what passed for debate, the citizens in the gallery sat silent, some with duct tape over their mouths. The gallery was lined with Capitol Police, whose job it is to oversee the increasingly detailed and labyrinthine sets of rules of conduct and laws restricting assembly that have been put in place during the last two years. It has been clear that signage is no longer allowed in the gallery, nor is photography, nor recording devices of any kinds. I don't know that we were cognizant that silence would not be allowed. That's right: in Wisconsin, our silence has been silenced!
According to the twitter stream of Madison writer and activist Rebecca Kemble's eyewitness account:
       
Women with tape over their mouths silently protesting #gynogovt in Assembly Gallery told to take it off. Some of them ejected. #WarOnWomen
 

Clapping spontaneously erupted after Democratic Representative Sandy Pasch spoke of the importance of access to birth control for women:
Rep. Pasch on AB 216: ""The author of this bill is seriously out of touch with the reality of women."" #gynogovt #WarOnWomen
Applause from the gallery causes Speaker Pro Tem Kramer to have people removed without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomen
 
Dems protesting Kramer's ejection of the public from the gallery without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomen
One woman was handcuffed and marched out due to her unwillingness to leave the gallery when Rep. Kramer cleared the first two rows due to clapping.

Women in the gallery who removed tape from their mouths on the order of Speaker Pro Tem Kramer now holding hands over mouths. #gynogovt

       
I'll end with that chilling image. A radical bill of serious consequence was fast-tracked through legislature and now waits to be signed by Governor Walker. He's already said that he has no problem with ultrasounds, and will readily sign. The Senate allowed no debate, insisting on a rapid and violent roll-call vote. The House allowed the performance of debate and voted along party lines. The citizens watching from the galleries above were surrounded by police. There were no outbursts, no incivility, only one instance of clapping. The first two rows were immediately ejected, without warning, by the order of the Republican Speaker.
Women sitting silently with duct tape on their mouths were given the ultimatum: take off your tape, or face arrest. They took off their tape, and sat silently with their hands over their mouths. No talking allowed. No clapping allowed. No noise allowed. No silence allowed.

Here you go:

NYDN
Detroit Free Press
ABC


UPDATE II:  Here's the actual complaint filed in United States District Court (he's sicker than I thought).  Looks like he texted to the victim that he could reach her Mom's Facebook account, and that he was masturbating to the photos of the victim.  AND contacted the boyfriend of at least one of the victims.

UPDATE:  It gets worse.  Looks like pictures weren't the only things he was after.  I think, given enough time, he would have demanded actual sex.

From SLATE:
In one case he allegedly goaded a subject with ""a series of personal questions, relating to sexual preferences, positions, etc,"" holding out the nude photos as bait.

What do Newt Gingrich, Paul Ryan, and Mitt Romney have in common?
They have in common, one Adam Savader.
Who is Adam Savader, you ask?  Well, he's the very latest, fresh off the indictment list, of ""family values"" Republicanism.  
Adam Savader has worked for all three human-wannabes listed in my title.  And, he was arrested today (let's just say that he has a little thing for the girl-nextdoor).
On Twitter, Savader describes himself as ""Formerly @PRyan's sole intern on @MittRomney's campaign and a @newtgingrich campaign staffer."" His Twitter avatar is a picture of him with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).


Adam Savader, 21, who is also a former intern of Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign, contacted 15 victims between May 2012 and February 2013, according to affidavit by FBI Special Agent Michael T. Garland. Savader would allegedly contact his victims via text message from a Google Voice number, telling them he had nude pictures and threatening to send them to their parents or post them online unless they sent him more.
Many of the victims, some of which have not been identified, either went to the same college as Savader or grew up in the same area as Savader, who is from Great Neck, New York.



Assuming they got the right guy, Adam can now join a very long list of GOP up-and-cummers (sorry) who have cut short their careers with dank proclivities of a sexual nature.
Several of the victims reported that their Gmail accounts had been compromised prior to receiving the threatening messages.
In another example, Victim 4 received the following text message from a Google Voice number on Oct. 30, 2012: ""WAIT! Listen to me. If we don't have a deal I will send the pictures to those people. Is that what u want? remember what's at stake. do u want ur family and everyone in DC to see ur tits? Just agree to e-mail me a pic of u in a bra.""



One TPM commenter named AlphaDad hit the nailio on the headio with this tart retort:
The thing that makes this really perverse is that he could get nude pictures galore, legally, for free, anytime he wanted to on the internet. What turned his crank was extorting the photos from these young women. He took pleasure in their fear and shame, in his ability to intimidate and manipulate them. It wasn't about the photos. This is one sick bastard.

After weeks of being vilified by the national media and White House as a terrorist, racist, and radical hostage-taker out to destroy the economy, Ted Cruz (R-TX) is receiving the kind of death threats that are all-too expected after this kind of national demonization campaign. A person who identifies himself on Twitter as Troy Gilmore, Jr. listed the Senator’s homes address and suggested Cruz be taught a “street wise lesson.” Capitol Police are investigating:
 The Hill reported Capitol Police were looking into the post by someone identifying himself as Troy  Gilmore Jr.
 The tweet, posted early Friday, said, “Take down Ted Cruz, at his home” and listed Cruz’s home  address in Houston, The Hill reported.
 It also said, “What goes around comes around CRUZ!!”
 The Hill said the poster — using the Twitter handle @ArmyVet54 — said he had served in the U.S.  Army and Navy, and posted another tweet Friday afternoon saying Cruz “needs tobe [sic] taught a  street wise [sic] lesson.”
In the last couple of weeks, the hate speech directed at Cruz from the elite media has been merciless. Politico mused about drowning Cruz; The Washington Post compared Cruz to an evil, mass-murdering terrorist – “Ted Bin Laden”; a writer for The New Yorker compared Cruz to O.J. Simpson. The media have also made Cruz the face of a movement they have described as a bunch of racists “wearing suicide vests” and “taking hostages.” 
Mind you, this is just what the elite media have been saying. President Obama and top Democrats have been just as bad. 
After all of this, the only surprise is that this is the only death threat against Cruz, or at least the only one we know of. Why would someone not feel a seething hostility towards an individual the national media and our president are wishing dead, comparing to terrorists, and relentlessly demonizing as the leader of a radical, dangerous, arsonist, anarchist, racist, hostage-taking cause that will destroy America?
We sure have come a long way from a media and White House that just two years ago made a national crusade out of finding a New Tone in politics. In the wake of the horrific shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, within an hour, the media blamed Governor Sarah Palin over a standard issue campaign map that placed crosshairs over Giffords’ district. Even after it was clear there was no connection to the map and the deranged killer, the media and President Obama still lectured America over the corrosive effect violent political rhetoric was having on our culture. 
But just two years later, the media are no longer interested in enforcing the New Tone. And just a year after trying to destroy Rush Limbaugh over his labeling of a left-wing activist as a “slut,” the media are currently engaged in a hate speech campaign beyond anything we have seen in years.  
Politics aside, although the media will never publicly acknowledge the possibility that their “othering campaign” might have contributed to a death threat against a U.S. Senator serious enough to involve police, let’s hope that privately there is at least some soul searching going on.

The bipartisan Senate group pushing immigration reform, dubbed the “Gang of Eight,” has allowed a representative from President Barack Obama’s White House to be involved in writing their bill but has not even tried to meet with representatives from the law enforcement community, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.
“While Obama has allowed Senate negotiators to work on a compromise that can win approval, a White House staff member attends each staff-level meeting to monitor progress and assist with the technical aspects of writing the bill,” the Washington Post‘s Scott Wilson and Zachary Goldfarb reported on Sunday.
Even though the Gang of Eight–Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Jeff Flake, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, and Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, Michael Bennet and Bob Menendez–has allowed the White House into meetings, ICE officers union president Chris Crane notes that his group has been kept completely out of the discussion on immigration reform.
“We have tried for weeks, unsuccessfully, to get a meeting with the Gang of 8 in order to share our deep concerns about the breakdown of interior enforcement in America,” Crane said in the statement released on Sunday.  
“ICE’s political leadership, specifically Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton, have repeatedly and dangerously undermined the ability of ICE officers and agents to do their jobs and ensure the constitutionally established rule of law is upheld. Yet, while the Gang of 8 has, as reported for months, worked extensively with powerful interest groups, ICE officers–like the public–have been shut out. Now we understand from media reports that the Gang of 8 is preparing to drop a 1,500 page bill on Tuesday, and pass it as quickly as possible, without having received any input from rank-and-file ICE officers.
“If the Gang is truly committed to enforcement and public safety they should be eager to provide our officers with an opportunity to review this legislation and offer detailed input before it is introduced,” Crane added. “I would therefore respectfully request that the introduction of the bill be delayed so that ICE officers and others in the law enforcement community can be fully briefed on this 1,500 page bill and offer detailed input regarding some of our nation’s most urgent interior enforcement needs that this proposal seemingly does nothing to address.”
Even though the Gang of Eight has refused meeting requests with ICE officers to discuss real law enforcement reform in the immigration debate, Rubio–the GOP members’ de facto leader–says he wants an open and transparent discussion on this issue. He has still not forced multiple hearings on the legislation, as he previously promised, and has not set up a meeting with ICE officers.
During his Sunday show charm offensive, Rubio continued saying he supports an open and transparent debate."

See no legislation, hear no legislation, pass no legislation



See no legislation, hear no legislation, pass no legislation

House Republicans are in disarray:
The GOP leadership is dealing with an unprecedented level of frustration in running the House, according to conversations with more than a dozen aides and lawmakers in and around leadership. Leadership is talking past each other. The conference is split by warring factions. And influential outside groups are fighting them.
The chaos has led to a sense of stalemate for House Republicans, who have been in the majority since 2011.

""Stalemate"" is the nice way of saying that House Republicans couldn't pass a bill to dial 911 if John Boehner were on fire. At long last, their remarkable ability to get absolutely nothing of substance done has dawned upon even them.
Speaker John Boehner, Cantor and McCarthy are plagued by a conference split into two groups. In one camp are stiff ideologues who didn’t extract any lesson from Mitt Romney’s loss and are only looking to slash spending and defund President Barack Obama’s health care law at every turn. In the other are lawmakers who are aligned with Cantor, who is almost singularly driving an agenda which is zeroed in on family issues.
So it's between the serial arsonists and the the more pragmatic guys who are desperately trying to find their next ""flag burning!"" or other super-important social issue that nobody ever thought was a problem until suddenly all of western civilization hinged on defeating it right this minute. Oh wait, they already have one: Morals-obsessed Taco Bell owners having to provide slightly better health insurance for their slutty, slutty employees.
As for the hapless Boehner (below the fold):


Boehner seems more focused on passing big pieces of legislation like hiking the debt ceiling and extending government funding, sometimes drawing flak for having to rely on Democrats to move these bills over the finish line.
I'm imagining Boehner standing in an empty hallway here. ""Guys? The government is kinda collapsing here. I don't mean to alarm anyone, but if we don't pass a reasonable budget by the end of the month the folks at the National Zoo say they're going to have to let all their animals go, and they're threatening to personally drive them to my office before releasing them.""
""Screw you, let the government fall!"" yell the anarchists from one room. ""No deal, but you can have your FAA controllers back,"" shout the pragmatists from another, ""but in exchange we're passing a bill next month banning the use of human fetal tissue as lawnmower lubricant. And you're standing up giving a press conference telling America that's a thing now.""
And scene. The buffoonery would be great fun to watch, if it weren't for that whole screwing-Americans-over-on-a-weekly-basis thing. Tell you what, guys, let's get the government running again and then you can have your little power war afterwards. We all promise we'll still pay attention to you.
No luck, though. The House GOP is so hamstrung that they've devolved into legislative thumb-twiddling:
The inability to find unifying principles is sometimes in plain view: House Republicans spent two days last week passing legislation that extended the authority of the government’s helium reserves, which Democrats would’ve allowed them to pass by unanimous voice vote.
Given the number of off days they've given themselves, I suppose we should be happy they still show up for work at all.

We're seeing the hypocrisy daily:  
The TX GOP Congressman berating a Federal Park ranger for the closure of a WWII memorial to visiting WWII veterans - a closure necessitated by his vote and those of his fellow Tea Baggers
The standing ovation in Congress for the Capitol Police force in the wake of their actions yesterday when a motorist tried to ram her way through a security barricade, even as that same Congress with its shutdown, results in those security personnel continuing to work but getting no paychecks.
Bureau of Labor Statistics....no jobs report.  Major portions of our nation's food industry essentially uninspected for food health and safety, National Guard troops unable to help Colorado communities recover from massive flooding and road closures as winter approaches.
But that didn't deter Fox News Business host Stuart Varney from letting everyone know his views about federal workers.
The details below the graphic picture of Varney's entrails:


Via Media Matters:
On the October 2 edition of AM 560's The Big John & Amy Show, co-hosts John Howell and Amy Jacobson interviewed Fox Business' Stuart Varney and asked him about the government shutdown and its effect on workers and the economy. Varney stated, incorrectly, that the shutdown was not having an impact on financial markets or the greater economy before launching into a tirade against federal employees.
HOWELL: Do you think that federal workers, when this ends, are deserving of their back pay or not?
VARNEY: That is a loaded question isn't it? You want my opinion? This is President Obama's shutdown. He is responsible for shutting this thing down; he's taken an entirely political decision here. No, I don't think they should get their back pay, frankly, I really don't. I'm sick and tired of a massive, bloated federal bureaucracy living on our backs, and taking money out of us, a lot more money than most of us earn in the private sector, then getting a furlough, and then getting their money back at the end of it. Sorry, I'm not for that. I want to punish these people. Sorry to say that, but that's what I want to do.
JACOBSON: But it's not their fault. It's not the federal employees' fault. I mean, that's what I'm sick of, I hate and it makes me anxious, to see people who are victimized because of a political fight.
VARNEY: I take your point Amy, it is not directly their fault, but I'm looking at the big picture here. I'm getting screwed. Here I am, a private citizen, paying an inordinate amount of money in tax. I've got a slow economy because it's all government, all the time. And these people are living on our backs, regulating us, telling us what to do, taxing us, taking our money, and living large. This is my chance to say ""hey, I'm fed up with this and I don't miss you when you're on furlough."" Sorry if that's a harsh tone, but that's the way I feel.

I am frankly at a loss for words.  Not since Rick Santelli launched his famous diatribe at the government bailout program on CNBC has a right-wing nutjob been so publicly and completely clueless, insensitive and ignorant as Mr. Varney.
Born in England in 1949, he came to the US in 1974.  He has worked for Fox, CNN and CNBC and lives in Franklin Lakes, NJ which, according to Wikipedia, has the 18th highest income of the state's  566 municipalities and 146th in Forbes listing of ""America's Most Expensive ZIP Codes"", with a median home price of $1,306,546
I am sure we can all understand the incredible pain and suffering Mr. Varney has had to endure living in these kinds of conditions and how much better off he would be if all federal and state workers simply quit their jobs to make his life happier.
There must be a special place in the Callousness Hall of Fame for Mr. Varney.  Perhaps Kossacks can suggest some fitting consequences for his brutal and totally uninformed diatribe.

Pssst. Michele. You might want to pay your staff before they spill even more of your dirty little secrets.

Today in why you shouldn't treat your staff badly, then refuse to pay them when they refuse to retroactively agree to aid and abet your potentially criminal activities, we have this juicy little nugget from Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed:
Michelle [sic] Bachmann's high-profile debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, developed an ""unnatural"" and ""Rasputin-like"" relationship with his candidate during her failed 2012 presidential campaign, another former aide told BuzzFeed, a charge O'Donnell denies.
The former aide who's keeping us entertained with the trash-talking is Peter Waldron—the same Peter Waldron who's had an awful lot to say lately about his former employer:
Peter Waldron, her controversial former national field coordinator, told Salon the dispute started when former Iowa straw poll staffers refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement that would bar them from discussing any “unethical, immoral, or criminal activity” they witnessed on the campaign with police or reporters. [...]
Waldron said the staffers are owed a mere $5,000, and that Bachmann has more than $2 million in her campaign account, but has refused to pay unless the staffers sign the agreement.

Of course, that whole refusing-to-pay-staff thing was last week's news. This week, Waldron is regaling us with tales of how easily Bachmann was apparently brainwashed by her debate coach who, Waldron says, had an ""unusual power over Mrs. Bachmann."" How powerful was he? This powerful:
""He prohibited her husband, Dr. Marcus Bachmann, from sleeping in the same room with wife while on the campaign trail,"" Waldron said in an email to BuzzFeed.
Marcus was no doubt heartbroken about that.
Too bad Michele Bachmann is so busy still trying to repeal Obamacare instead of keeping her former campaign staffers happy. Probably a bad idea to screw them over when they're obviously sitting on a goldmine of gossip—and potentially criminal activities—about the queen of batshit crazy.
Tell the FEC to investigate the alleged crimes of Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign.

Yes, the Republican proposal for $40 billion in food stamp cuts over the next 10 years would have horrific effects on millions of people, the dirty hippies over at the Congressional Budget Office confirm:
According to the CBO, 1.7 million people would be forced off the rolls in the coming year if the state waivers are repealed as proposed by Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Another 2.1 million would be dropped in 2014 as a result of the tighter eligibility rules backed by the GOP.
In both cases, the impact would decline as the economy improves and more jobs become available. But on average, CBO estimates that a total of 2.8 million people would lose their benefits over the next decade, and another 850,000 households will see an average reduction of about $90 a month in benefits.

That's 1.7 million people going hungry or being forced onto severely restricted diets now, with millions more to come. A $90 cut in the groceries a family can buy in a month is also a Big F'ing Deal, especially for a family that's already pinching every penny to get enough to eat. Taking $90 out of a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program allotment that already only lasts most families two and a half weeks is in itself cruel—and, from the most coldly financial perspective, shortsighted, since forcing people to eat more cheaply means increased risk of diabetes and other chronic conditions that will raise health care costs for the nation.
But this is what Eric Cantor and the starvation caucus of his party want. And even if they can't actually get $40 billion in cuts through the Senate or signed by the president, the farm bill—which nutrition assistance is usually part of and which House Speaker John Boehner isn't sending to conference with the Senate until these cuts get a vote—sure makes a nice hostage to take in the effort to force deeper cuts than either the Senate or the president would want to make.
Wed Sep 18, 2013 at 11:44 AM PT (Chris Bowers): Please send an email to your member of the House of Representatives, telling him or her to oppose all cuts to food stamps.

UPDATE III:  Some here have asked for major-news outlet story links, for veracity, I guess.
Here you go:
CBS
WSJ
NYDN
Detroit Free Press
ABC


UPDATE II:  Here's the actual complaint filed in United States District Court (he's sicker than I thought).  Looks like he texted to the victim that he could reach her Mom's Facebook account, and that he was masturbating to the photos of the victim.  AND contacted the boyfriend of at least one of the victims.

UPDATE:  It gets worse.  Looks like pictures weren't the only things he was after.  I think, given enough time, he would have demanded actual sex.

From SLATE:
In one case he allegedly goaded a subject with ""a series of personal questions, relating to sexual preferences, positions, etc,"" holding out the nude photos as bait.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What do Newt Gingrich, Paul Ryan, and Mitt Romney have in common?
They have in common, one Adam Savader.
Who is Adam Savader, you ask?  Well, he's the very latest, fresh off the indictment list, of ""family values"" Republicanism.  
Adam Savader has worked for all three human-wannabes listed in my title.  And, he was arrested today (let's just say that he has a little thing for the girl-nextdoor).
On Twitter, Savader describes himself as ""Formerly @PRyan's sole intern on @MittRomney's campaign and a @newtgingrich campaign staffer."" His Twitter avatar is a picture of him with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).


Adam Savader, 21, who is also a former intern of Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign, contacted 15 victims between May 2012 and February 2013, according to affidavit by FBI Special Agent Michael T. Garland. Savader would allegedly contact his victims via text message from a Google Voice number, telling them he had nude pictures and threatening to send them to their parents or post them online unless they sent him more.
Many of the victims, some of which have not been identified, either went to the same college as Savader or grew up in the same area as Savader, who is from Great Neck, New York.



Assuming they got the right guy, Adam can now join a very long list of GOP up-and-cummers (sorry) who have cut short their careers with dank proclivities of a sexual nature.
Several of the victims reported that their Gmail accounts had been compromised prior to receiving the threatening messages.
In another example, Victim 4 received the following text message from a Google Voice number on Oct. 30, 2012: ""WAIT! Listen to me. If we don't have a deal I will send the pictures to those people. Is that what u want? remember what's at stake. do u want ur family and everyone in DC to see ur tits? Just agree to e-mail me a pic of u in a bra.""



One TPM commenter named AlphaDad hit the nailio on the headio with this tart retort:
The thing that makes this really perverse is that he could get nude pictures galore, legally, for free, anytime he wanted to on the internet. What turned his crank was extorting the photos from these young women. He took pleasure in their fear and shame, in his ability to intimidate and manipulate them. It wasn't about the photos. This is one sick bastard.

Paul Begala at The Daily Beast:
Barack Obama is a remarkably gifted politician. But his cardinal political error has been that at times he seems to lack the imagination to even conceptualize how truly nihilistic, irresponsible, partisan, and, yes, crazy his Republican opponents are. The last Democratic president saw the Republicans shut down the government, squander millions on partisan witch hunts—including taking 140 hours of sworn testimony investigating President Clinton’s Christmas-card list—and drag the country through an impeachment process. Despite that history—and despite that Obama may be dealing with Republicans who are even more ideological and self-destructive than in Clinton’s day—he still expressed a blind faith in their reasonableness. How quaint.
This faith in the reasonableness of others is quintessentially American. We are, after all, a nation born of the Enlightenment. John Locke, the intellectual godfather of the American Revolution, said, “Reason must be our last judge and guide in everything.” But John Locke was a 17th-century English philosopher, not a 21st-century Tea Party nihilist. Obama, sadly, is not dealing with Mr. Locke—nor with Mr. Spock—but rather with zealous partisans who would, it seems, gladly harm the country in order to hurt the president. Highly illogical, perhaps, but real.
Our president, however, is nothing if not smart. And so he has adapted. Instead of sitting with Boehner and Cantor and McConnell, seeking to appeal to the cool light of reason, which failed so miserably in previous budget showdowns, he is barnstorming the country, basking in the warm glow of popular approval. Whereas once he seemed to prefer the prophet Isaiah’s entreaty, “Come now, let us reason together,” now he seems to be channeling the prophet Ezekiel: “I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes.” Fortunately for our nation, the president seems to have hit upon a strategy that works.
Let's go below the fold for more analysis on the latest top news stories.



Rick Perlstein's must-read at The Nation:
So: the “sequester.” That too-clever-by-half notion, born of last year’s debt ceiling negotiations out of the White House’s presumption that, when faced with the horror of heedless, profligate, across-the-board budget cuts to all manner of popular government programs, the Republicans’ “fever would break”—remember that?—and the Loyal Opposition would somehow come to agree to a reasonable, “balanced” deficit reduction package. It all seemed so cut and dried in those palmy days, just a few months ago: who could possibly imagine a major American political party could possibly let such madness actually go into effect?
Um, me? I wonder how many folks within the White House, gaming out whether Republicans might not just call the bluff, bothered to consider the fact that an embrace of heedless, profligate, across-the-board budget cuts to all manner of popular government programs is a key component of hardcore conservative ideology. [...] Did anyone in the White House notice how many conservatives, including ones in positions of governmental power, after Mitt Romney’s recorded back-room admission that he couldn’t get elected because 47 percent of the electorate is addicted to suckling on the federal teat, responded that what he said was absolutely correct? [...] And what could the White House have predicted conservatives would say to those who point out that pulling the rug out from under huge chunks of federal spending will spur a recession? They could have predicted that many would say exactly what they have said: that since it’s excessive federal spending that causes recessions, what’s wrong with cutting excessive federal spending?
Bottom line: didn’t anyone whose job it is to think about such things consider that at least some powerful Republicans—not all, it is true—would relish sequestration as a marvelous thing, a historic opportunity, a gift from Obama to help further the cause they’d been proclaiming as sacred for generations: to shrink the federal government small enough so they could someday drown it in Grover Norquist’s proverbial bathtub? “Once these cuts take effect, thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off and tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids,” said Obama. Did he ever consider that to a lot of Republicans, that would sound like a wish list?

Haley Sweetland Edwards at The Washington Monthly looks at how rule-making can affect the president's major policies:
It may seem counterintuitive, but those big hunks of legislation, despite being technically the law of the land, filed away in the federal code, don’t mean anything yet. They are, in the words of one CFTC official, “nothing but words on paper” until they’re broken down into effective rules, implemented, and enforced by an agency. Rules are where the rubber of our legislation hits the road of real life. To put that another way, if a rule emerges from a regulatory agency weak or riddled with loopholes, or if it’s killed entirely—like the CFTC’s rule on position limits—it is, in effect, almost as if that part of the law had not passed to begin with.
As of now, there’s no guarantee that either Obamacare or Dodd-Frank will be made into rules that actually do what lawmakers intended. That’s partly because the rule-making process is a dangerous place for a law to go.

Patrick Murphy look at how DOMA affects military families:
Last December, U.S. Marine Corps. Captain Matthew Phelps got down on one knee and proposed to the person he loved most in the world. It was one of the happiest moments of his life. The fact that it occurred in the White House made it all that much sweeter. Pictures of the moment went viral, popping up all over Twitter and Facebook.
Amazingly, while most Americans can recognize how special that moment was, our government continues to deny its significance. That’s because Matthew is gay, and due to that fact alone, his soon-to-be husband, Ben Schock, will be denied hundreds of benefits that we routinely give to military families.

Jay Bookman looks at corporate profits and points out that...:
...conservatives continue to argue that the business climate under President Obama stifles profitability.
He then links to this chart:

In the chart, the share of the national economy, or GDP, going to workers’ paychecks is in blue. The share of the economy that is going to after-tax corporate profits is in red.
It's a chart that makes the conservative claim that big business needs more corporate welfare all that more illogical.

She nailed it from the extremism to the petty bullying that has infested our State Legislature since the Red Tide election of 2010.
After taking even more extremist anti-abortion legislation off the table as I diaried here, saying they were going to end the legislative session on a lighter note, Republicans in the State Assembly pulled out a brand new shiny Voter Suppression Bill and resurrected a bill to allow state-issued anti-abortion license plates.
They did this because they got into a snit about Assembly Democrats calling for a vote on an already approved bill to honor the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre which passed the State Senate unanimously.  Republicans in the Assembly refused to even consider that bill.  Why?  Nobody seems to know.  So, in retaliation, they brought out more extremist bills including a brand new one to further restrict voting in Wisconsin.  Yes, it's gotten that petty.


The most severe of the voter suppression measures Republicans passed in 2011, including the presentation of a state-issued ID, are on hold by the courts.  Left in place, however, are measures that restrict early voting and absentee ballots,  as well as a requirement that all voters must sign the poll book.  These measures increase the amount voters who must vote in person as well as increase the actual amount of time poll workers need to spend with each voter.  Of course, this increases the lines of people who vote, further discouraging those with busy schedules or in crowded voting precincts.  And that's the intent of those laws - to suppress the vote in Democratic areas.
That wasn't enough for Republicans, though.  Their brand new shiny voter suppression bill removes ALL weekend voting (their limitation to 1 weekend from 3 in 2011 wasn't restrictive enough to prevent electoral wins by Tammy Baldwin and Barack Obama in 2012) and restricts early voting to ONE WEEK and ONLY during the hours of 7:30 AM - 5 PM (that'll show those folks who try to vote before or after work).
Not only that, but anyone without that ID needs to sign an affidavit that they're indigent and their ""vote"" is not guaranteed to be counted.  A person who doesn't have the time to go during work hours to get that ID, has no transportation to a DMV for that ID, or who can't obtain the documents necessary for the ID will have to declare their indigent and possibly get their vote tossed if they aren't.
So, here we go again.
On top of all of this, they want to make the Chief Justice position based on the election of the fellow justices (currently it's the most senior Justice and has been done that way for more than 100 years).  Naturally, they want to impose the will of the RW 4 of 7 justices who have bought their seats instead of having moderate Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson as the Chief based on her long history of service on the State Supreme Court.
And they've also succeeded in changing the reasons for recall to the reasons Scott Walker cited during his own recall.   There has been no reason necessary other than the will of the voters.  Now the recalled official must be charged and/or convicted of a felony or ethics violation.  This would make it impossible for Walker to have politically profited from the voter anger that made him Milwaukee County Executive had it been in effect 15 years ago.  It would also make it impossible for us to recall anyone for malfeasance in office or anything outside of criminal behavior.
I think we be ""safe"" from them for the next year.  They're done with their extremism until after the next election because they can't count on the poor memories of Wisconsinites or the power of their massive money to ensure their re-election.
They know no bottom and know no shame.

Steve LaTourette, the former Republican representative of Ohio's 14th Congressional District, just retired last week from Congress after 18 years in office. He is ""outspoken ally"" of Speaker John Boehner, writes Molly Ball at The Atlantic. That may be so, however comments he made in a post-retirement interview does not do any favors for the Speaker of the House. Ball asked LaTourette, why ""Boehner decided not to hold a vote on the bill to fund relief money for victims of Hurricane Sandy""?
LaTourette: The Sandy thing could have been handled better. But Boehner had expended so much political capital on the tax bill, and now these same 20 to 60 people were grousing that [the aid money] was unpaid for. You look at the roll call on the tax bill -- Boehner votes yes, and every other [member of the GOP leadership] except Cathy McMorris Rodgers voted no.
During the roll call on the tax bill, I walked into the cloakroom, and Boehner was sitting there. I said, 'This Sandy thing is really important. We've got to do something.' He said, 'Not tonight.' I asked if we were going to do it tomorrow, and he said no. He said, 'After this mess, I just can't do it tonight.'
Q: I don't understand. Was he just exhausted? Was he afraid the votes wouldn't be there?
LaTourette: He had expended a lot of political capital to get the 85 votes [on the fiscal-cliff deal], and he felt a little betrayed that the other members of the elected leadership walked on him. And the last piece was, as you saw during the Speaker election [Thursday], this sort of insurrection was forming against him. There was a fear that if he put $60 billion, no matter how worthy, of unpaid-for emergency spending on the floor, the insurrection would become bigger than it was.

So, there you have it people of New Jersey, New York, and others waiting for help in the Northeast. Boehner's sudden unwillingness to put the $60.4 billion in Sandy aid to a vote in the 112th Congress was to help save his own job in the 113th.

Welcome to the debut of my newest feature entitled ""Taking Back The House:  2014"".  I'm aware of the current truth that mid-terms are not a good time for the incumbent President's party.  We all remember what happened in 2010 and are unlikely to forget that night anytime soon.
However, I remain an optimist in the sense that the low popularity of the House Republicans will hurt them.  They are the party in power in the House and the wave that rode them to sweeping electoral victory, will be more subdued two years later.  When the Tea Party catches wind that some of their favorites voted for the ""fiscal cliff"" deal and have yet to do a thing other than obstruct, it might get fairly ugly for the GOP.
Or so we hope.


When I was thinking of how to start this feature, my brain immediately settled on one candidate that could signify what I’d aspire to get done.  I support a House in which most of its members do their jobs and are rarely known to anyone other than their constituents.  Of course, that’s impossible but when a candidate puts their political aspirations above their people (which is all-too-common on both sides of the aisle), they will be put on blast.  When regression, not progression, is the ultimate goal; they will deserve a spot here.
So who signifies that better than Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann.  Representing Minnesota’s 6th district since 2006, Bachmann probably deserves no introduction for all the headlines she has very proudly generated.  Yet, let’s take a look at the legislative, electoral and overall career of Michele Bachmann.

Legislation:
-Bringing up, for the 34th time, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
If there could be anything that will automatically earn you a place on this spot, it’s actions like these.  The ACA is the law of the land and slowly become more integrated into our health care system.  The fact that this cannot essentially get repealed until 2017 is noteworthy.  This is a bill that’s created to throw “red meat” to national conservatives and to generate some early headlines.  It’s a waste of time that could be used to well….stonewall other bills and make John Boehner weep but time nonetheless.
-The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act
This Bachmann’s other signature piece of legislation, another one that is advocating a repeal and another one that was not enacted.  The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act would signify the repeal of the government ban of incandescent light bulbs.
Headlines:
-Founder of the Tea Party Caucus
-Notably went on Hardball With Chris Matthews and encouraged investigations to determine if members of Congress were “anti-American”.
-Won Ames Straw Poll in 2011 which would lead to her collapsing in polls and dropping out of the presidential race the day after the Iowa Caucus.
-Claimed President Obama wanted to enact Sharia Law in America.
-Claimed Huma Abedin was part of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence even though she has no foreign policy credentials.  
Electoral History:
2006: Bachmann (R): 50.1%, Patty Wetterling (D): 42.1%, John Binkowski (I): 7.8%
2008: Bachmann (R): 46.4%, Elwyn Tinklenberg (D), 43.4%, Bob Anderson (I): 10%
2010: Bachmann (R): 52.5%, Taryl Clark (D): 39.8%, Anderson (I): 5.8%
2012: Bachmann (R): 50.5%, Jim Graves (D): 49.5%
Cook PVI:
R+10
Prospects:
I would say that this list should begin with Jim Graves, who gave Bachmann the closest run for her seat.  Graves is a small-business owner and a local Minnesotan who nearly won even by being outspent from 10:1 margin.  To learn more about Graves, check out his bio on his website here.
I believe that he is the best contender though I would like to hear what somebody from Minnesota might know.
Why We Can Do This:
The district is pretty significantly Republican but Bachmann has barely crossed over 50% of the vote, even in the tidal wave that was 2010.  Now, she is an amazing fundraiser but her reputation is so well-known that I don’t think money can erase all the obstruction she has done in the House.  Bachmann has reached her ceiling, it appears, so what the DFL of Minnesota might have to do is make this a very local race considering Bachmann is a highly national figure.
The fact that Bachmann has difficulties staying north of 50% gives us hope in 2014.  Fundraising for the opponent could be a national exercise and if started early enough, we could see some good results.
Remember if Bachmann is out of politics, it would be a huge blow to the Tea Party and would help us regain our sanity.
To sort of paraphrase her, “Repeal and Replace Bachmann”.
(Note on this feature:  We cannot sit idly as the majority Republican House does nothing.  Can we guarantee that a Democratic majority would change things?  Not at all.  But we can try.
Hence why I’m also putting this in your hands.  Share this on your Facebook, “like” candidate’s (which we will tout) Facebook pages, retweet posts from here and maybe even send it to your local Democratic Party.  If we are going to take back the House, with a fairly sizable Republican majority, then it’s going to take us.  The grassroots.
All campaigns are national, but stay local.  It would be great to have a Democratic Party that goes back to the “50-state strategy”.
But it all starts with us, the voters.  Us, the netrooters.  Us, the people.  Let’s start this project now and see what we are capable of.)
11:10 PM PT: 1/06/13 2:09AM:  Rec List?  Thank you all so much including the Rescue Rangers!  
-For those just reading or not reading, please mention in the comments how often we should all do this feature and any other ideas on how to make it better!  Thank you all.

From our ""see, this is why we can't have good things"" department, citizens of Florida learn what happens when you elect morons to control state legislatures -they pass idiotic legislation.
The Miami Herald and Huffington Post report:
When Florida lawmakers recently voted to ban all Internet cafes, they worded the bill so poorly that they effectively outlawed every computer in the state, according to a recent lawsuit.
In April Florida Governor Rick Scott approved a ban on slot machines and Internet cafes after a charity tied to Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll was shut down on suspicion of being an Internet gambling front -- forcing Carroll, who had consulted with the charity, to resign.
Florida's 1,000 Internet cafes were shut down immediately, including Miami-Dade's Incredible Investments, LLC, a café that provides online services to migrant workers, according to the Tampa Bay Times.


And, how not surprising is it to discover this effort is being led by our top Florida clown-fool, Rick Scott, who ""reportedly called the ban, 'the right thing to do for our state.""'



The owner of the internet cafe that helps migrant workers, Consuelo Zapata is suing the state after discovering that the bill was so poorly worded that ""it can be applied to any computer or device connected to the Internet,"" reports the Miami Herald.
But, what's going on here at Daily Kos? Am I the only one left from the group who vowed we would keep all of Florida Governor Rick Scott's Stupid Republican Tricks front and center until we can throw him out in the next election? Imagine my surprise and dismay to drop by and see this article has been up three hours already with no mention of it here, at my still favorite internet spot, Daily Kos.
When I stopped writing six months ago, in a grand funk of an intense election year-long burnout, I assumed the rest of you would keep on waiving our progressive flag, so, now, I just lurk here, occasionally, while resting up for the next election cycle.  
Let's get on the ball Kossacks! Winning back the Florida governorship should be a top goal, and with such a stellar goof ball like Rick Scott continueing to defy statistics by consistently pulling one boner after another - it should be a slam dunk -if we just keep the news of what these fools are doing in front of Florida voters.  
Don't make me come back up there!
Cheers and Happy Trails from your HoundDog friend.
PS If I might ask those of your you who remember me well to rec this meager post just for old times sake maybe I can get back my TU status so I can read the hidden comments and catch up on the gossip and down low.

Sen. Pete ""Baby daddy"" Domenici

Don't you just love the smell of a Republican sex scandal in the morning?
Former New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici told the Journal on Tuesday he fathered a son outside of his marriage over 30 years ago, revealing a secret kept for decades.
Statements given to the Journal by Domenici and the son’s mother, Michelle Laxalt of Alexandria, Va., identified the son as Adam Paul Laxalt, a Nevada lawyer. Michelle Laxalt formerly was a prominent government relations consultant and television political commentator in Washington, D.C. She is a daughter of former U.S. senator and Nevada Gov. Paul Laxalt. [...]
Michelle Laxalt said “one night’s mistake led to pregnancy” and she chose to raise the son as a single parent.

Now, far be it from us to judge what happens behind closed doors between consenting adults. After all, it's really no one's business if the former senator of New Mexico was diddling a colleague's daughter behind his wife's back. Clearly, such a private matter is nobody's business, and we should all stay out of it.
Oh, unless that senator happens to believe that the government has a vested interest in what happens behind closed doors between consenting adults, women have no right to privacy at all, and adultery ""rise[s] to the level of impeachable offenses that the Founding Fathers envisioned.""
Like Sen. Pete Domenici did when he was wandering the halls of the Senate in his pajamas. In which case, all bets are off. Head below the fold to find out why.


See, while Domenici was keeping his dirty little secret out of respect for his baby mama and his out-of-wedlock offspring, he was whistling a slightly different tune in public. Like when he voted to convict President Bill Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial because, among other things, ""[t]ruthfulness is the first pillar of good character in the Character Counts program of which I have been part of establishing in New Mexico."" Also, something about the president's ""tawdry"" sex acts, although it totally wasn't about that at all.
In fact, when he was a senator, Domenici was perfectly happy to invade the privacy of others and legislate what happens between consenting adults. Like all his votes to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Like all his votes to regulate vaginas—because while he believed that the woman he impregnated had a right to privacy, that right does not extend to women he didn't impregnate.
But at least, classy guy that he is, Domenici has finally come clean—decades later—to his family, and he's very sorry:
I deeply regret this and am very sorry for my behavior. I hope New Mexicans will view that my accomplishments for my beloved state outweigh my personal transgression. I only ask that everyone respect the privacy of my family and the son’s mother. None of them wanted this publicity, none of them deserve the hurt of this revelation, and only I should bear the brunt of this matter.
Yeah. Sure is awful when people think what happens in your private life is somehow their business, isn't it?

It's not every day that GOP defends itself by claiming to be two-faced



It's not every day that GOP defends itself by claiming to be two-faced

So far in 2013, House Speaker John Boehner has relied on Democratic votes to overcome overwhelming Republican opposition on back-to-back pieces of legislation: the Hurricane Sandy relief aid package on Tuesday night and the tax cliff deal from two weeks earlier. But if you think this proves that most Republicans have marginalized themselves and that Democrats are now an essential part of making the House function, House Majority Deputy Whip Tom Cole of Oklahoma says you're wrong. Why? Because, he says, secretly about half of Republicans who voted no actually wanted the legislation to pass:
Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, part of the Republican whip team responsible for marshaling support for legislation, said the current makeup of House Republicans could be divided roughly into a third who voted in favor of the bill because they wanted it to pass, a third who voted against the bill because they wanted it to fail, and a third who voted against the bill but had their fingers crossed that it would pass and avert a fiscal and political calamity.
One lawmaker, Mr. Cole said, told him that while he did not want to vote in favor of the bill, he also did not want to amend it and send it back to the Senate where it might die and leave House Republicans blamed for tax increases. “So I said, ‘What you’re really telling me is that you want it to pass, but you don’t want to vote for it,'” recalled Mr. Cole, who voted yes.

And why would a Republican vote no while secretly hoping for yes?
Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist and once the top spokesman for the former House speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican, described the phenomenon thusly: “These are people who are political realists, they’re political pragmatists who want to see progress made in Washington, but are politically constrained from making compromises because they will be challenged in the primary.”
In other words, about half of Republicans who vote with the hardline reactionary fringe aren't actually devoted wingnut true believers—they are actually just cowards, afraid of standing up to their political base. Whatever you think of the ethics of that, it's an invaluable insight for Democrats to remember as we move forward on issues like the debt limit. Take, for example, what the aforementioned Tom Cole said yesterday about the debt limit:
Congressman Cole is adamant that he will not accede to President Obama's unequivocal demand to raise it without any spending cuts tied to it.
“I couldn’t do that. I wouldn’t do that,"" Cole told me in a phone interview.
""We didn’t downgrade our credit [in 2011] because of the debt ceiling fight. We downgraded in my view because when we had the fight we didn’t cut enough,"" Cole said. ""Just raising the debt ceiling with no compromise sends the wrong message—that we think we can willy-nilly go on forever.""
""If there are not serious cuts, the Republican votes are not going to be there,"" Cole continued.

Tough talk, except this is the guy who just said half of Republicans who voted no on the tax cliff deal actually supported it. And given that Cole voted for the tax cliff deal and the  Hurricane Sandy package, it's not a shock that he might vote no on a clean debt deal, passing the responsibility to another one of his colleagues. But when you listen to a third interview with Cole, also from yesterday, it seems clear that he knows Republicans need to let the debt limit go up, no matter how he votes.
Even as Republican officials maintain the GOP majority is safe, several lawmakers and longtime activists warn of far-reaching political ramifications if voters perceive Republicans as botching consequential talks on the debt ceiling, sequestration and a possible government shutdown.
“Majorities are elected to do things, and if they become dysfunctional, the American people will change what the majority is,” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a House deputy majority whip and a former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman, told The Hill.

So basically we're looking at a House Republican Conference in which members want to (a) develop a voting record that protects them from primary challenges while (b) not actually having that voting record influence the final outcome, because if it does, then they worry they will lose the majority in the general election. And if that's not a golden opportunity for Democrats to put House Republicans on defense throughout the 113th Congress, then nothing is.

Further evidence that Tea Bagging Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (R - You're On Your Own) is a heartless Grinch.
An Iraq War combat veteran is hoping for a pardon from Gov. Scott Walker so he can become a police officer.
But Walker is refusing to budge from his practice of not issuing any pardons.

That's right.  No pardons.  Ever.
Eric Pizer returned from Iraq in 2004 after serving 2 tours with the Marines.  2 days after his return he went to the help a friend involved in a fight by trying to break it up and wound up being charged with battery.  He pleaded no contest, served 2 years of probation and paid over $7000 in medical bills after punching a man in the nose.
Now, 9 years later and with an associate degree in criminal justice, he wants to become a police officer.  His felony conviction prevents that.
A pardon would not erase the conviction but it would restore Pizer's right to possess a firearm, which he needs to become a police officer.
Scott Walker, when asked about the pardon request, suggested Pizer find another career (sorry, I saw it this weekend on the tee vee machine, but for the life of me can't find it today).
Another more in depth article can be found here.
It's interesting that Walker, who never put on a uniform to serve his country and currently hides behind the most massive security detail in Wisconsin history while pretending to be ""unintimidated"", would refuse to aid a decorated Marine veteran.  Also interesting to note is that one of his associates is getting out of prison early after stealing tens of thousands of dollars from a veterans fund put under his care and supervision by Scott Walker while he was Milwaukee County Executive.  Interesting to note that this early release was ordered by the state Department of Corrections headed by a Walker appointee.
This one case is being highlighted in the press because this man seems to be someone who qualifies to have a pardon considered.  A one-time offense which, he pled ""no contest"" to in order to avoid the expense and difficulty of a trial isn't part of a pattern of criminal or violent behavior.  That the incident occurred 2 days after his return from his second deployment after a night of drinking.
Walkers ""no pardon"" policy, regardless of merit, is the problem here.  There are people who deserve consideration and this man is only one of them.
Stay tuned for further episodes of Cruelty and Heartlessness, starting Scott Walker, a show continuously running in Wisconsin since January 2011.  We're hoping for a cancellation at the end of 2014.
Happy Holidays all!

I suspect Ian Bayne does not actually know who Rosa Parks was.



I suspect Ian Bayne does not actually know who Rosa Parks was.

Please stop.
On Friday, GOP congressional candidate Ian Bayne went all in, comparing [Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson] to civil rights icon Rosa Parks.
""In December 1955, Rosa Parks took a stand against an unjust societal persecution of black people, and in December 2013, Robertson took a stand against persecution of Christians,"" Bayne said in an email to supporters.
""What Parks did was courageous,"" he added. ""What Mr. Robertson did was courageous too.""

The ""stand"" Robertson took was to compare homosexuality to bestiality, also lumping them in with ""the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes"" and so forth, which makes him the Rosa Parks of people who think gay Americans are going to hell. (Really, though, has their been a dearth of good conservative Christians willing to pipe up about that? Not seeing the pioneer status of this particular reality TV star, myself.) Oh, and Robertson also had said that black Americans had it Just Fine Thank You during the Jim Crow era, which also makes him the Rosa Parks of people who think Rosa Parks didn't have anything to complain about in the first place.
Bayne is running to challenge Democratic Rep. Bill Foster in Illinois' 11th District next year, presuming he makes it through the primary. That primary being the reason he's sending out emails about Duck Dynasty stars and what they can teach us about being like Rosa Parks, of course.
I'll say this again: Congress is already very full of crackpots and frothing nutcases, thank you. We don't need any more. I don't know what letter went out in Republican circles that encouraged yet another raft of these loons to come sailing down the ol' wingnut river, but we are full up already.

You can tell just how insane the Republican Party has become when it can't even agree that prosecuting and reducing violence against women is a no-brainer. For nearly two decades, even Republicans supported the Violence Against Women Act, because what kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being would publicly take issue with that?
Well, on Tuesday, when the Senate voted, again, to re-authorize the VAWA, 22 senators—all Republicans, all men—raised their hands to proudly proclaim, ""I am that kind of horrible, rotten excuse of a human being!""
Let's take a look at some of these brave defenders of the sacred right to rape and beat the shit out of women:

There's Marco Rubio of Florida, the savior du jour of the Republican Party. He's the guy Republicans think will make them seem reasonable and not at all the party of old white guys because, hey, his parents are from Cuba and he speaks Spanish. Which is why, of course, he should have even greater sympathy for immigrants, and yet, for some reason, he has a real problem with VAWA protecting immigrants. Huh. Go figure.
There's Dr. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who never shies away from invoking his medical expertise to justify, say, opposing reproductive health care for women. See, when he supports laws to strip women of their rights, it's because he's a doctor, and he's simply acting out of concern for women. As a doctor. Funny that in all his years of practice, he apparently never encountered a victim of rape or domestic violence. Hell of a ""doctor,"" that guy.
There's Rand Paul of Kentucky, who thinks the government doesn't have the right to do a single thing except crawl up inside your vagina and regulate the hell out of it. Oh, and there was that one time in college when he kidnapped a woman—you know, as a joke. But hey, he probably has a really good reason for standing up for the rights of woman-beaters. Besides self-interest.
Ron Johnson of Wisconsin is the very model of chivalry, so it's hard to understand his opposition. After all, he so generously offered to mansplain how math and numbers and budgets work to his fellow Wisconsinite, Tammy Baldwin, when she was elected to the Senate in 2012. Guess he's fickle that way. He'll help the girls with their math homework, but if they get beaten, they're on their own.
James Inhofe of Oklahoma doesn't want to lift a finger to combat violence against women, but that's probably because he knows it isn't a real problem. Just like he knows climate change isn't a real problem. Just like he knows properly training and protecting women who are already in combat in the military isn't a real problem. In fact, the only real problem that concerns Inhofe is how to stop The Gays from taking over the world with their big gay agenda.

You can go below the fold for the full list of Republicans who don't give a damn about women. And be sure to sign the petition from Daily Kos and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee urging House Republicans to protect all women by passing the Senate version of the expanded, bipartisan Violence Against Women Act.

10 out of 11 Tea Party spokespeople quoted in major news outlets regarding the IRS scandal have ties to the Koch funded Americans for Prosperity.
The Internal Revenue Service, not the most popular government agency to begin with, has been in the midst of a scatological squall for the past 3 weeks over their treatment of tea party groups. According to an agency spokesperson, organizations garnered additional scrutiny of their applications for non-profit status for having “Tea Party, Patriot, or 9/12” in the application materials. Non-profit status is granted by the IRS for “social welfare organizations” and federal law puts legal limits to the amount of overtly political things you can do if you are applying to be a non-profit, and thus tax-exempt.
In the coverage of this story, now a scandal, there are a couple of important facts that some of the reporting has missed.
First is the fact that the tea party is a creation of enterprising political and public relations professionals, constructed to accomplish a political purpose. A study published in the Tobacco Control Journal actually traced the origins of the tea party to “free-market” groups founded by tobacco corporations and the oil industry billionaires David and Charles Koch.
According to researchers at UC San Francisco:
“Rather than being a grassroots movement that spontaneously developed in 2009, the Tea Party organizations have had connections to the tobacco companies since the 1980s. The cigarette companies funded and worked through Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), the predecessor of Tea Party organizations, Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, to accomplish their economic and political agenda.”
Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), was founded in 1984 by the Koch brothers.
There is even a tea party website registered to a Koch group in 2005, long before the conservative outcry we now know as the tea party began.
The second thing to keep in mind is that the tea party is still controlled by enterprising political and public relations professionals, funded by the David and Charles Koch. In coverage of the IRS scandal, there were 11 people who were involved in tea party groups quoted about IRS scrutiny. Of those 11, 10 have substantial ties to Americans for Prosperity (AFP). AFP (also founded and funded by the Kochs), is the direct descendent of  CSE  - one of the groups who registered a tea party site in 2005.  Of those 10 with ties to AFP, 2 actually work for the organization currently.  All 10 have received aid from AFP which included help with messaging and communication.
The tea party groups that were scrutinized by the IRS are not just separate grassroots citizen groups unfairly accused of political shenanigans, as the Koch associated spokespeople in the media would have you believe. They are one part of a wider political strategy, funded and managed by a very wealthy few. they have uniform and coordinated messages, such as attacking climate science andopposing environmental regulations.
As this IRS scandal progresses, it is important to keep in mind that many of the tea party groups in question deserve to have their non-profit, tax-exempt status questioned. The New York Times has already found that several tea party groups investigated by the IRS were engaged in activities that are illegal for tax exempt groups.
For the record, Greenpeace and Rainforest Action Network experienced expensive and debilitating audits by the IRS during George W Bush’s presidency. Those audits were most likely at the behest of an Exxon funded front group.

Cross posted from Blue Virginia
The HuffPo is out with a potentially explosive story, assuming that it's accurate. Check this out.
Republican state legislators in Virginia want so badly for the public to forget about the state's recent legislative battles over abortion that they have tried to strike a deal with Democrats to keep them quiet, a Democratic aide told The Huffington Post on Friday.
According to the legislative aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment (R) began meeting with Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw (D) in early December to discuss what state lawmakers have been referring to as a ""grand bargain"" on women's issues. According to the terms of the alleged deal, Democrats would lay low on the abortion issue in the media and drop efforts to repeal controversial anti-abortion laws that the Virginia General Assembly has recently passed, and in return, Republican leadership would send one GOP vote over to the Democrats' side on any new piece of anti-abortion legislation that is introduced in order to ensure that it does not pass. (The Virginia State Senate has 21 Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, and 20 Democrats.)
""It's about keeping media off the topic,"" the aide said. ""If Democrats came out swinging trying to repeal some of these laws, it's going get media coverage. [Republicans] really just want a state of neutrality.""



Clearly, that makes ZERO (or less than ZERO if that's possible) sense from the Democrats' point of view. In terms of policy, of course, the last thing we want to do is to acquiesce in any way to Virginia Republicans' incessant war on women's health and reproductive freedom. Politically speaking, the last thing we want to do, as we head into a crucial gubernatorial election year against one of the poster boys for the war on women (presumptive Republican nominee Ken Cuccinelli - yeah, this lunatic!), is to let Republicans off the hook for their ""personhood"" amendments; their ""transvaginal ultrasounds;"" their efforts to shut down women's health, family planning and abortion clinics across the state; etc. We certainly DO NOT want to keep this out of the media, to hush it up, or to lay low on this subject. A thousand times NO!
Thankfully, Democratic Attorney General candidate, State Senator Mark Herring (D-Loudoun, Fairfax), is all over this one.
Update: 4:59 p.m. -- Herring told The Huffington Post on Friday that no kind of bargain among Senate leadership could keep him from trying to repeal the abortion clinic regulations.
""Nobody's going to be able to muzzle me on these issues,"" he said. ""I wont be a part of any kind of a deal like that. This is about fighting for what's right for women.""

That about sums it up right there, thanks to Sen. Mark Herring for putting it so clearly. The bottom line: no way in HELL should we agree to back off our defense of women's reproductive freedom, health, and liberty! To the contrary, as Sen. Herring clearly understands, we should be redoubling our efforts to protect Virginia women's health from extremists' attacks. If you agree with this goal, please sign Sen. Herring's petition, and ""Tell Ken Cuccinelli and Bob McDonnell: Hands off women’s healthcare!""  Thanks.

The virulent meme spread across our nation with increasing frequency by Republicans and their racist adherents is that ""anti-racism"" is a code for ""anti-white."" This is part of a larger pattern of stigmatization of any groups or efforts made to address and redress the racial inequities we still face, and there are myriad variations on the theme, including ""reverse racism,"" ""reverse discrimination"" and ""playing the race card"" or simply a dismissal of anyone who attempts to combat racism by labeling them a racist.
Far too frequently we see headlines blasting racist blatherings by Republican politicians and party officials, local, state and national, and their faithful followers repeat these falsities ad nauseam on internet forums, in LTE's, newspaper comments and in personal conversations among family, friends and co-workers.
Just use your favorite search engine. It takes but a minute to turn up examples, which are distributed geographically: Texas Republican Official Peter Morrison Talks Secession, Reverse Racism (Jasper, Texas), GOP Rep. Goes on a Racial Rant (Montana), Racist Rant Gets GOP Chairman in Hot Water (Illinois).
This claptrap has now made its way onto a billboard in Harrison, Arkansas.
Since Daily Kos is a reality-based community, with a readership that has an interest in history, I thought it might be useful to discuss some of the facts with which you might wish to arm yourselves when confronted by this seemingly endless font of bigotry. This is in hopes that in some small way, when faced with any of these memes in the course of daily interactions, online or in real-life mode, you can at least put paid to a few of the most egregious lies and distortions.
No guarantee that pushback will change the minds of die-hard bigots, but we never know when facts may fall onto fertile ground, so we need to keep pushing them.

The organization that takes the hardest hit from those who clearly want to distort its message and purpose is the venerable NAACP, the oldest of the nation's civil rights organizations.
Headlines like, ""House freshman calls NAACP chief 'racist' in email"", ""Extremist Hate Group NAACP wants Robert E. Lee’s picture taken down in Florida"" (I'm not linking to the hate site that houses this gem) abound, and whoever the current head of both the national (currently Benjamin  Jealous, whose dad is white) or local NAACP groups is at the time, they are the target of warped Teapublican poutrages.
Other newer organizations, like the Southern Poverty Law Center, garner their fair share of sewage from both racists and anti-semites alike, since they were founded by Morris Dees (who is not Jewish but is attacked as if he is), and Joseph J. Levin, Jr.
I'm a card-carrying member of the NAACP and have always been fascinated by its history.  
The Birth of the NAACP
The Race Riot of 1908 in Abraham Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois had highlighted the urgent need for an effective civil rights organization in the U.S. This event is often cited as the catalyst for the formation of the NAACP. Mary White Ovington, journalist William English Walling and Henry Moskowitz met in New York City in January 1909 and the NAACP was born. Solicitations for support went out to more than 60 prominent Americans, and a meeting date was set for February 12, 1909. This was intended to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln, who emancipated enslaved African Americans. While the meeting did not take place until three months later, this date is often cited as the founding date of the organization.
The NAACP was founded on February 12, 1909 by a diverse group composed of W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Archibald Grimké, Henry Moskowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, William English Walling (the last son of a former slave-holding family),Florence Kelley, a social reformer and friend of Du Bois, and Charles Edward Russell, a renowned muckraker and close friend of Walling who helped plan the NAACP and served as acting chairman of the National Negro Committee (1909), a forerunner to the NAACP.
On May 30, 1909, the Niagara Movement conference took place at New York City's Henry Street Settlement House, from which an organization of more than 40 individuals emerged, calling itself the National Negro Committee. Du Bois played a key role in organizing the event and presided over the proceedings. Also in attendance was African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells-Barnett. At its second conference on May 30, 1910, members chose as the organization's name the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and elected its first officers, who were:
    National President, Moorfield Storey, Boston
    Chairman of the Executive Committee, William English Walling
    Treasurer, John E. Milholland (a Lincoln Republican and Presbyterian from New York)
    Disbursing Treasurer, Oswald Garrison Villard
    Executive Secretary, Frances Blascoer
    Director of Publicity and Research, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois.

Much to the surprise of many not familiar with this history, many of these founders were white. Though I spent years studying black history with W.E.B. Dubois and Ida Wells-Barnett as two of my favorite subjects, it wasn't until later in my studies that I focused on any of the white founders. I'll feature two of them here today.
 

NAACP founding member Mary White Ovington

Mary White Ovington:
Mary White Ovington was born April 11, 1865 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents, members of the Unitarian Church were supporters of women's rights and had been involved in anti-slavery movement. Educated at Packer Collegiate Institute and Radcliffe College, Ovington became involved in the campaign for civil rights in 1890 after hearing Frederick Douglass speak in a Brooklyn church. In 1895 she helped found the Greenpoint Settlement in Brooklyn. Appointed head of the project the following year, Ovington remained until 1904 when she was appointed fellow of the Greenwich House Committee on Social Investigations. Over the next five years she studied employment and housing problems in black Manhattan. During her investigations she met W.E.B. Du Bois and was introduced to the founding members of the Niagara Movement.
...On September 3, 1908 she read an article written by Republican William English Walling, also a Liberal, entitled ""Race War in the North"" in The Independent. Walling described a massive race riot directed at black residents in the hometown of Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois that led to seven deaths, the destruction of 40 homes and 24 businesses, and 107 indictments against rioters. Walling ended the article by calling for a powerful body of citizens to come to the aid of blacks. Ovington responded to the article by writing Walling and meeting at his apartment in New York City along with social worker Dr. Henry Moskowitz. The group decided to launch a campaign by issuing a call for a national conference on the civil and political rights of African-Americans on the centennial of Lincoln’s birthday, February 12, 1909...
After the war, Ovington served the NAACP as board member, executive secretary and chairman. The NAACP fought a long legal battle against segregation and racial discrimination in housing, education, employment, voting and transportation. They appealed to the Supreme Court to rule that several laws passed by southern states were unconstitutional and won three important judgments between 1915-1923 concerning voting rights and housing...Ovington retired as a board member of the NAACP in 1947, ending 38 years of service with the organization. She died on July 15, 1951.


William English Walling, Chairman of NAACP Executive Committee (1910–1911)

William English Walling:
William English Walling (1877–1936) (known as ""English"" to friends and family) was an American labor reformer and Socialist Republican born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was the grandson of William Hayden English, the Democratic candidate for vice president in 1880, and was born into wealth. He was educated at the University of Chicago and at Harvard Law School. He was a co-founder of the NAACP, and founded the National Women's Trade Union League in 1903.
In 1906, following a trip to Russia to report on the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905 he married Anna Strunsky, a Jewish immigrant and an aspiring novelist from San Francisco. In 1908 he published Russia's Message, a book inspired by the social unrest he and his wife had observed in Russia. In 1908 Walling and his wife went to Springfield, Illinois to investigate a race riot. As a result of their investigations, Walling wrote an article The Race War in the North for the September 3 issue of The Independent, in which he stated, “the spirit of the abolitionists, of Lincoln and Lovejoy, must be revived and we must come to treat the negro on a plane of absolute political and capitalist equality.” He also appealed for a “large and powerful body of citizens to come to their aid.” The article directly led to the founding of the NAACP.

So here we have two staunch anti-racists who helped found an anti-racist organization 104 years ago. Clearly not anti-white. But let's fast forward to today. Though the NAACP does not keep racial demographics for its membership, and yes, a majority are black Americans, NAACP membership is open to all. The current head of the Aiken County, South Carolina Branch of the NAACP, Phillip Howell, is white. There are also local chapter heads who are Latino.
I always find it odd that no one on the right has ever accused me of being ""anti-black"" because of my membership to a whole range of mainly ""white"" organizations over the years, from the ACLU to the AARP. In fact, no one ever calls them ""white"" groups at all, they are just ""groups,"" because white is the norm that needs no descriptor in our society, one must add an adjective to describe anything else.
I've voted for white presidents and white senators, attended mostly white colleges and universities, with the exception of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard, due to its history and founding purpose, is ""a historically black college"" (HBCU), which of course obfuscates the fact it has over the years graduated white students, especially from the medical school during a time when Ivy League med schools had a Jewish quota. Howard was founded by a white man—Oliver O. Howard, for whom it is named. I remember having a conversation with Harris Wofford during the time he was the president of SUNY Old Westbury, before he became a senator from Pennsylvania. He mentioned having attended Howard Law school.
The history of the civil rights movement in this country is one that has been forged out of the activism of people of all backgrounds. I'm always surprised when people question me about my former membership in the Black Panther Party, assuming it was anti-white, simply because of it having ""black"" in the name, and its militancy. Yet anyone familiar with the history of the Rainbow Coalition forged by Fred Hampton knows that to be a lie as well.
So next time you encounter someone, online or in real life, spreading faux propaganda about the NAACP or any anti-racist group, hit them with the facts.
Better still, if you are white, why not join me in becoming a card-carrying NAACP member. Then you can show them your ""card"" for real.

628,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/09/30/1242615/-No-menorahs-at-Hobby-Lobby,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,No menorahs at Hobby Lobby,"












Hobby Lobby owner David Green notoriously sued the government (which is still being challenged) because he doesn't want to cover birth control for his employees—who, like his shoppers, happen to be mostly women.
Now comes word there is yet another reason to avoid getting your crafty supplies and holiday decorations from Hobby Lobby. They recently opened a new store in New Jersey and blogger Ken Berwitz discovered last week that Hobby Lobby doesn't sell any Hanukkah merchandise. Not a single menorah. Not a single dreidel.
In the past few days two different friends told my wife they had gone into the new hobby lobby store in Marlboro, New Jersey and noticed that, although there already was a lot of Christmas merchandise available, there was none for the Jewish holiday of Chanukah (some people drop the ""C"" and spell it Hannukah.  Same holiday).
One of our friends entered the store, asked where the Chanukah goods were, was told there wouldn't be any, and asked why.  According to her, the answer was:
""We don't cater to you people""
Understandably irate, she called the home office, and was told, indifferently, that hobby lobby doesn't have Chanukah on its list of holidays.
Since I did not hear this ugly exchange with my own ears, I was not personally certain it was the case.  And that's not good enough for this blog.  So I just called the Marlboro hobby lobby and asked whether it would be stocking any Chanukah merchandise.  I was told it would not.  When I asked why, the answer - verbatim - was:
""Because Mr. Green is the owner of the company, he's a Christian, and those are his values""
FYI, I would guess that, in a five mile radius around the Marlboro store, a solid one-third of all residents are Jewish.  But, then again, what is the difference?  The reason hobby lobby won't sell Chanukah goods is unrelated to how many Jews are in the area,

Over the weekend, backlash started to build and as of this morning, the company says:
In a brief email to Patch, Hobby Lobby representative Vincent Parker said, ""We currently do not carry any Hanukah items in our store. Our customers have brought this to our attention and we are currently evaluating our Holiday items and what we will carry in the future.""
Parker did not comment on the alleged remarks by a Hobby Lobby employee, and did not confirm the conversation ever happened.

For what it's worth, I went to their Facebook page and asked whether they would confirm whether they do or do not sell any Hanukkah merchandise, and while my comment/question is still visible on the page, the ensuing conversation has been deleted. They seem to be responding to questions about a variety of friendly topics such as new store openings, discounts, etc., but questions from consumers about their policy on Hanukkah merchandise remain unanswered. UPDATE: All comments and questions regarding Hannukah merchandise are now being deleted from their Facebook page.
EDIT: as Colorado Luis points out, they won at the tenth circuit and the Obama administration is now challenging.

As has already been diaried by Hunter, one of the authors of the discredited Heritage 'study' on immigration turns out to have written a dissertation on the need to exclude Hispanic immigration due to their alleged lower IQs.  Others have already discussed/explained/facepalmed the obvious bigotry of this position.  I am more concerned with another question.
Who the fuck signed off on Richwine's dissertation?


Richwine 'earned' his PhD in Public Policy in 2009 from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.  His dissertation committee consisted of
George J. Borjas (chair)
Richard J. Zeckhauser
Christopher Jenks
Borjas is your basic, run-of-the-mill anti-immigrant conservative, with substantial scholarly and popular works explaining just how bad brown people are for America.
Zeckhauser is more of a money guy, but his wikipedia page describes him as one of ""the ""whiz kids"" assembled by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara to apply cutting-edge analysis to Cold War military strategy.""
The oddball in this list is Christopher Jenks.  Jenks is currently on the editorial board of the American Prospect and many decades ago he was the editor of the New Republic.  In the acknowledgements of Richwine's dissertation, he states that
I want to thank my Harvard committee members, starting with George Borjas, who helped me navigate the minefield of early graduate school and has now seen me through to the finish. Richard Zeckhauser, never someone to shy away from controversial ideas, immediately embraced my work and offered new ideas as well as incisive critiques. Christopher Jencks generously signed on as the committee's late addition and offered his own valuable input.
Reading between the lines, it seems to me that someone refused to pass the dissertation as written, and Jenks was brought in late.
Whatever else, these three people signed and passed Richwine's obviously bigotted and substandard dissertation.  A dissertation that was so obviously wrong and bigoted that the Heritage Foundation...the Heritage Foundation...distanced themselves from Richwine immediately.
These three professors should be held publicly accountable.  More-so, I believe that the signatures of these professors demonstrate, unequivocally, that simple bigotry resides at the heart of movement conservatism--and that this bigotry is no different whether taking about teabaggers or 'scholars'.
The dean of the Kennedy School of Government is David T. Ellwood, (david_ellwood@Harvard.Edu).  I've already dropped him a line asking why the School awarded Richwine a PhD and what they plan to do in the future to prevent it from happening again. Perhaps you might as well.
Thu May 09, 2013 at 12:12 PM PT: Sorry to have been absent from this diary for so long now.  When I posted it I never thought it would get to the rec list, and I was frankly startled to see it still there when I woke up this morning.  I stuck around as long as I could.
A couple thoughts to add after all the comments.
1. Clearly there is too much variation and potential hijinks about PhD committees for my claim that the late addition of Jencks might show some problems in getting people to sign off on the dissertation.  That was based on my experience as a professor in one discipline and school.  Clearly, every school and discipline seems to do things differently.  So, I concede that I overstated that.
2. Many folks are saying things like Harvard is a bullshit institution, Bush got his MBA there, it is a school for the 1%, etc.  At some level all of that is true.  I have my PhD (not from Harvard), and I would be the first to admit that a PhD does not indicate some great level of intelligence.  That said, there is a difference between a PhD and an MBA, and while Harvard is seriously over-rated, they aren't the simple hacks some claim them to be.  A Harvard PhD does still mean something to many folks.
I can live with dumb people getting PhDs for dumb things.  Its always happened and it always will.  But a PhD for what is basically a low-budget version of 19th and early-20th century eugenics?  No, that is too fucking far.  That is beyond what is acceptable.

Hancock County Ohio Sheriff Michael Heldman

Think law nullification is a quaint old timey southern strategy that was used to defend slavery in the 1860's and segregation in the 1960's? An Ohio Sheriff actually wrote a letter to President Obama not only implying the President is an enemy of the people but that the Sheriff would refuse to enforce any law which he personally didn't agree. That's right, he thinks the oath he took to uphold the laws and constitution of Ohio and the United States allows him to nullify laws in which he personally objects.



In a letter dated February 1st, Hancock County Ohio Sheriff Michael Heldman decided to tell off the President of the United States:
It is with my blessing and my elected position as sheriff of Hancock County, Ohio, that the right of the people in the county which I represent will continue to keep and bear arms for their defense and security, and that right will not be infringed upon by any enemy, foreign or domestic.
...
Any edict, regulation, or so-called 'federal law' which infringes on the right of the citizens of Hancock County, Ohio to keep and bear arms for their security will not be tolerated, recognized or enforced by me or my office.

Yep, Sheriff Heldman not only implies President Obama and the Congress are enemies of the people, but he is actually telling the chief law enforcer of the United States that he will refuse to enforce any law or regulation of his choosing.
That takes balls. He is absolutely bonkers but ballsy. Sheriff Michael Heldman must resign his office.
Heldman needs to re-read the Constitution. Article III only allows review of laws by the courts.
And then we have Article VI, Clause 2 also called the Supremacy Clause:
This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
Sheriff Heldman took an oath to enforce the laws as set by the local, state, and Federal legislatures. He can't pick and choose what laws he will enforce. He also isn't allowed to decide what laws are constitutional. That is for the courts to decide. Now if he wants to become a lawyer and then get appointed to a Federal court then he could make those decisions.
It's not like nullification is a new idea. It has been tried whenever a group of people have strongly disagreed with some laws.
During the nullification crisis of 1828 to 1834, South Carolina planter politicians formulated a new brand of slavery-based politics that would culminate in the formation of the southern confederacy. The crisis, which began as a dispute over federal tariff laws, became intertwined with the politics of slavery and sectionalism. Led by John C. Calhoun, a majority of South Carolina slaveholders claimed that a state had the right to nullify or veto federal laws and secede from the Union. Nullification and secession, according to Calhoun, were the reserved rights of the states and therefore constitutional. Calhoun's constitutional theories and the overtly proslavery discourse of the nullifiers laid the political and ideological foundation for southern nationalism.
Nullification Crisis of 1828 to 1834

The result of the efforts of these attempts at nullification eventually led to the Civil War which the south lost and slavery was ended.
The US Supreme Court has also ruled nullification unconstitutional:
In the case of Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), the Supreme Court rejected the Arkansas effort to use nullification and interposition. The state of Arkansas passed several laws in an effort to prevent the integration of its schools. The Supreme Court, in its only opinion to be signed by all nine justices, held that state governments had no power to nullify the Brown decision. The Supreme Court held that the Brown decision and its implementation ""can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executive or judicial officers nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation whether attempted 'ingeniously or ingenuously.'""
Cooper v. Aaron (1958)

One doesn't even have to go back that far to find Heldman needs to resign his office.
The Sheriff needs to review the US Constitution and the most recent court decisions about guns especially District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) where the US Supreme court held that the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects an individual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home and within federal enclaves and McDonald v. Chicago (2010) which extended that protection to the states.
Heldman also admitted to the Findlay Ohio Courier that the 1994 assault weapons ban wasn't enforced in Hancock county.
If an elected official, who took an oath to enforce all laws, can't, through moral or personal objections, enforce those laws, then that elected official needs to resign his office immediately.
Hancock County Ohio Sheriff Michael Heldman must resign.
Here's the letter:

Update
Thanks for getting this on the Rec List.
Some commentors have pointed out a few things. A local Sheriff doesn't generally enforce Federal laws and Heldman's proposed action isn't any different than some local law enforcers who look the other way about certain drugs laws, draconian immigration laws, or other laws that a police officer thinks is stupid.
Those are valid points and wasn't something I thought about when writing my post.
If Heldman wrote in his letter and said Obama sucked and he hated the gun laws or the invisible gun laws that Rush and Hannity say are coming then I wouldn't pay attention to the guy and chalk him up to just another winger - which he is anyway.
I know that police use discretion when they can about enforcing laws - more about time and place than filling the jails. Most people call it ""getting a break"". It just happens and if someone raises a stink then we are back to where Heldman is now.
However Heldman's public letter and implying that the government was the enemy smacked of George Wallace and the other segregationists from the civil rights era. ""Normal"" police discretion isn't publicly announced in this way. That is what made me write a post about it.
I personally think there is a difference between laws that benefit the public good and those that single out and punish a certain class of people. The legislature can and does make mistakes - DOMA anyone? But these are still laws on the books and until they are changed or repealed by the lawmakers or the courts, law enforcement is obligated to enforce them.
I see it the same no matter who does it and the reason why. Police who use their discretion in extreme ways also need to resign then. It isn't their job to decide what laws to enforce. They can complain about those laws and even participate like all voters can and petition lawmakers to change the laws, but they can't publicly come out and defy a law they don't like.
Heldman basically just gave a reason he shouldn't be Sheriff and he should resign.

I have a new and self-imposed policy that I follow when I see a news report of some bull-headed politician proposing some law to put low-level drug possessors in prison. That rule? Follow the money, of course.
Because something hideous is festering under the surface of these laws. It's the private prison lobby, which makes campaign contributions to secure harsher penalties. You see, these prison companies are in need of warm bodies, since they can put those people to work inside the walls of those prisons. The companies double-dip, too, pulling in a guaranteed sum from the state in addition to whatever they can make with their legalized slave labor. Weed offenders are just the sorts of people these prison profiteers are looking for. They're mostly non-violent people who will comply. They can be put to work without much worry.
This week, Indiana got into the mix, as its governor Mike Pence pushed for changes to legislation on drug crime. Among his suggested changes:
Tougher marijuana possession and dealing penalties could be added to a proposed overhaul of Indiana's criminal sentencing laws by legislators after Gov. Mike Pence questioned whether the plan was strict enough on low-level drug offenders.
One proposed change expected to be voted on Thursday would make possession of between about one-third of an ounce and 10 pounds of marijuana the lowest-level felony rather than the highest-level misdemeanor.

Why would this Republican governor suggest policies designed mostly for the destruction of communities and budgets alike? Mostly because he and others are politically aligned with the very prison companies that run the show.



GEO Group is one of the largest private prison companies in the country. Based in Florida, GEO is a nationwide political player. It makes the majority of its contributions in its home state, but it's been known to contribute to federal and state elections in places like California, New Mexico, Virginia, and, believe it or not, Indiana.
Over the last decade, GEO Group has spent more than $3 million in direct campaign contributions, the majority of that money going to Republican candidates and causes. This is most likely on the low end of estimates, too, since many state contribution records are either incomplete or missing altogether.
Indiana is eighth on the list of states where GEO does its spending, as it's sunk more than $60,000 into state elections there. It specifically contributed $12,500 to the 2012 Pence campaign, which doesn't seem like much without context. That contribution made GEO one of Pence's top 30 corporate contributors, ranking in front of US Steel Corp, Caterpillar, and Koch Industries.
The group has also thrown its financial weight behind Brian Bosma, the Indiana State House Speaker, who has been quoted as saying:
“As an entry drug, I think marijuana is more powerful than it’s given credit for,” he said. “I know some states have taken that step (to legalize it), but I don’t find it advisable at this point.”
Business has been quite good for GEO in Indiana. In 2005, they signed a contract to operate a prison in New Castle. That first contract reads like many that GEO signs with its depraved partners. Indiana guaranteed a prison population roughly 90% of capacity. Or, as the state's excited press release put it:
During the first year of operation, the 2,416-bed prison is expected to house approximately 1,068 security level 1-4 adult male inmates for the Indiana Department of Correction and generate approximately $12.8 million. Under the terms of the contract, GEO will be paid for a guaranteed average daily population of 961 inmates, or 90 per cent of the initial contract capacity, following a ramp-up period of approximately four weeks.
Some might argue that private prison companies are worth it. After all, the private market is better equipped to handle things effectively and efficiently, right? Wrong:
State Police responded to the prison around 2 p.m., where inmates set fires outside the cell blocks.
Mayor Tom Nipp described the situation as, ""A full-scale riot.""  Nipp says police have set up a perimeter around the prison, assuring residents that no one has escaped.
Video taken by Chopper 13 shows inmates standing near small flames that appear to be mattresses set on fire.
The Indiana Department of Corrections confirms the disturbance involved prisoners from Indiana and prisoners from Arizona.  Tear gas was used by correctional officers and State Police to gain control.  Police moved hundreds of prisoners outside to an area along the outer fence line while cell blocks were searched for others involved in the riots.

The Indiana governor wants to make possession of small amounts of marijuana a felony because, apparently, we aren't nearly hard enough on those non-violent pot smokers. Or something. Lurking beneath the surface is an insidious actor. The unmentioned hand of political influence guides his actions, as prison corporations like GEO own their candidates and wreck state criminal codes.

White people eat it too, y'know. Just think of Colonel Sanders!



White people eat it too, y'know. Just think of Colonel Sanders!

Saying black people like fried chicken is an old stereotype. Saying black people and Latinos are poor because they like fried chicken is a new twist. But presented with statistics on racial disparities in the poverty rate, that was Colorado state Sen. Vicki Marble's explanation:
“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race: sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up, diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup and you just can’t help it,” Marble said. “Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better BBQ and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down south and you — I love it.”
Marble went on to mention how Mexicans eat vegetables in Mexico but stop eating healthily when they immigrate to the United States.
“These things aren’t good for you,” she continued. “There’s so many attributing factors as to why these graphs look the way they do.”

Also in there somewhere, she mentioned a restaurant called ""Type II Chicken,"" which she had always wanted to eat at, and also that ""an idle mind is the devil's workshop."" She was rambling, is what I'm saying. Free-associating about the causes of poverty. And her free-associating led her to—actually kind of kicked off with—the idea that black people are genetically flawed and like fried chicken.
Marble's epic four minutes-plus ramble on poverty (which she began wrapping up only when she was cut off by the task force chair saying ""it seems like there's a repetition there and I think the point is made"") ended with a ""question"" aimed at suggesting that the War on Poverty had made things worse. So while she mentioned a whole lot of things along the way, her basic points were to blame either people of color or policies to combat poverty or both for high infant mortality and low life expectancy among poor black and Latino people. Which kind of contradicts her statement that she's ""saddened"" her comments were taken as disparaging and that ""I hope our work on this committee will offer real solutions to the health and financial challenges of our vulnerable populations,"" unless of course you think ""black people shouldn't eat so much fried chicken and the War on Poverty made things worse"" are real solutions.

(Photograph of non-starving woman and children during the Great Depression, courtesy of blsciblogs.baruch.cuny.edu) and Dorothea Lange, documentary photographer employed by the Federal Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security Administration from 1935 - 1939)
John Stossel has said some pretty ridiculous crap over the years, but this might take the prize for the most insensitive, moronic thing that has ever come out of his piehole:
Fox Business host John Stossel on Thursday declared that government programs should be cut based on the false assertion that “no one” died of starvation in the Great Depression before the modern “welfare state.” [...]
“And when people are needy you want them [to get] help,” Stossel agreed. “But think about the [Great] Depression. That was before there was any welfare state at all. How many people starved? No one.”
“Right, good point,” Doocy agreed.

Really John?  No one starved to death during the Great Depression? That's not how a lot of people remember those years.
In the Pennsylvania coal fields, three or four families crowded together in one-room shacks and lived on wild weeds. In Arkansas, families were found inhabiting caves. In Oakland, California, whole families lived in sewer pipes.
President Herbert Hoover declared, ""Nobody is actually starving. The hoboes are better fed than they have ever been."" But in New York City in 1931, there were 20 known cases of starvation; in 1934, there were 110 deaths caused by hunger. There were so many accounts of people starving in New York that the West African nation of Cameroon sent $3.77 in relief.

We will never know how many people died as a result of starvation or illness related to malnutrition during the years of the Great Depression because there were no official Federal Government statistics for that era.  [Deleted reference to Russian researcher] However, there is enough anecdotal evidence that people did starve during the Great Depression, and that contrary to what Mr. Stossel asserts now, and President Hoover asserted then, people did in fact die from lack of adequate food intake, otherwise known as death by starvation.  We certainly have a photographic record of people who look very thin and malnourished as evidence that starvation was a reality for many people during the Depression:

We also know that food riots broke out in many states.  Well fed people, or even adequately fed people do not riot over food.  Hungry, starving people on the other hand do:
Feb. 1931
""Food riots"" begin to break out in parts of the U.S. In Minneapolis, several hundred men and women smashed the windows of a grocery market and made off with fruit, canned goods, bacon, and ham. One of the store's owners pulled out a gun to stop the looters, but was leapt upon and had his arm broken. The ""riot"" was brought under control by 100 policemen. Seven people were arrested.

And another food riot incident, this time in Oklahoma:
From the New York Times, January 31, 1931.
Food Rioters Raid Oklahoma City Store; 500 Dispersed by the Police With Tear Gas
OKLAHOMA CITY. Jan. 20 (AP)-A crowd of men and women, shouting that they were hungry and jobless, raided a grocery store near the City Hall today. Twenty-six of the men were arrested. Scores loitered near the city jail following the arrests, but kept well out of range of fire hoses made ready for use in case of another disturbance.
      The police tonight broke up a second meeting of about one hundred unemployed men and arrested Francis Owens, alleged head of the ""Oklahoma City Unemployed Council,"" who was accused of instigating the raid.

People starved Mr. Stossel.  They went hungry.  Some of them, we don't know how many, died, either from the direct effects of starvation or from malnutrition and  illnesses related to their lowered resistance to disease caused by, yes, starvation.  And guess what?  More people would be dying today if we didn't have social welfare programs such as SNAP (i.e., food stamps) to prevent poor people, and the unemployed from going without food.  Yet you want to eliminate these programs.  In fact you stated that you wanted to eliminate the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Education, among others.  
You cut whole departments,” the Fox Business host explained. “Why do we have a Commerce Department? Commerce just happens! Agriculture, farmers do that! You don’t need bureaucrats.”
He added that the Department of Education was also unnecessary.
“Isn’t that part of what the government does in a lot of people minds?” Fox News host Steve Doocy asked. “They need to help people rather than let people help themselves?”

Guess what you left off your list?  The entire Department of Defense.  Well hell's bells, why do we need a wasteful military establishment when we have an armed militia available?  Using your logic, our military forces are completely unnecessary, because individuals can take care of that themselves when it comes to national defense.  Just like social welfare programs are unnecessary.  Please let me know, from your libertarian perspective, why the largest Department in the Federal Government and the one whose elimination, or even significant down-sizing, would solve most of our debt issues going forward is left off your list.  I'm dying to find out why you failed to mention it, though you have no problem with killing off social welfare programs that millions of your fellow citizens depend upon.
UPDATE: Further evidence of the effects of starvation among the poor in the United States during the Great Depression era and the years leading up to it (i.e., before the development of our current socialist hellhole welfare state) can be found at the Link (h/t to mollyd from the comments.
UPDATE 2:  Stossel has issued a classic nopology:
This morning, on Fox and Friends, I said ""no one"" starved during the Depression. I was almost certainly wrong.
During the Depression, the governor of Pennsylvania wrote, ""we know that starvation is widespread, but no one has enumerated the starving."" However, all other governors who wrote to Congress, 43 of them, sent letters saying that they knew of no starvation in their states. Historians Steven Mintz and Sara McNeil wrote that there were hundreds of deaths in NYC alone.
However, hunger was rare enough that health in America generally improved during the Depression, according to a National Academy of Sciences study [...]
There's no doubt that there was privation of all sorts in the 30's - when America was much poorer. But today's reduction in malnutrition is almost entirely a result of greater prosperity, thanks to our relatively free market.
Our unsustainable welfare state causes poverty (by rewarding dependency) as often as it relieves it. Stopping government handouts to people like ME won't lead to starvation.

Stossel forgets to mention that part of that ""improvement"" was related to advances in medicine, and part only looked like improvement, since the 1918-1920 ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic which killed millions skewed the statistics by making the pre-Roaring Twenties look very deadly in comaparison.  He also forgets that under FDR, federal funding for vaccinations increased significantly under FERA (the Federal Emergency Relief Administration) which in all likelihood led to better health outcomes and fewer childhood deaths.

Yesterday, in the wake of the tenth Moral Monday demonstration at the General Assembly building, the New York Times editorial board published a short piece called ""The Decline of North Carolina"".  It is an excellent, if short and necessarily incomplete, summary of what is going on here; and well worth the read.
Every Monday since April, thousands of North Carolina residents have gathered at the State Capitol to protest the grotesque damage that a new Republican majority has been doing to a tradition of caring for the least fortunate.
That's the opening line of the editorial, and a great way to introduce a national audience to this latest example of Republican extremism, and to the growing movement against that extremism.


Here's a bit more from the editorial, which again is well worth the read ...
In January, after the election of Pat McCrory as governor, Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction. Since then, state government has become a demolition derby, tearing down years of progress in public education, tax policy, racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot.
The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week: ending federal unemployment benefits for 70,000 residents. Another 100,000 will lose their checks in a few months.

I also saw that Amy Goodman included the Moral Monday protests in yesterday's Democracy Now broadcast.  As this movement is building in North Carolina, the national attention it is getting, and that it is bringing upon the actions of the Republican legislature and governor, is growing as well.  This is, after all, not just a North Carolina story.
This is a part of the story that is unfolding in Texas, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and other states where the more extreme elements of the Republican party have gained power on the state level and are exacting laws that, to use the words of the Times editorial board, are doing grotesque damage; and where the people are standing up and pushing back.  This is a national story, and a national movement.  We are bringing awareness to the people of this country to what happens when Republicans are given power at the state level; and we are encouraging them to think a bit more deeply, and to take action.
For more on these protests, see today's diary by Leslie Salzillo and yesterday's diary by MsSpentyouth.
Thank you New York Times and Amy Goodman for increasing national attention; and thanks to everyone who is supporting this movement, if North Carolina, in Texas, in every state where folks are standing up and pushing back.

Here is the latest on the GOP's government shutdown and default.
- President Obama formally rejected the House GOP proposal to extend the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown for a limited time subject to the ransom of medicare cuts.  It was no surprise to sane minds that the President rejected the proposal.  The surprise is that the House GOP seemed genuinely surprised and angry about it.  Such is the delusional mentality of the House GOP.
- President Obama came out firing in his Saturday radio address, slamming the House GOP shutdown/default by name and demanding a simple end to the hostage strategy.
- Harry Reid firmly rejected the less hostile, but still offensive, GOP proposal from Senator Collins which provided too little in the way of ending the debt ceiling and government shutdown crisis and demanded some changes to the ACA, some of which were potentially far reaching from a budgetary standpoint (delay of medical device tax) and from an eligibility standpoint (income verification).  As Senator Patty Murray succinctly stated:  the GOP has to stop using hostages as a pre-condition to allow the people's government to function.  For his part, Senator Reid bluntly stated that opening the government and lifting the debt ceiling are not concessions to Democrats but are two of the basic functions of the US Congress.  Therefore, presenting such proposals were simply inappropriate.
- Harry Reid emerged to take over direct negotiations in place of the White House.  Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Lindsay Graham are out (thank god!).  Mitch McConnell and Lamar Alexander are now talking with Reid and Schumer.  There is some reporting to suggest that Senate Democrats were a bit wary of a late inning White House cave, and Reid seized control from Obama before that weed could take root.  In truth, Obama and Reid seemed much more coordinated in their responses.  President Obama rejected the House GOP proposal within the same hour that Senator Reid rejected the Senate GOP proposal.
- Paul Ryan, the dark lord of the GOP and orchestrator of the default strategy (which, believe it or not, makes the tea party look sane by comparison) seemed especially perturbed by the President's rejection of his proposal and Boehner's willingness to punt the issue to the Senate.  He was reportedly very animated, defiant and angry, demanding that the House GOP reject any Senate crafted proposal (including the Collins proposal (which Reid had already rejected)).  He riled up the GOP caucus which further encouraged Boehner to punt the issue to the Senate and look the other way.    Never has the US seen a more ineffective Speaker of the House than John Boehner.
- Harry Reid has pushed the Senate GOP very aggressively.  He wants a longer debt ceiling extension and a shorter CR in order to replace the sequester. It also appears that he is looking to replace much of the sequester in this proposed legislation, meaning that much of the sequester could theoretically be repealed effective this month.  


In my view, Harry Reid has been given free rein by the President to push the GOP to repeal the sequester.  Obama first brought up the issue with Lindsay Graham in the context of the Collins proposal.  Obama and Reid were of the same mind on the crappy Paul Ryan House GOP proposal that it was an insulting non-starter.  Regarding the Senate GOP proposal, Obama was willing to entertain some concessions in order to replace the sequester but Reid prevailed to push Obama to remain philosophically consistent and convinced the President that the Collins proposal was a bit of a Trojan horse.  Reid now has a few days to run the show to play bad cop to Obama's good cop.  Neither cop wants to do business with the House GOP. Boehner is only too happy to sit on the sidelines and watch football this weekend.  The Senate GOP feels embattled but doesn't think it can trust the House to do anything.
Mitch McConnell has willingly accepted the role of GOP negotiator and has openly stated that he intends to reach a compromise with Democrats.  This is potentially significant because McConnell is more likely to bend to the Democrats because he faces a credible Democratic opponent in the 2014 Senate elections (Grimes) and Democratic Governor Steve Beshear is almost single-handedly validating Obamacare through the Kynect program.  He also doesn't seem to be too threatened by his tea party opponent (Bevin)in the GOP Senate primary (a harbinger of things to come in red states in 2014?)
In addition, Chuck Todd reported that when McConnell recently tried to sell the sequester as  GOP success to base GOP voters, it did not move them very much.  Therefore, McConnell may be more willing to jettison the sequester than we realize, particularly since it was hurting the GOP long before the shutdown and because most of the year 2 sequester cuts will fall on the military.
So Harry Reid has a shot to get an agreement that extends the debt ceiling for a longer period (6 months to 1 year), ends the shutdown with a shorter CR and/or replaces the sequester.  If Reid fails, he may be able to push the Overton window far enough to the left where the GOP might feel that simply passing a clean CR and debt ceiling increase at current levels might be the best solution.
The problem, of course, is the House of Representatives and particularly Paul Ryan.  The good news is that Obama's firm rejection of the House GOP offer forced the dark lord out of his crypt and into the open, and everyone in DC saw him for what he is:  a maniacal power hungry nihilist who values leverage above all and would rather see the country default than to hand a victory of any kind to Democrats.  This man is a sociopath and must be stopped.  
Ryan seems, in my view, concerned that Boehner might bring up a Senate passed bill and let it pass in the House with Democratic votes.  That's why he was so angry and boisterous in the House meeting.  He wants to whip the GOP House to unite behind him, which is a road to nowhere.  Ryan has made it clear that he will deny Boehner a majority of GOP votes.  The tea party will be aligned with Ryan on this particular vote.  Boehner controls at most only 20-25 votes.  Ultimately this is all about Boehner.  If he does undercut Ryan, he can say that he is acting for the good of the country and the survival of his party.  That will open him up to recriminations within the GOP and their media and perhaps a leadership challenge.  
The Democrats will be on solid political ground to pass the bill they want in the Senate and then force the House to deal with the issue and absorb most of the blame should they fail to act to avoid a default.  This requires Democrats to be unafraid of the GOP taking the country into default if Ryan has his way.  Democrats cannot save the GOP from itself, even if not stepping in results in a default because of the GOP's inability to govern.
For his part, President Obama will need to resist the temptation to offer anything of substance to the GOP. Boehner will come calling again, but he cannot deliver anything approaching a majority of the GOP caucus so he should be ignored.  Boehner simply has to be told to let whatever bill comes out of the Senate have a floor vote.
The risk of default remains high mainly because of Paul Ryan's unwillingness to let go of hostages and the tactic of hostage taking.  However, with many GOPers seeing the writing on the wall, the Democrats have an equally reasonable chance to impose their will and obtain the right result.  Stay tuned.

636,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/02/25/1189635/-Eric-Cantor-will-propose-Federal-Law-that-Ends-Overtime-Pay-for-hourly-workers,News,Dailykos,Democrat,Eric Cantor will propose Federal Law that Ends Overtime Pay for hourly workers,"

     In Eric Cantor's February 2013 speech, he said he wanted to propose Federal Law that would end overtime pay for hourly workers.  Currently, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, mandates that certain workers get paid ""time + 1/2"" for overtime work.  Eric Cantor wants to eliminate that law.  Because -- ya know -- workers not getting paid for overtime hours worked out so good for workers before FDR enacted that Law.
     Eric Cantor's ""end of overtime pay for workers"" that he talked about in his February speech was overshadowed, in part, by the public whining Cantor did bitching that 'Obama gave his speech at the same time as me ... wah, wah, wah.'
     In this week's New Yorker Magazine, Ryan Lizza wrote an excellent article titled: ""Can Eric Cantor, the Republican Majority Leader, redeem his party and himself?"" in which Lizza reminded readers that Eric Cantor wants to end the Federal law that mandates certain workers get paid overtime for the extra hours they labor.
From the New Yorker Magazine: (page 12)
Can Eric Cantor, the Republican Majority Leader, redeem his party and himself? (page 13)
Cantor spoke about school choice, tax reform, expanding visas. After the speech, he rode back to the Capitol and met privately with House Republicans to discuss one of the policies he had emphasized: a policy that would allow workers to convert overtime compensation into time off. “I gave a talk today about helping people and about finally focussing on legislation that has understandable benefits right away,” Cantor said. He explained that it would help parents who wanted to go on a field trip or attend a teacher conference. “What I want to see is how we can communicate this, communicate the benefit. How are we going to build a coalition and get it done?”

First, the Republicans tried to do this very same thing in 2003 in a House Bill: HR 1119 ""Family Time Flexibility Act"" (isn't that a cute title for a bill that will end overtime pay for hourly working moms and dads)



     In 2003, when the Republicans tried to end the requirement that hourly workers get paid overtime, they tried to sell it in good-old fashioned GOP Propaganda Minster: Frank Luntz terms.  They used words like ""Family Flex time"" ... and ... ""work longer hours so you can have half a day with your family, maybe""
     Cantor's goal in allowing the interview with the New Yorker Magazine, was to re-market the GOP draconian policies.
    Since the 2012 elections, the Republicans have been divided between those who believe their policies are the problem and those who believe they just need better marketing—between those who believe they need to make better pizza and those who think they just need a more attractive box. Cantor, who is known among his colleagues as someone with strategic intelligence and a knack for political positioning, argues that it’s the box.
Cantor was happy to make himself available for several long interviews. He persistently struck a diplomatic note and mentioned again and again how much he looked forward to working with Obama, a position that he said he’s been articulating for a long time.
“Why isn’t that your reputation, then?” I asked.
“I have to ask you that. Maybe you can make it so!”

    No, Eric, it is not the ""box"" -- it is the policies.
    The article reminded the readers about the time in December when Cantor, Boehner and the House GOP tried, but failed, to pass more spending cuts.  As a reminder, Cantor thought he had the votes to pass a Bill requiring more spending cuts but he did not and Boehner and Cantor ended up with egg on their face.  Cantor was especially pissed off because the failure to pass the GOP Bill meant Cantor would not be able to go on his ""family vacation""
House Republicans had to decide what to do with it. If Cantor had had his way, he would have been in Guadeloupe. “My whole family went on a cruise, and I couldn’t go,” he told me, glumly; he had to stay in Washington to deal with the fiscal-cliff crisis. His wife, Diana, said, “This was our twenty-third anniversary, and he missed my fiftieth-birthday cruise also.” 
[wah, wah, wah]

    Isn't that sad.  Poor Eric Cantor could not go on his family vacation because he screwed up in doing his job so he had to stay to clean up the mess he and his GOP brethren made.
.... Meanwhile, Eric Cantor wants to pass a Federal Law to eliminate overtime pay but not overtime labor. Meaning, naturally, that the law Eric Cantor wants to propose will mean that millions of hourly workers in America would a) not be able to afford their family vacation, and b) might have to work overtime during a scheduled family vacation all without extra pay.
     Since Eric Cantor has not given anyone in the media a copy of his proposed Bill, all we can do is look back at the 2003 Republican Bill that would end the Federal Law requiring workers get actual money in exchange for extra hours worked.
     One of the many problems with the 2003 Bill was that the Bill did not actually ""require"" employers to give their hourly workers the ""family flex time"" when the worker wanted to use it:
Requires the employer to permit use of comp-time accrued under such an option program within a reasonable time after the employee's request if such use does not unduly disrupt the employer's operations.
    Also, Under H.R. 1119, employees who work overtime hours in a given week might not receive any pay or time off for that work until more than a year later, at the employer’s discretion.
     Therefore, without receiving any interest or security, the employees, in essence, give their overtime pay to the employer in the hopes of getting it back some time later as paid time off.
      Hourly worker's overtime pay was put at risk of loss in the event of business failure and closure, bankruptcy, or fraud.  In short, H.R.1119 was nothing more than a scheme to allow employers to avoid paying for overtime, a scheme that would result in longer hours, lower incomes, and less predictable workweeks for hourly workers.
    From Eric Cantor's February speech, his words sounded a lot like the ""marketing"" used in 2003 where the GOP tried to pass off the notion that not getting actual money paid for overtime worked was a great thing because if workers work overtime they'll have more time to spend with their family.
Eric Cantor Speech dated February, 2013
     ""Federal laws dating back to the 1930s make it harder for parents who hold hourly jobs to balance the demands of work and home. An hourly employee cannot convert previous overtime into future comp-time or flex-time. In 1985, Congress passed a law that gave state and municipal employees this flexibility, but today still denies that same privilege to the entire private sector. That’s not right.
     ""There’s a police officer at home in my district, her name is Vicki. She is working a tough job, with long hours, while raising her children. Her life is made a little easier because as a local government employee, she is permitted to work some extra hours and save it up for a sick day or a school event.
     ""Imagine if we simply chose to give all employees and employers this option. A working mom could work overtime this month and use it as time off next month without having to worry about whether she’ll be able to take home enough money to pay the rent. This is the kind of common sense legislation that should be non-controversial and moves us in the right direction to help make life work for families.""

    Cantor seems very giddy and excited that Vicki gets to work overtime in order to 'save it up for a sick day' ...
     Two things wrong with Cantor's last paragraph, 1) the mom would feel a lot better about her income if she were PAID OVERTIME for all the extra hours she worked; and 2) the 2003 GOP Bill did not guarantee the worker would get time off when the worker wanted it.
      In Cantor's defense, I don't know if Cantor's Bill will be different from the 2003 Bill whereby the time off of the worker asked for was restricted by the employer to a degree that the worker might not get their time off until 12 months after they worked extra hours ... and even after 12 months there was no guarantee the worker would get their requested time off.
     However, in Cantor's speech, he did not say Vicky got to use her extra hours worked as time off with pay the next month, Cantor said she had to work extra hours and, ""save it up for a sick day or a school event.""   Therefore, it is likely that Cantor's Bill could very much look like the 2003 Republican Bill.
     After his speech in February, he met privately with Republicans (as described above the orange squiggle) where Cantor asked if they were finished drafting the 'end overtime pay for hourly worker's' proposal:
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, excused herself halfway through the session and left; the meeting seemed to have been convened mostly for the edification of the one reporter in the room. Cantor asked Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican leader, if the legislation was ready yet. “We’re still kind of in the exploratory stage, but we are looking at some child-care bills, and not quite ready at this point to bring them forward,” she said. “But we’re working on it.""
“O.K., I get it,” Cantor said. “There’s always . . .” His voice trailed off. “O.K., anybody else have anything?” The room went silent. “All right, thank you. Thank you very much.”

It's the GOP Policies, not the box.
     The article went on to explain the additional massive cuts the Republicans were demanding in exchange for the 'debt ceiling' vote.  
Cantor explained why he argued at the retreat against using the debt ceiling as political leverage. He had been hearing from donors on Wall Street and in the business community about the potential impact on the markets.
The legislation merely delayed the fight over the debt ceiling until mid-May. In its place, Cantor and the House Republicans had engineered the battle over the sequester, which would begin on March 1st. Cantor viewed the various fiscal deadlines as what his aides referred to as hot stoves. “One is particularly hot,” Steve Stombres, Cantor’s chief of staff, said. “You touch the debt limit and you go into default, and that could be irreparable damage to our economy. But we felt like we could handle the heat of the sequester. We just needed to get them sequenced correctly and use that as an opportunity. The sequester was in place, and the members don’t want to give up that money, those cuts.”

hmmm ... was that a slip of the tongue when Cantor's aid said ""the members don’t want to give up that money"" ... was he referring to the money from the Wall Street donors who told Cantor not to f'ck with the Debt Ceiling vote?  
    In the article, Eric Cantor insists that the American voters don't reject Republican draconian policies that are geared to benefit the ultra-wealthy - Cantor thinks the American voters agree with Republicans:
* that ultra-wealthy people should get workers to work overtime with no extra pay and
* that the ultra-wealthy should be able to hide their income overseas to avoid paying taxes that would otherwise pay for things like our debt on two wars and
* that Americans do want cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaide, Food Stamps, education, infrastructure spending ... all so the ultra-wealthy can pay anywhere from 0%-14% income tax rate.
     Eric Cantor believes that all the Republicans need to do is market those policies, that would roll America back to the era of the failed ""Gilded Age"" in a prettier box.  
UPDATE:  
The 1985 Law that Cantor referenced in his February 2013 speech, talks about is the 1985 Amendment to the FLSA 1938 Act which says state and local government employers to compensate their worker's overtime hours with paid time away from work in lieu of overtime pay. There is a cap on the amount of overtime hours a state/city worker must work before they are even allowed to possibly get paid overtime in money form: 150 hours for non-emergency workers and 500 hours for emergency workers such as the police.
The 1985 amendments were enacted to protect state and local governments from the financial burden that the requirement to provide overtime pay would have posed.  
Therefore, since the 1985 law is cited in Cantor's speech, there is no reason to think that any legislation coming from Cantor would allow the worker to have an option of getting paid overtime or taking time off.  In fact, we have every reason to think that Cantor's legislation would allow employers to deny worker's the option, just like the 1985 law denies state worker's the option.
It would appear, that Cantor is wanting to enact his 'no overtime pay for hourly workers' in the private sector Bill so as to protect private sector from the financial burden that the requirement to provide overtime pay poses.  
In short, as the poster ""Inland"" put it:
""It's not meant to be an expansion of choice for employees.  It's meant to end hours and wage legislation from the New Deal.""

637,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/20/1210395/-Meet-the-Republican-who-is-demanding-that-the-government-let-poor-people-starve,News,Dailykos,Democrat,Meet the Republican who is demanding that the government let poor people starve,"












Stephen Fincher, a deranged Republican congressman from Tennessee, is very angry that the federal government is committed to preventing poor people from starving to death:

Republican Congressman Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, who supports cuts to the program, had his own Bible verse from the Book of Thessalonians to quote back to Vargas: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat,” he said.

The program in question is SNAP, better known as food stamps. Fincher and his ultra-right-wing friends in the House are furious about the fact that the worst economic crisis in 80 years has resulted in more Americans needing food stamps. The whole point of programs like SNAP and other automatic stabilizers, of course, is that they kick in when the economy is struggling and people need help. Fincher is shocked and horrified by this heinous policy of ensuring that poor people and their children don't starve. Food is to be earned! Sure, this is the richest country in the history in the world, but if we provide our citizens with food to eat, then freedom is obviously dead.

He fulminates about people who are allegedly ""unwilling to work"" sucking off the government teat with impunity. This is a patently dishonest representation of the SNAP program. Most people who receive food stamps cannot be dismissed as losers who are ""unwilling to work."" Nearly half (47%) of all food stamp recipients are children. Another 8% are 60 years of age or older. The ""working poor"" - people who live in a household with income from work - represent another 41%. Between children, the elderly, the working poor, and people who want a job but cannot find one - someone should tell Fincher that there are still more than 3 unemployed job seekers for every 1 opening - that leaves very few people who can be accurately described as being ""unwilling"" to work. It's also worth noting that the average monthly SNAP benefit is a whopping $287. It takes a deeply disturbed person to crusade against providing this class of people with food to eat, when the economy is this battered, and when the broad economic benefits of the program have been so well established (at least in the reality-based community). 

Now, this would not normally be worthy of mention. Hardly a day goes by without some Republican sadist expressing fury that poor people have it so good. Devising new ways to make the peasants suffer is what makes Republicans wake up in the morning. What's fascinating about this particular case, though, is Fincher's background. 

The reason this is even more egregious than the usual Republican class warfare is that Fincher himself is a poster boy for government dependency. It's not just that he's benefited here and there from some government help. That sort of low-level hypocrisy is almost to be expected from these types. But Fincher has received millions - $3.2 million as of June 2010 - in federal crop subsidies. The people who refer to themselves as Tea Partiers threatened to derail his candidacy over this, but then they realized that they have no principles, and supported him anyway. He's now a member of the ""Tea Party Caucus,"" which, amazingly, is something that actually exists. Fincher's brother and father also snatched another $6.7 million in subsidies as Stephen geared up to run for Congress on a platform of eliminating ""wasteful government spending."" The ""wasteful spending"" that he had in mind, of course, was that which serves policy aims with which he disagrees, such as keeping poor people alive. 

House Republicans are on a mission to slash the SNAP program by $20 billion over the next decade. A Senate committee, just last week, voted to cut it by ""only"" $4 billion. If some sort of vicious ""compromise"" is reached between the sociopaths in the House who are demanding human sacrifice on a massive scale, and the ""moderates"" in the Senate who are only comfortable with letting some people starve, it will not be pretty. This is not hyperbole, either. SNAP really does keep poor people, including millions of children, from going hungry, and it's under attack from ultra-right-wing ideologues. This program deserves the support and activism of progressives as much as any government program in existence.

Last night, Jon Stewart mocked the shit out of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) for his all-night non-filibuster, and how he read from Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" and seemed to miss the entire point of the story.
We've already wasted too much time.  We have to get right down to the Senate floor.  Texas Republican Ted Cruz has been addressing that august body with great urgency.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I rise today in an effort to speak for 26 million Texans, and for 300 million Americans. ... And as Americans, we value liberty and opportunity above all else. ... What the American people are interested in is what we've always been interested in.
Stuffed crust pizza.  No, wait.  Tacos made from Doritos.  No!  Frappucino!  Brangelina!  Frappalina!  Bran-ge....
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): ... what we've always been interested in.  Which is freedom.
Did not see that coming.  Does that freedom have cheese stuffed in its crust?  Well clearly, Senator Cruz believes our freedom is under assault.  Senator Cruz, would you care to offer a historical precedent that you feel is appropriate to the threat that we now face?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): You go to the 1940s.  Nazi Germany.
Nazi Germany?!?  Why, that's my least favorite kind of Germany!  You got you regular Germany, your Weimar Germany, your Visigoths, your Hasselhoffs, but oh my God, Ted Cruz says we're at Defcon Nazi!
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Look, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, accept the Nazis.  Yes, they'll dominate the continent of Europe.  But that's not our problem.  Let's appease them. ... And in America, there were voices that listened to that.  I suspect those same pundits who say it can't be done, if it had been in the 1940s, we would've been listening to them.
Let's not listen to them!  I don't wanna listen to the Nazi appeasers!  What is this ""it"" that these Hitler-lovers believe we can't do, but that you say we should be doing to save our stuffed crust freedom?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I rise today in opposition...
I rise with you!  To defeat what I can only assume is the zombie apocalypse, which is clearly the only thing you could be talking about, given the level of rhetoric you have used thus far.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): ... in opposition to Obamacare.
(audience groaning laughter)
OK, OK, possibly a very troubled bureaucratic system.  Can we focus on the Nazi zombies for a second?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand.
What?!  Well, that's easy for you to take that kind of physical risk — you've got government health care.  (wild audience cheering and applause)
So you'd be unable to stand.  ""Until the Nazis steal my knees.""
Yes, that's Ted Cruz, the Senator who, starting yesterday at 2:41 Eastern Wasting Time, took to the Senate floor for 21 hours, not to filibuster, not to delay, but to cast himself as Churchill to Obama's Chamberlain in the great fight against... Hitler's... health care exchanges.  I lost the thread of the metaphor.  But my point is this.

(audience laughter)
Yeah, it takes a while to sink in.  It takes a while to sink in.
Senator Cruz clearly believes our very freedom is at stake here.  And Senator Cruz — as a brilliant Harvard educated lawyer and Princeton debate champion — I imagine that he is prepared to make a stunning and sophisticated argument as to why Obamacare places this very nation in such peril.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Some time ago, I tweeted a speech that Ashton Kutcher gave.  That's a terrific speech.
(shocked audience laughter)
You're fucking with us, right?
""I tweeted a speech by Ashton Kutcher.  It was so good, I only needed 140 characters of it.""
Wow, how would something like that look in the Senator's original analogy?

Ted Cruz, Senator!  You are one of the great minds of our times — says you — who says we are facing one of the great perils of our age.  And yet you've outsourced your argument and wisdom to a dude who cannot find his car?  Perhaps there was even more eloquent and soaring speech-making to come.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): I want to point out just a few words of wisdom from Duck Dynasty. ... There was a movie, Jason vs. Freddy, I forget, they fought each other, I forget what even happened in that movie. ... Eight White Castle restaurants a year, I like their little burgers. ... It's a little bit like the World Wrestling Federation. ... In my mind, I heard the music from The Shining, er, not The Shining, from Psycho. ... Just like in Star Wars movies ... (in bad Darth Vader voice)  Mike Lee, I am your father.
(wild audience laughter)
(whispers to Cruz) You're losing them.
Come on, Senator Cruz, this isn't even a filibuster!  You had 20 hours to make your case.  You're double Ivy League!  Surely you can do better, maybe cite a study or a book.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Dr. Seuss's ""Green Eggs and Ham"" ... ""I do not like them, Sam I am, I do not like green eggs and ham"".
(audience laughter as Jon facepalms)
So to express your opposition to Obamacare, you go with a book about a stubborn jerk who decides he hates something before he's tried it.  (wild audience cheering and applause)  And when he finally does get a taste, he has to admit after tasting it, ""This is pretty fucking good"".
Senator Cruz, you're trying to save America!  Get to the dire foundational issue at hand.
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): You like your doctor?  Do you want to keep seeing your doctor?  Well, I'll tell ya, Americans all over this country are losing their health care because of Obamacare.  They're losing their ability to see their doctors.  That's what happens if the Senate doesn't act to defund Obamacare.
OK, maybe that's what happens under Obamacare.  As opposed to our current health care utopia where doctor and patient mate for life?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): One half of small businesses say that they will either cut hours to reduce full-time employees, or full-time employees with part-time workers to avoid the mandate. ... Obamacare is estimated to have increased individual health insurance premiums by anywhere from 64% to 146%.
Look, I'm not saying Obamacare is perfect.  It's not, it was designed by Congress, and nothing designed by Congress is perfect.  You ask them to design a puppy, you'd get something with no face, two assholes, and a semi-automatic machine gun for a tail.  That's fine.

(audience laughter)
Take that down, that's really disturbing.  (picture of Cruz reappears)  Not much better.
Do you have a more foundational critique?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country. ... Small businesses have been hammered under Obamacare unlike ever before. ... It's shattering the economy, all across the country in all 50 states.
Now as of now, I'm unaware of the specific impact on growth and jobs Obamacare has had given that the sign-up for it doesn't even start until next week.  But clearly, economic growth is an important issue.  And so important to you, that just the possibility that Obamacare may be hurting the economy is enough to get you on your feet for 21 hours.  I congratulate you on that, sir.
But... I can think of another thing that came out of Washington recently that is hurting economic growth right now.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the spending cuts from the sequester are costing the country three-quarters of a million jobs this year alone.  How did you feel about those cuts?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (3/16/2013): We stood our ground and finally got at least the first small step — and I underscore it is a small step — to reigning in our uncontrollable spending and debt.
Ahhhh!  So that slowdown for economic growth is good.  You know who else thought reigning in uncontrollable spending and debt was a good idea?  Hitler.  (audience laughter)
So your problem with the sequester is that it didn't cost us enough jobs.  For all its flaws, Obamacare appears to at least be attempting to fix some fundamental holes in our health care system, like insurance companies being able to deny based on pre-existing conditions.  So if you're going to repeal it, you'd better have some idea of your own on how to do that.  Pre-existing conditions, how would you do that?
SEN. TED CRUZ, R-TX (9/24/2013): My view on pre-existing conditions is we ought to reform the market to deal with that problem.
(sad audience laughter)
So you got nothing.  You know what, Ted Cruz?  The level of threat you say we face from Obamacare isn't met by the quality of solutions and the rhetoric that you offer.
You know, reminds me of a character I once read about, by I believe one of your favorite authors, Dr. Seuss and his beloved children's book, ""The Bore-ax"".  (audience laughter)

Join me now as I read one of my favorite sections.  (wild audience cheering as Jon takes out the book)
In the land of D.C., in the Senate of Snooze,
Lived the showboatiest Blab whose name was Ted Cruz.
Ted talked about health care, compared it to Nazis.
As comparisons so, he was off by a lotsy.
Health care, he said, would end this great nation.
A point made after hours of mouth masturbation.
Repeal it, defund it, erase it, deny it,
Murder it, skullfuck it, bread and deep fry it!

That's weird, for a children's book author.
Cruz claimed freedom and liberty, but it was all a big show.
Because he could have spent all that time making sure the law didn't blow.
We'll be right back.
Video below the fold.



















Meanwhile, Stephen also briefly talked about Ted Cruz's non-filibuster.








He also looked at Google's new policy for YouTube comments, and talked sports and chess with Floyd Mayweather.
















Stephen had on Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Jon had on the new band Atoms for Peace, who performed ""Default"" and ""Harrowdown Hill"".

...and then, get this, I told them how to avoid poverty.



...and then, get this, I told them how to avoid poverty.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) recently attended a Rotary Club meeting in my hometown of Madison, Wisconsin. During this meeting he spoke on several topics, but what was most notable were his comments about poverty and how to avoid it:
[T]hose who want to stay out of poverty have the best chances of doing so if they graduate from high school, don’t get addicted to drugs and alcohol and don’t get pregnant out of wedlock.
Keep in mind this is coming from a man whose net worth is well over $23 Million so he really knows what he is talking about. Of course as a guy who has lived paycheck to paycheck I have some advice I would like to add to Sen. Johnson’s on how to avoid poverty.

Choose your parents well. Almost half (49 percent) of children who are born into poverty are persistently poor.
Don’t let your parents get divorced. If they do get divorced, statistically speaking, you are better off living with dad, not mom.
Don’t lose your job.
Only bad workers make minimum wage, so don’t be a bad worker.
Don’t get a major illness.
Don’t be a minority.
If you chose your parents well you can borrow money from them to start your own business.
Don’t be junior enlisted in the military and have a family.
Marry well. It worked for Sen. Johnson.

Sen. Johnson giving advice about how to avoid poverty is about as useless as a parka and electric socks at Lambeau Field on the 4th of July. He has no idea of how it feels to have a job yet you still have to lurch from paycheck to paycheck. What it is like to eat ramen noodles for weeks on end because you don’t have the money to go grocery shopping. He has no idea of what it is like knowing you will be homeless if you miss just one paycheck.
It must be nice to live such a simple life like Sen. Johnson. A life where the solution to avoiding poverty is pretty much, don’t fuck up, ever. Too bad it isn’t that simple in the real world where you can do everything right and still struggle just because of who your parents were or because of random chance.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's ""pride and glory"", the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, is filing for bankruptcy. Revel Casino, a private corporation,  was heavily subsidized by taxpayers whose investment of hundreds of millions of dollars is now lost.

LITTLE FERRY, N.J. (CBSNewYork/AP) - Less than a year after opening, the Revel casino and hotel in Atlantic City has announced it is filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy next month.
Revel, the struggling city's newest casino and a $2.4 billion project, announced Tuesday that it would enter a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy and remain open after a rough start during its first year in business.
Once hailed as a game-changing resort that could pull Atlantic City back from the brink, the casino has not been able to turn a profit and has been eclipsed by competitors in the city and in neighboring states.
Through the bankruptcy process, Revel plans to convert $1.5 billion in debt into $1 billion in equity for its creditors — effectively giving them ownership of the casino
instead of repaying the money.

This was Chris Christie's baby:
The continuation of the abandoned investment was the brainchild, and pride and glory of one Chris Christie who then said ""the $2.4 billion Revel is one of the most spectacular resorts he's ever seen and expects it will motivate other Atlantic City casinos to revitalize their properties. ""I think that one of the things that Revel will be is a catalyst for additional modernization and investment by the other casinos to say, listen, if we grow more people here coming to the region and we're offering something that looks nice further down the boardwalk, maybe people will want to look there as well."" As it now stands, the Revel will only be a catalyst for further bankruptcies as industry after industry finds out what a tapped out consumer with no access to $1.8 trillion in excess reserves truly means.
One of the most unflattering reports on this story comes from Breitbart of all places:
Even after Morgan Stanley ""abandoned the project before construction was complete and wrote down nearly its entire $1.25 billion investment"" in 2011, Christie decided to invest taxpayer dollars into the casino, saying if the casino succeeded, it would be a sign that ""Atlantic City is back.""
According to an April 2012 report, Christie gambled on the casino, backing ""the stalled construction of Revel with $261.4 million in state tax credits over the next 20 years,"" even as mayors saw some red flags. In addition, Christie also ""approved $2.6 million in employee-training grants for the casino,"" which was ""on top of additional millions previously pledged through local tax breaks and $20 million in infrastructure funding from the state’s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.""

Christie of course tried to put the best possible spin on this by saying:
“[The lenders are] showing their faith and confidence in the concept and in the future of Atlantic City by not walking away and closing the place down, but by, in fact, saying ‘We’re going to take the money that we’re owed and instead we’ll take stock in the company,” Christie said.
On the other hand, they had no other choice and would have been stuck with a giant white elephant.



The gambling industry and Atlantic City are not in good health. The Trump Plaza casino in Atlantic City recently sold for $20 MM - today it would cost $400 MM to build, so it has lost 95% of its value. The Sands and Atlantis casinos have disappeared. Yet Christie thought this project was a good investment of taxpayers' $260MM which is now essentially down the drain.

As early as last September an article by David Cay Johnston appeared in Reuters describing the troubles the Atlantic City gambling industry was facing so it should come as no surprise that the casino is now declaring bankruptcy
Because betting is now legal in neighboring states, gambling here is way down. The casino hotels have slashed their workforces, cut real wages and, citing falling property values, received huge property tax refunds - with more refunds likely.
The city has sold $103 million of bonds to finance casino property tax refunds, bonds that with interest will cost the average homeowner more than $2,100 over the next two decades, Michael Stinson, the city finance director, said.

But Gov. Christie likes to brag in his ads and speeches that he has lowered New Jerseyan's property taxes.
According to Johnston, Atlantic City has imposed a tax on its residents to subsidize the casinos - $100 mm over next 15 years.  The casinos cannot operate without government subsidies and have become ""welfare queens"". This is an ironic reversal of what was supposed to produce jobs and income for residents, who now instead have to support the industry with their tax dollars.
According to Johnston, Chris Christie is a leading proponent of corporate socialism - taking from the many and giving to business owners.  Massive gifts to corporations entice them to relocate to New Jersey. For example, these corporations get to collect state income tax from workers' paychecks, but do not have to actually pay it to the state. They pocket the state income tax.
The city is about to sell another $35 million in bonds, while the Press of Atlantic City reports that $40 million more may have to be borrowed next year. If all that happens the average homeowner eventually may be out more than $3,600 in added taxes.
That may well understate the added costs to local taxpayers in the next few years as the gambling business is likely to shrink even more, as Mayor Lorenzo Langford told me. Each time another casino opens in nearby states, ""the Atlantic City market should expect to see some lost business,"" Mayor Langford said, and ""one or more of the weaker casinos may close.""

SOLYNDRA
Of course what this brings to mind is the endless whining by Republicans about Solyndra.  who liked to repeat that the government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers. Which is of course ridiculous on its face as the government has always been instrumental in shaping policy and the economy. And Solyndra will have cost taxpayers far less than Revel and is a far more ethical and beneficial use of monies as it could have reduced the effects of climate change, whereas gambling robs from the poor to give to the rich.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney)
To Democrats it represents government support for a private enterprise that was supposed to create something that made us all better off -- clean energy and jobs.
To Republicans it represents government overstepping its role.
With the issue not showing signs of fading away in the election, here are seven things you should know about Solyndra and the Department of Energy loan program that supported it.
It was started by Bush: The DOE loan program that funded Solyndra was actually started by President Bush in 2005. It was intended to provide government support for ""innovative technologies.""
Lawmakers set aside $10 billion to cover any losses from $26 billion in loans. Solyndra could potentially cost the government $529 million.
And Beacon, a power storage company that also went bankrupt, cost the government $12 million. So even if Solyndra ends up costing the full $529 million, there's still nearly $9.5 billion available should other loans go belly up.
Solyndra wanted more: The company applied for another $468 million in funding shortly after its first DOE loan closed. The government did not award the second request.


ARC TUNNEL
And of course the final reminder is Christie's cancellation of what was at the time the country's largest public works project, on the grounds that taxpayers couldn't afford it. But, according to him they can afford to subsidize a private project.
The Tunnel would have created jobs in the region, but Christie chose to throw good money after bad in Atlantic City. Furthermore his reasons for doing so have now been refuted in a subsequent GAO report.
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey exaggerated when he declared that unforeseen costs to the state were forcing him to cancel the new train tunnel planned to relieve congested routes across the Hudson River, according to a long-awaited report by independent Congressional investigators.
The report [...] found that while Mr. Christie said that state transportation officials had revised cost estimates for the tunnel to at least $11 billion and potentially more than $14 billion, the range of estimates had in fact remained unchanged in the two years before he announced in 2010 that he was shutting down the project. And state transportation officials, the report says, had said the cost would be no more than $10 billion.
Mr. Christie also misstated New Jersey’s share of the costs: he said the state would pay 70 percent of the project; the report found that New Jersey was paying 14.4 percent.
Canceling the tunnel, then the largest public works project in the nation, helped shape Mr. Christie’s profile as a rising Republican star, an enforcer of fiscal discipline in a country drunk on debt. But the report is likely to revive criticism that his decision, which he said was about “hard choices” in tough economic times, was more about avoiding the need to raise the state’s gasoline tax, which would have violated a campaign promise. The governor subsequently steered $4 billion earmarked for the tunnel to the state’s near-bankrupt transportation trust fund, traditionally financed by the gasoline tax.

If there's any doubt that Christie is a typical Republican let's hope this debacle puts it to rest. He is on the forefront of corporate socialism - giving from the many to give to the (well connected) few.

Today's Republican Party, with its Ted Cruzes, Rand Pauls, Richard Murdocks and Todd Akins, certainly brings new meaning to the saying ""bat shit crazy"". Today's Republican Party. with its Mitch McConnells, John Boehners, Lindsey Grahams, and Darrel Isas, certainly brings new meaning to the saying ""dirty, no-good, rotten old sonuvabitches"". But not so long along - actually within my lifetime - there was a very good and decent Republican. Actually, a great Republican, and he was even a Republican President. He was this guy:



Dwight David “Ike” Eisenhower came from a family of immigrants, and like so many immigrants worked their way up from dirt poor to middle class through hard work. The Eisenhauer (German for “iron hewer”) family migrated from Germany. The Eisenhower family settled in York, Pennsylvania, in 1730, and in the 1880s they moved to Kansas. At some point the German name Eisenhauer was changed to a more American spelling of Eisenhower. Dwight’s father, David Jacob Eisenhower, was a college educated engineer. Eisenhower’s mother, Ida Elizabeth Stover, born in Virginia of German Lutheran ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. She met David Eisenhower when they were both attending college, and they married in September 1885. David owned a general store in Hope, Kansas, but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished. The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 to their name. David worked as a mechanic with a railroad and then with a creamery. By 1898, the family was self-sustaining with suitable accommodations for their large family, and set about on doing just that. Eisenhower was born on October 14, 1890, the third of seven boys. All of the boys were called “Ike”, such as “Big Ike” (Edgar) and “Little Ike” (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name. As a child, Dwight was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother an eye; he later referred to this as an experience teaching him the need to be protective of those under him. Dwight attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909. He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college, though they lacked the funds. They agreed to take alternate years at college while the other worked, in order to earn the tuitions. Edgar went to college first while Dwight was worked as a night supervisor at a creamery. At the end of the year Edgar pleaded for a second year in college as he was enjoying it so much, and Dwight deferred to his brother and continued working.  During that second year a friend was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school, since no tuition was required. Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S. Senator, Joseph L. Bristow. Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition, he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy. He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911. At West Point Dwight as at best an average student, and graduated in the middle of the class of 1915. Dwight was first stationed in Texas, and it was there that me met and fell in love with  Mamie Geneva Doud, his beloved “Mamie”. He proposed to her on Valentine’s Day in 1916, and they were married on July 1 of that year, and remained married for the next 53 years, until Dwight’s death in 1969. Dwight had a very successful military career, continually promoted to higher and higher positions. In December 1943, President Roosevelt appointed Eisenhower  Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force. Eisenhower planned and led the famous D-Day Invasion of Normandy, and the subsequent operations that led to the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany less than one year later.
General Eisenhower was immensely popular for his successes in WWII, and As the 1948 election approached, Eisenhower was repeatedly urged by both the Democrats and Republicans to run for president. President Truman even offering to serve as his Vice-President if he would agree to run as president on the Democratic ticket. Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. He firmly declined all the offers and many believed he was foregoing his only opportunity to be president –  Thomas E. Dewey was considered the probable winner, would presumably serve two terms, and Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would then be too old. Despite a certain Chicago newspaper headline proclaiming otherwise, Truman defeated Dewy. In 1951 President Truman again pressed Eisenhower to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disdain for the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A “Draft Eisenhower” movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert Taft, who he narrowly defeated for the Republican nomination. Eisenhower ran a strong campaign and defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide, the first Republican elected President in 20 years. He also managed to bring with a Republican majority in Congress, also the first time in 20 years. Eisenhower’s campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, “I Like Ike”.

Eisenhower was reelected in 1956, defeating Stevenson a second time, in an even greater landslide. Throughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of a moderate, progressive Republicanism:  He said: “I have just one purpose … and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, they are going to get it … before I end up, either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won’t be with them anymore.” He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation and expanded  Social Security programs and rolled them into a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. While President Truman had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces in 1948, actual implementation had been slow. Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union message in February 1953, saying “I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces“. When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through. The day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools were unconstitutional, Eisenhower told District of Columbia officials to make Washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children. He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 and signed those acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights. In 1957, the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the Brown decision. Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order. When Faubus balked, the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division. They escorted and protected nine black students’ entry to Little Rock Central High School, an all-white public school, for the first time since the Reconstruction era.

We baby boomers look back at the Eisenhower years as a period of peace and prosperity, with strong economic growth and an ever increasing middle class. It was the time when television took it’s place in the American home, and families would gather round to watch shows like Leave it to Beaver, Ozzie and Harriet, The Honeymooners and I Love Lucy. It was Eisenhower who nominated Earl Warren as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, leading the “Warren Court” to make so many decisions that led to much greater equality and justice in our country: Brown v. Board of Education, that banned racial segregation of public schools. Gideon v. Wainwright, which that all criminal defendants receive publicly funded defense counsel if they could not afford one themselves. Miranda v. Arizona, which led to the “Miranda Warning”, that everyone charged with a crime must be advised of his rights to remain silent until he has been advised by an attorney. And two of Eisenhower’s greatest legislative achievements still foster and promote economic growth today. In cooperation with Canada, we built the St. Lawrence Seaway, a series of canals and channels that connected all the Great Lakes to the St. Lawrence River, opening up ports deep in our Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean. And it was Eisenhower who pushed through and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956. He managed to overcome opposition claiming the project was “too expensive” and that we “couldn’t afford it” (sound familiar?) by promoting it as essential to American security during the Cold War. It was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war, hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers. But he also believed an interstate highway system would lead to greater economic growth, and he was right.
Although known for, and probably elected President, as a great military leader, Eisenhower knew first hand the horrors of war and deftly kept us out of war. And it was Dwight Eisenhower who first warned us of the dangers of the Military-Industrial Complex:
“In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.""

On Fox News Sunday this morning former Senator and Republican Presidential Candidate Bob Dole said that he didn’t think he could make it in today’s Republican Party, and he didn’t think Ronald Reagan or Richard Nixon could either. I thinks he’s right, and would certainly add Dwight D. Eisenhower to the list. Dwight D. Eisenhower was a thoughtful man, a decent man, a man of principle, a man committed to doing what was right - right for the country, right for it's people, not what's just best for his own political party. And people like that need not apply to today's Republican Party.
But, I'll leave it at that. Memorial Day should not be a day for partisan politics. It is a day to honor people like Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Greatest Generation would saved us from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. It is day to honor the millions of brave men and women who serve and served with honor, distinction, and bravery wearing the uniform of our great nation. All gave some, and some gave all. God bless them, God bless their families. And may God bless every one else in this world, bless them and get them to see that war and violence should have no place in this world. More than enough have died, more than enough have suffered.

Believing they are losing the messaging war with progressives, a group of prominent conservatives in Washington—including the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and journalists from Breitbart News and the Washington Examiner—has been meeting privately since early this year to concoct talking points, coordinate messaging, and hatch plans for ""a 30 front war seeking to fundamentally transform the nation,"" according to documents obtained by Mother Jones.

Dubbed Groundswell, this coalition convenes weekly in the offices of Judicial Watch, the conservative legal watchdog group. During these hush-hush sessions and through a Google group, the members of Groundswell—including aides to congressional Republicans—cook up battle plans for their ongoing fights against the Obama administration, congressional Democrats, progressive outfits, and the Republican establishment and ""clueless"" GOP congressional leaders. They devise strategies for killing immigration reform, hyping the Benghazi controversy, and countering the impression that the GOP exploits racism. And the Groundswell gang is mounting a behind-the-scenes organized effort to eradicate the outsize influence of GOP über-strategist/pundit Karl Rove within Republican and conservative ranks. (For more on Groundswell's ""two front war"" against Rove—a major clash on the right—click here.)
At the March 27 meeting, Groundswell participants discussed one multipurpose theme they had been deploying for weeks to bash the president on a variety of fronts, including immigration reform and the sequester: Obama places ""politics over public safety."" In a display of Groundswell's message-syncing, members of the group repeatedly flogged this phrase in public. Frank Gaffney penned a Washington Times op-ed titled ""Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Tom Fitton headlined a Judicial Watch weekly update ""Politics over Public Safety: More Illegal Alien Criminals Released by Obama Administration."" Peter List, editor of LaborUnionReport.com, authored a RedState.com post called ""Obama's Machiavellian Sequestration Pain Game: Putting Politics Over Public Safety."" Matthew Boyle used the phrase in an immigration-related article for Breitbart. And Dan Bongino promoted Boyle's story on Twitter by tweeting, ""Politics over public safety?"" In a message to Groundswellers, Ginni Thomas awarded ""brownie points"" to Fitton, Gaffney, and other members for promoting the ""politics over public safety"" riff.

For the past year, most political observers have focused on Republican opportunities to capture Senate seats in red-states like Louisiana and Arkansas. The GOP had a plausible, but narrow, path to capture enough of these seats to win control of the Senate. The ObamaCare disaster, however, has expanded the battlefield for control of the Senate. New polls show high-profile Democrats with negligible leads against phantom Republicans in IA, CO and MI. If these states are in play next year, Dem control of the Senate will be especially vulnerable. 
Republicans, so far, have been unable to attract high-profile candidates to contest the open seats in Iowa and Michigan or challenge Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado. All three seats have been safely in the Democrat column for much of the year. The terrible rollout of ObamaCare, however, has hurt the poll numbers of Democrats everywhere. This has become most pronounced in states that weren’t considered competitive. 
In Colorado, incumbent Sen. Mark Udall doesn’t draw more than 45% support against a host of possible GOP opponents. That level of support is a clear sign of vulnerability. Just a few months ago, Udall was a prohibitive favorite to win reelection. 
Democrats in Iowa have rallied behind Rep. Bruce Braley for the seat of retiring Sen. Tom Harkin. There is no clear GOP challenger, yet Braley can’t reach more than 42% against a number of possible challengers. 
In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters, a typical union-backed Democrat, is running to replace Sen. Carl Levin. Again, there is no high-profile consensus GOP candidate, yet Peters can’t even crack 40% support in the polls. The most recent poll found Peters leading Republican former Secretary of State, Terri Land, by just one point, 37-36. Months ago, again, Peters was considered the overwhelming favorite.
Polls in these three states suggest that ObamaCare represents an existential threat to the Democrat party next year. Setting aside the problems with the website, the program will exert a gravitational pull on everyone’s health insurance. For most voters, the impact will be negative. 
Barring some unexpected event, Democrats could be slow-walking to their own political oblivion. If the party has to spend money to defend its seat in Michigan, it is unlikely to hold its seats in states like North Carolina or Alaska. 
The 2014 elections may be getting past the point that Republicans can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The party still hasn’t learned the lessons of 2010. They are about to get another primer from voters. Hopefully, the party will know now how to listen.

Soldier in the tea party's shadow army

""Warrior"" that I am, I'll certainly be there Saturday night! Stephen Lemons at New Times reports that the Arizona Tea Party is holding a meeting this weekend to recruit a ""shadow army"" of equally shadowy ""warriors"" who can go ""toe-to-toe"" with voters who intend to sign the petition to recall Sheriff Joe Arpaio. They're looking for a force of about 400 brave warrior souls. Hell, Napoleon retook France with only 1,000 men; with 400 shadowy figures, stopping the recall should be a piece of cake.  
The petition's signature gatherers themselves are not in the shadows, but at sunny public places across the county—flea markets, libraries, downtowns, campuses, just about anywhere people congregate. If you're interested in the recall, which the tea party says is coordinated by ""paid progressive socialists,"" here's a link to Respect Arizona's website.
The New Times article quotes the invitation to this Saturday's tea party recruitment gala in its scatterbrained entirety; here's a snapshot:
The purpose of the meeting is to muster and organize a ""shadow army"" of ""shadow warriors"" that are willing to volunteer their time to stand toe-to-toe at the majority of the locations here in Maricopa County where the paid progressive socialists are collecting petition signatures to recall Sheriff Joe....
We need to make sure this abusive and egregious attempt attacking Arizona's Constitution, voter sovereignty and the will of the people here in Arizona and around the Country fails in getting enough signatures.
Randy Parraz, Chad Snow and the special interest groups that are behind this recall effort are nothing more than domestic terrorists who are attempting to turn Arizona dark blue so they can further their liberal agenda. These are the same thugs who wrongfully recalled Russell Pearce. We need to stop these people now.

Someone should point out to these nitwits that the ""egregious attempt attacking Arizona's Constitution,"" i.e., the recall, is provided for right there in the Arizona Constitution! If anything, stopping people from exercising their right to sign a petition is the ""abusive"" thing that's ""attacking Arizona's Constitution.""
Dog whistle alert! The ""domestic terrorists"" and ""thugs"" who recalled SB 1070 author Sen. Russell Pearce in 2011 (though not ""wrongfully"") were teachers, priests, seniors, librarians, business leaders and Republicans! Chad Snow, one of the Pearce recall organizers mentioned in the invitation, is a Republican. And the district in Mesa that Sen. Pearce had represented for six terms was heavily GOP and Mormon. Terrorists! Thugs! If anything, Pearce's campaign team practiced thuggery—recruiting a sham candidate to syphon votes away from the eventual winner, Republican Jerry Lewis.
Join me below the fold to learn more about this invitation from crazy.


Stephen Lemons requested some clarification of the militant language in the emailed invitation, and here's part of the reply he received from a tea party consultant:
Some Arpaio supporters have taken it upon themselves to actively engage voters who are being asked to sign this recall petition. It is their right to do so and we are happy to assist them in their efforts. Voters have a right to know that this effort is an abuse of the process; will cost the taxpayers millions; and attempts to overturn the will of the people which was just expressed a few short months ago.
You gotta wonder what ""actively engage voters"" means to the shadowed intimidators, in a state where it's perfectly legal to pack heat in public. Maybe they'll take a page out of Arizona's proud history of voter suppression, like when future Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, as a young Phoenix attorney in the 1960s, would challenge black and brown voters at the polls.
If this tea party crony wants to play the ""cost taxpayers millions"" card, how about the tens of millions of dollars that Sheriff Arpaio has cost citizens of Maricopa County for his illegal arrests, fraudulent political vendettas, even jailhouse murders? A million or so to blow away the cloud of hate that has shrouded Maricopa County for decades is money happily spent.
As for the bullshit about ""the will of the people which was just expressed,"" Sheriff Arpaio benefitted from GOP coattails in a presidential election and competitive Arizona senate race. Republicans were energized to turn out, but not for Arpaio, who only received 50.7 percent of the vote. A study by Arizona Capitol Times after the November election showed that the sheriff received very few votes from urban areas, and his support in heavily GOP suburbs is decreasing fast. Many Romney Republicans representing the Wall Street wing of the party, not the tea party cesspool, probably voted a straight ticket out of habit. However, some of them consider Arpaio a joke, and they're not likely to go to bat for the asinine coot in a recall.
I'll report back later in the week after I've enlisted in the Shadow Army. I'm having problems with the VA bureaucracy anyway, and their endorsement will no doubt grease the skids.

Did someone say creepy and depressing?



Did someone say creepy and depressing?

Oh God, no. No, no, no.
In the months before the 2012 election, a group of high-powered consultants and political operatives prepared a secret report for candidate Mitt Romney, explaining how he should take over and restructure the federal government should he win the presidency. […]
But now the secret is out. On May 29, the Romney Readiness Project, the Republican candidate’s transition organization known as R2P,  published a 138-page report detailing how it prepared for a potential Romney victory.

The actual document is horrifying. It's horrifying in exactly the way you'd expect it to be horrifying, coming from Mitt Freaking Romney's camp. It proposes treating the entire executive branch like a big financial firm, because THAT IS WHAT MITT ROMNEY KNOWS AND LOVES, PUNY FLESH-HUMANS.
“The White House staff is similar to a holding company” read one PowerPoint slide, which would have been presented to President-elect Romney as part of an expansive briefing on the morning after Election Day. It went on to list three main divisions of the metaphorical firm: “Care & Feeding Offices,” like speechwriting, “Policy Offices,” like the National Security Council, and “Packaging & Selling Offices,” like the office of the press secretary.
I see now how narrowly the satirists, comedians and other snarkish wags of America averted catastrophe last November. There is no way anyone with any sense of humor could have survived the first hundred days of a Mitt Romney ""let's treat the Oval Office like a big Wall Street firm"" presidency without dying outright. The true cynics would have been killed off within a week; the optimists, within a month. It was a cunning plan to murder comedy outright.
Among the recommendations for the Romney administration:
• Corporate-style training seminars were planned for appointees and nominees before the inauguration to teach management skills.
• A plan to restructure White House operations to suit Romney’s corporate management style, with clear deliverables.
• Detailed flow charts delineating how information and decisions were disseminated through the administration to achieve “unity.”

Once you get past the inherent terror of someone trying to think of the White House as a ""holding company"" and whatnot, most of the supposed details of the plan seem simplistic at best, for something allegedly the product of a 500 person team—for example, a long series of slides explaining how the White House is organized, written with words like ""COO"" and ""Selling"" in an apparent attempt to explain these things to whatever executive business critters were going to be brought on board to run those things. The policy prescriptions are broad and consist almost entirely of the same one-sentence vows Romney was making in various campaign forums. (Given that more than a few tax dollars helped pay for them to come up with this stuff, charging the general public $24.95 to see the depressing end results seems a bit insulting.)
The White House as holding company, though–gonna be seeing that one in my nightmares. Now I know how the people in Russia felt when that meteor whizzed over their heads.

Do you want to help the Republican Party figure out what went wrong, in 2012? Of course you do. Towards that end, the Republican party has launched the Growth & Opportunity Project, chaired by such luminaries as Henry Barbour and Ari Fleischer, to recommend how best to not screw things up quite so horribly next time. And to help with that, they're using that most scientific of all tools, an internet survey.
The questions are, sadly, rather generic:
Which issues do you think Republicans should spend MORE time talking about? (please select one)
    - Fiscal issues, like taxes, government spending, and the debt
    - Economic issues, like unemployment, housing, and high energy prices
    - National Security issues, like terrorism, foreign policy, and national defense
    - Social issues, like abortion and family values
They also ask you to rate how much ""improvement"" the party needs in areas like ""Diversity within the Party"" and ""How the Party communicates with voters.""
Republicans looking to interject their opinions will probably be disappointed, however. In a dozen or so pages of questions to fill out, only four or so invite you to give your input on the actual Republican Party and their efforts. All the others are demographic questions—data mining stuff. What's your name? What age are you? What's your email address, little feller? You know, the kind of questions you teach your kids not to answer during their own internet sessions.
Hey, at least the party leaders are asking for opinions, right? Your opinion is only worth about 1/4th of the content on an actual opinion survey, but it's a start? Surely it's not just a flimsy effort towards party list-building under the guise of momentary introspection.

Rep. Paul Ryan, seen here telling the crowd why good Jesus-based values demand we cut Food Stamps and meal assistance for seniors yet again because those kids and old people will probably just trade that food for abortions or something. Probably.

The most interesting thing about Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom Forum being held this week is that it exists at all. Ralph Reed, for those precious few of you who do not remember recent political history, is a crook. He is a political scammer who worked with Jack Abramoff in a swindle of Native American tribes and conservative Christians alike, a scam that went to the heart of the conservative movement but in which every last person save Abramoff himself has undergone a magical conversion back into respectability based essentially on the same scam as they started out with, which is duping Good Christian People out of their money.
So to have Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Allen West, Ron Johnson, Rick Santorum, Gohmert-Perry-Bachman-Palin-Cain-and-everyone-else-who-is-anyone in far-right conservatism eagerly climb aboard the good ship Ralph Reed for his latest little shindig should tell you all you need to know about the sincerity of the whole movement. He's a lobbyist who got caught in a money laundering scandal, and he was back lobbying and collecting checks in no time flat because, bluntly, all the conservatives currently surrounding him were just fine with that. Just don't get caught again, Ralph, and everyone will go along with the political scammer running a supposed morality-based movement. Everyone involved is exactly that shallow.
All right, so let's do this thing. Here's a brief roundup of the stuff that the very important people saw fit to get up in front of a microphone and preach about to a group of moral scolds led by scammers and crooks—the conservative Mob, dressed up nice and pretty. Below the fold lie the details:



Paul Ryan is all about riling the churchfolk against Obamacare. “Obamacare says that if you believe in the social teaching of your church, if you disagree with abortifacients — with abortion inducing drugs — it doesn’t matter. You, if you’re a church or a charity or a hospital, you have to buy health insurance that offers your employees these things that are in contradiction to your beliefs. This is what the federal government is demanding.” Well, he's lying about the church part, since they've been granted special godbothering exception, and we've already been through the bit about how yes, you don't get to decide what religion your secular employees will adhere to because we are not the goddamn Taliban, at least not yet. I don't believe for a moment that Paul Ryan cares about the religious implications of Obamacare, but I do believe he cares about riling the rubes into giving him money, which is what this entire little exercise is about.
Allen West urged the audience to go to black D.C. neighborhoods so they could see how ""progressive socialism and policies that have broken down the family"" have turned it into a hellhole. As usual, Allen West has dedicated himself to not making any sense at all, so we will just leave that there and back away slowly.
Macro Rubio was there to let folks know that it's perfectly reasonable to fire people for being gay and that he's against any attempts to stop it. Sen. Ron Johnson agrees.
Rick Santorum was there to say … oh, who the hell cares. What's that? I have to care? Sigh, fine. Ol' Froth'n'Spit was ticked at Mitt Romney and the GOP for not paying enough attention to ""a single janitor, waitress or person who worked"" in the companies the GOP propped up as American success stories. Don't recall Rick Santorum doing that either, primarily because his own campaign was focused exclusively on telling people how moral Rick Santorum was and how the entire nation should be like Rick. In other news about Republican morality, fellow sortof-candidate Fred Karger just filed a complaint with the FEC alleging that the Santorum campaign paid $1 million to get the endorsement of prominent moralizing jackass Bob Vander Plaats, so that should be fun to watch.
Jeb Bush praised immigrants for being ""more fertile"" than native-born Americans. Yes, that happened. If I have to live with knowing that happened, so do you.
Young America's Foundation president Kate Obenshein opined that ""college campuses are indoctrination camps for the abortion industry."" That is a fascinating opinion and in no way the bizarre rantings of a fevered mind.
Michele Bachmann says that it isn't ""prudent"" to move forward with better treatment for undocumented immigrants because the ""average illegal alien"" is uneducated and we'll have to spend taxes on them and the people who ""will suffer the most"" from treating them better are ""Hispanics and African Americans who already suffer very high levels of unemployment."" You know, your standard Jesus stuff.
Donald Trump is one of the speakers. No, you can't make me care about what Donald Trump has to say to a room full of holier-than-thou types, but this is the sort of ""faith-based"" conference that attracts people like Donald Freaking Trump. Savor that, you Republican bastards.

So there's your lineup of crooks led by crooks trying to figure out how to best pry money out of the American pocket to give to other crooks. I'm sure there will be more coming, since the ambitious types always use these faith-based conferences to try to outdo each other. Lots of scenery-chewing at these things.

Welcome to the debut of my newest feature entitled ""Taking Back The House:  2014"".  I'm aware of the current truth that mid-terms are not a good time for the incumbent President's party.  We all remember what happened in 2010 and are unlikely to forget that night anytime soon.
However, I remain an optimist in the sense that the low popularity of the House Republicans will hurt them.  They are the party in power in the House and the wave that rode them to sweeping electoral victory, will be more subdued two years later.  When the Tea Party catches wind that some of their favorites voted for the ""fiscal cliff"" deal and have yet to do a thing other than obstruct, it might get fairly ugly for the GOP.
Or so we hope.


When I was thinking of how to start this feature, my brain immediately settled on one candidate that could signify what I’d aspire to get done.  I support a House in which most of its members do their jobs and are rarely known to anyone other than their constituents.  Of course, that’s impossible but when a candidate puts their political aspirations above their people (which is all-too-common on both sides of the aisle), they will be put on blast.  When regression, not progression, is the ultimate goal; they will deserve a spot here.
So who signifies that better than Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann.  Representing Minnesota’s 6th district since 2006, Bachmann probably deserves no introduction for all the headlines she has very proudly generated.  Yet, let’s take a look at the legislative, electoral and overall career of Michele Bachmann.

Legislation:
-Bringing up, for the 34th time, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
If there could be anything that will automatically earn you a place on this spot, it’s actions like these.  The ACA is the law of the land and slowly become more integrated into our health care system.  The fact that this cannot essentially get repealed until 2017 is noteworthy.  This is a bill that’s created to throw “red meat” to national conservatives and to generate some early headlines.  It’s a waste of time that could be used to well….stonewall other bills and make John Boehner weep but time nonetheless.
-The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act
This Bachmann’s other signature piece of legislation, another one that is advocating a repeal and another one that was not enacted.  The Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act would signify the repeal of the government ban of incandescent light bulbs.
Headlines:
-Founder of the Tea Party Caucus
-Notably went on Hardball With Chris Matthews and encouraged investigations to determine if members of Congress were “anti-American”.
-Won Ames Straw Poll in 2011 which would lead to her collapsing in polls and dropping out of the presidential race the day after the Iowa Caucus.
-Claimed President Obama wanted to enact Sharia Law in America.
-Claimed Huma Abedin was part of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence even though she has no foreign policy credentials.  
Electoral History:
2006: Bachmann (R): 50.1%, Patty Wetterling (D): 42.1%, John Binkowski (I): 7.8%
2008: Bachmann (R): 46.4%, Elwyn Tinklenberg (D), 43.4%, Bob Anderson (I): 10%
2010: Bachmann (R): 52.5%, Taryl Clark (D): 39.8%, Anderson (I): 5.8%
2012: Bachmann (R): 50.5%, Jim Graves (D): 49.5%
Cook PVI:
R+10
Prospects:
I would say that this list should begin with Jim Graves, who gave Bachmann the closest run for her seat.  Graves is a small-business owner and a local Minnesotan who nearly won even by being outspent from 10:1 margin.  To learn more about Graves, check out his bio on his website here.
I believe that he is the best contender though I would like to hear what somebody from Minnesota might know.
Why We Can Do This:
The district is pretty significantly Republican but Bachmann has barely crossed over 50% of the vote, even in the tidal wave that was 2010.  Now, she is an amazing fundraiser but her reputation is so well-known that I don’t think money can erase all the obstruction she has done in the House.  Bachmann has reached her ceiling, it appears, so what the DFL of Minnesota might have to do is make this a very local race considering Bachmann is a highly national figure.
The fact that Bachmann has difficulties staying north of 50% gives us hope in 2014.  Fundraising for the opponent could be a national exercise and if started early enough, we could see some good results.
Remember if Bachmann is out of politics, it would be a huge blow to the Tea Party and would help us regain our sanity.
To sort of paraphrase her, “Repeal and Replace Bachmann”.
(Note on this feature:  We cannot sit idly as the majority Republican House does nothing.  Can we guarantee that a Democratic majority would change things?  Not at all.  But we can try.
Hence why I’m also putting this in your hands.  Share this on your Facebook, “like” candidate’s (which we will tout) Facebook pages, retweet posts from here and maybe even send it to your local Democratic Party.  If we are going to take back the House, with a fairly sizable Republican majority, then it’s going to take us.  The grassroots.
All campaigns are national, but stay local.  It would be great to have a Democratic Party that goes back to the “50-state strategy”.
But it all starts with us, the voters.  Us, the netrooters.  Us, the people.  Let’s start this project now and see what we are capable of.)
11:10 PM PT: 1/06/13 2:09AM:  Rec List?  Thank you all so much including the Rescue Rangers!  
-For those just reading or not reading, please mention in the comments how often we should all do this feature and any other ideas on how to make it better!  Thank you all.

Unlike almost every governor, U.S. Senator, House Member, and state legislator, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker did not graduate from college.
According to his wiki entry about his time at Marquette he presumably wrote:
He enrolled at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1986. He attended college for four years but never graduated, working part-time for IBM selling warranties. His IBM job led to a full-time position in marketing and fundraising at the American Red Cross from 1990 to 1994.
snip
Walker made his first try for government office in 1990 at age 22, winning the Republican nomination for Milwaukee's 7th District seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly, but losing in the general election to incumbent Democrat Gwen Moore. He moved to the predominantly Republican edge city of Wauwatosa, when its Assembly seat opened up in 1993, winning the special election.

So, according to the semi-official bio, Walker left college in his senior year to run for State Assembly, and after losing went to work for the Red Cross.
Sure, Walker was ambitious, but most ambitious pols earn at least a bachelor's before running for office, or find a way to complete the degree after the campaign.
Perhaps Walker had no choice about leaving Marquette after four years, but still about a year short of getting a degree.
That's what Glen Barry, a Marquette contemporary of Walker, thinks.
Details, below.  
 


Charlie Pierce, a Marquette alumnus who has memorably named Walker ""the goggle-eyed homunculus hired by Koch Industries to manage their midwest subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin,"" linked to Barry's remembrance of Walker at Marquette this way in a post well worth reading ""The Wisconsin Recall Is About One Thing: No More Him"":
A former Marquette classmate has written about Walker's time on the Avenue, and intimates quite clearly what has been a persistent rumor in alumni circles -- that Walker was asked to leave Marquette due to some academic shenanigans. Thus far, Walker has declined to release his college transcripts, so the question remains open. Noonan's Law applies — is it irresponsible to speculate? It would be irresponsible not to.
Barry, who graduated and went on to earn a Ph.D. from UW Madison, recounts Walker's dirty campaigning for two campus-wide offices, both of which he lost.
There are many delicious details at the link, including the college newspaper concluding that Walker was ""unfit for office"" due to his being ""sanctioned for illegal campaigning on numerous occasions, and brutal personal attacks upon his opponent’s character."" Plus, ""Walker’s campaign was secretly and systematically (stealing and) throwing out copies of the newspaper that endorsed his opponent"" (prior to the ""unfit for office"" editorial), and newspapers never like that kind of theft.
But the key bit is this:
I wish I could say definitely why he never graduated – it is a closely guarded secret. I believe the general line of thinking – that Scott Walker was caught cheating.
Well, that makes sense.
Walker was not a good student -- he has refused to release his transcripts, but his 2010 campaign said that his GPA was 2.59.
And then there's the timing issue -- Walker enrolled at Marquette in the fall of 1986 and left sometime in 1990, which is four, or three and a half at least, years.
Yet he was substantially short of the credit hours required for graduation:
Walker released a letter from Marquette that showed he attended the school for four years, from 1986 to 1990, and would have needed to stay there for at least another year to get a degree. He had 94 credits and would have needed at least 36 more. The exact number of credits he needed isn't clear because students must take classes in certain areas of study to get degrees.
Somewhere along the way, Walker lost a year's worth of college credit.
Maybe, in the two years he was running for college offices, he took some incompletes that he did not make up.
Maybe his parents decided they did not want to fund a five-year plan.
Maybe Walker got caught cheating, and was told to get out of Marquette and not return.
So he didn't.
Walker's ancient history is, IMHO, far more relevant than Romney's prep-school bullying or Obama's teen-age drug use -- Walker was a far-right pol in training at Marquette, his college campaigns were wingnut, dirty and fact-free, and he moved as quickly as possible into political office.
In the words of Babu Bhatt, Walker is a very, very bad man.
And has been since Marquette.
Tom Barrett needs lots of help to retire Walker, those of you with credit cards can help here.

David Corn brings us news of yet another quasi-""secret"" conservative group looking to shape messaging and the media coverage of that messaging. That yet another one exists, and that like others one of their top priorities is defeating not-conservative-enough Karl Rove and demanding a more radical conservatism of their conservatives, is not too surprising. That they seem to be in opposition to uberconservative Grover Norquist is a bit more surprising, but I suppose Norquist has gone out of favor now that people in the movement have started to suspect him of secret Muslimizm.
The list of people who participate in these ""Groundswell"" strategizing sessions, however, has a definite B-grade flavor to it.
One of the influential conservatives guiding the group is Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas, a columnist for the Daily Caller and a tea party consultant and lobbyist. Other Groundswell members include John Bolton, the former UN ambassador; Frank Gaffney, the president of the Center for Security Policy; Ken Blackwell and Jerry Boykin of the Family Research Council; Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch; Gayle Trotter, a fellow at the Independent Women's Forum; Catherine Engelbrecht and Anita MonCrief of True the Vote; Allen West, the former GOP House member; Sue Myrick, also a former House GOPer; Diana Banister of the influential Shirley and Banister PR firm; and Max Pappas, a top aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).
Oh, well if you've got John Bolton, the Family Research Council and Allen West thinking up your strategy, I'm sure nothing can go wrong with that. Also featured prominently are various Breitbart apparatchiks, so you know it's top-notch stuff.
At its weekly meetings, the group aims to strengthen the right's messaging by crafting Twitter hashtags; plotting strategy on in-the-headlines issues such as voter ID, immigration reform, and the sequester; promoting politically useful scandals; and developing ""action items.""
Oh God, stop, you're killing me. #HashtagBasedStrategizing
Groundswell members saw immigration as a life-or-death issue. ""If we lose on immigration,"" the post-meeting memo noted, ""we lose on every other issue. […]""
The group also reviewed how best to oppose the confirmation of Tom Perez, Obama's nominee for labor secretary. Groundsweller's claimed that Perez, then a senior Justice Department official, supported ""Muslim Brotherhood organizations and Shariah."" (One Groundswell memo maintained that Perez ""is extremely antagonistic toward whites."") A third agenda item that Wednesday morning was beating back the effort to end the Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay scouts. […] The post-meeting memo suggested Twitter hashtags to push: #CantTrustObama, #PoliticsOverPublicSafety, #SequesterLies.

A troupe of Rove-hating conservatives who spend their days talking about Sharia conspiracies. I'm beginning to see why this group is secret: I think it's so they don't get teased. Also, members literally seem to get something called ""brownie points"" for putting out the group's message, which in any other context would probably be humiliating for all involved. Not them, though!
The Groundswellers feel that they too often lose the political narrative to their progressive rivals. One memo that circulated among members declared, ""We must reclaim the language and put 'a face' on our messages; tell stories. Write articles on 4th grade level!""
Some of you have almost managed 3rd grade level, so don't lose hope. Practice! You'll get there eventually.
There's one place I have to disagree with David Corn's reporting on this story. He refers to some of the persons involved as ""journalists,"" citing Breitbart ""News"" participants and others. I don't think you can claim that; the Breitbart group does not do ""journalism,"" they do something … else. Their namesake made the brand on pushing falsified ""pimp tape""-style stories to gullible peers. While it would indeed be alarming if ""journalists"" were coordinating strategies with the likes of Ginni Thomas, Frank Gaffney (snicker), John Bolton (cackle) and Allen Freaking West (it hurts, stop, I need a moment!), none of the columnists, ""researchers"" or Fox News hangers-on named in the story really pass as ""journalists"" in the conventional sense of the term. They might claim otherwise, but that doesn't make it true, and we really shouldn't just accept such claims at face value.
The Breitbarters seem to play a substantive role in the group, which gives you an indication of the caliber of minds at work here, and is probably one force behind the group's apparent routine of thinking up good-sounding storylines first, then bothering with the ""evidence"" later. I am not thinking there is much to fear from this particular peanut gallery, but it might be interesting in the future to watch their promotion of certain themes and how they collect their ""brownie points"" for reinforcing each other's messages. Hell, we can give them ""brownie points"" ourselves, right? Ten points to Slytherin, guys, but come up with a really good hashtag and I'll make it 15. #MelonSizedCalves?

Senate Republicans aren't just forcing all night sessions to exact their revenge on Democrats for invoking the nuclear option and ending the filibuster on nominations, they've escalated the fight to preventing the Judiciary Committee from even meeting.
Under a rarely enforced Senate rule, committees can't meet more than two hours after the Senate goes into session. Routinely, senators give unanimous consent to waive the rule so the committee can carry out the chamber's—and the country's—business. But today, Republicans refused unanimous consent to let the Judiciary Committee meet.
The committee has a busy schedule, with votes scheduled for 15 judicial nominees who have testified before the members and answered follow-up written questions. Among those are nominees for vacancies designated as judicial emergencies by the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. Each one of the nominees has been fully vetted and has the support of their home state senators, including Republicans Mark Kirk (IL), Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran (KS), Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker (TN), Roy Blunt (MO), and Pat Toomey (PA). [...]
If the committee is not able to meet until next week—the last week the Senate is expected to be in session—and Republicans force the nominees to be held over, then they'll be stuck in committee at year's end. Since that will be the end of a session of Congress, absent unanimous consent to do otherwise, Senate rules require the nominees to be sent back to the president for renomination in the next session. That would force all of these nominees to repeat the committee voting process all over again, where once again the GOP could find new ways to slow them down.

Can anyone doubt that Republicans will continue to do anything they can to force these nominations to expire before the end of the year? They'll do whatever possible to block these nominees for as long as possible. This means that Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), chair of the Judiciary Committee, is going to have to be willing to establish new rules, or ignore existing ones as much as is in his power to do so.
That's going to include ending the ""blue-slip"" tradition. That's the tradition of asking the home state senators of a nominee to support the nomination by signing off on a ""blue slip."" Leahy says that he intends to continue to honor the tradition because he ""assume[s] no one will abuse the blue slip process like some have abused the use of the filibuster to block judicial nominees on the floor of the Senate."" If they're going to abuse the rules to keep his committee from meeting, they're going to abuse blue slips. Leahy is going to have to act to allow his committee to function again.

Maureen Dowd looks as the disconnect between the Senate of the lobbyists, and the wishes of the people, and somehow concludes the fault is at the other end of the street.
How is it that the president won the argument on gun safety with the public and lost the vote in the Senate? It’s because he doesn’t know how to work the system. And it’s clear now that he doesn’t want to learn, or to even hire some clever people who can tell him how to do it or do it for him.
It’s unbelievable that with 90 percent of Americans on his side, he could get only 54 votes in the Senate. It was a glaring example of his weakness in using leverage to get what he wants. No one on Capitol Hill is scared of him.

Somehow I had the idea that Congress was there to represent the people, and that when 90 percent of the people want something, it's shouldn't be on the president to make it happen. I had no idea that only the president was accountable to the public.
President Obama thinks he can use emotion to bring pressure on Congress. But that’s not how adults with power respond to things. He chooses not to get down in the weeds and pretend he values the stroking and other little things that matter to lawmakers.
So, using emotion, say pointing out the families in Newtown who lost beautiful children, isn't how adults do things? Adults need their pitiful egos petted and their little things stroked? That, Mo, may be the single most idiotic paragraph I've read. Ever. Tell you what, let's see how much ego-boo these assholes get when we bench them for not doing what the voters want.
Come on in, before I say something that shouldn't be on the front page on Sunday morning.


Bill Daley delivers some blame with better aim.
I want my money back.
Last October, I gave $2,500 to support Heidi Heitkamp’s campaign to become North Dakota’s junior senator. A few weeks later, she won a surprise victory.
I have had a long career in government and politics, but I don’t donate heavily to political campaigns. When I contribute, it’s because I know the candidate well or am really impressed with the person. Heidi Heitkamp was one of the latter: She struck me as strong-willed, principled and an independent thinker.
But this week, Heitkamp betrayed those hopes. ...
Polling has shown that nine in 10 Americans and eight in 10 gun owners support a law to require every buyer to go through a background check on every gun sale. In North Dakota, the support was even higher: 94 percent. Yet in explaining her vote, Heitkamp had the gall to say that she “heard overwhelmingly from the people of North Dakota” and had to listen to them and vote no. It seems more likely that she heard from the gun lobby and chose to listen to it instead.

Carl Hiaasen touches base with the ""reasonable"" GOP alternative.
Marco Rubio showed his true yellow colors last week, joining 45 other cowards to defeat Senate legislation designed to stop criminals from buying firearms online and at gun shows.
The vote was nauseating. So is Rubio.
A few days earlier, he’d admitted to Fox News that he hadn’t read the complete bill that would expand federal background checks of gun buyers, but he was opposing it anyway.
Other pertinent materials that Rubio obviously didn’t read included a recent New York Times sampling of nut jobs, convicted criminals and even one fugitive who purchased assault rifles and other weapons over the Internet.

Funny how some people actually hold senators responsible for their own actions. It's almost treating them like... adults.
Ross Douthat hits one of those rare weeks when I agree with him.
...we discovered another world last week. Two, actually — both somewhat larger than Earth, circling a star with the sadly unromantic name of Kepler 62, 1,200 light-years away.
These planets are not the first Earth-like bodies astronomers have discovered, but their size and position make them particularly promising candidates to have liquid water — and with it, perhaps, some form of life.
But their promise only adds to a mystery that’s been building the further our probes and telescopes have pushed into the unknown. If Earth-like planets are relatively common, as scientists increasingly believe, then where are all the Earth-like civilizations?

Douthat's take on the Fermi Paradox (that ""where is everyone"" question) are all pretty bleak. I prefer a nursery analogy. The grown ups are keeping us out of the galactic mainstream until we mature a bit. Or maybe we just haven't learned to stroke their things. Moving on...
Thomas Friedman only makes it on this page about one every two Friedman units. So what's he up to today?
Rebuilding our strength has to start with healing our economy. In that regard, it feels as if our budget drama has dragged on for so long that it has not only been drained of all emotional energy but nobody even remembers the plot anymore. It’s worth recalling: What are we trying to do?
We’re trying to put America back on a sustainable growth track that will expand employment, strengthen our fiscal balance sheet to withstand future crises and generate resources to sustain the most needy and propel the next generation. That requires three things: We need to keep investing in the engines of our growth — infrastructure, government-financed research, education, immigration and regulations that incentivize risk-taking but prevent recklessness.

Friedman's column overfloweth with the kind of overwriting, self praise and calls for a ""radical center"" that you expect from the flatman, but there is this...
The best place to start is with a carbon tax.
A phased-in carbon tax of $20 to $25 a ton could raise around $1 trillion over 10 years, as we each pay a few more dimes and quarters for every gallon of gasoline or hour of electricity. With that new revenue stream, we’d have so many more options. One, preferred by Republicans like the statesman George Shultz and the Nobel laureate Gary Becker, is to make the carbon tax “revenue neutral.” It could be offset entirely by a rebate or by cutting tax rates for every U.S. citizen and corporation, which would increase spending. Another option, the one I’d prefer, would devote half the carbon-tax revenues to individual and corporate tax cuts, use a quarter for new investments in infrastructure, preschool education, community colleges and research — which would create jobs now and tomorrow — and then use a quarter on deficit reduction.

Doyle McManus also talks carbon tax (and does it much better).
... here's another good bipartisan idea that the tax committees should consider: a new federal tax on emissions — more frequently called a carbon tax.
We already know that we use more energy from oil, gas and coal than we really need. (America consumes the equivalent of about 48 barrels of oil per person per year; Germany, with the healthiest economy in Europe, consumes just 26.) We know that lower consumption would make us less dependent on other countries for energy, a goal every president since Richard Nixon has pursued. We know that oil and coal produce air pollution, which we'd like to reduce. And we know that those fuels emit carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.
Economists call the hidden costs of energy consumption — the prices of climate change, pollution and national security — ""externalities."" They're real costs, but they're not included in the price of the gasoline you put in your car or the electricity you use at home.

Phillip Roth praises the home room teacher he had when he was twelve. Doesn't sound like something that would catch your attention? Did I mention it was Phillip Roth?
NY Times Magazine talks with another of my favorites.
On a recent Saturday morning in February, two dozen or so scent hounds streamed through the streets of St. Buryan, a small village in Cornwall, England. Behind them drifted a loose formation of men and women perched atop well-groomed horses and wearing boots, breeches and hunting coats. As the fox hunt clopped through town, John le Carré, the pre-eminent spy writer of the 20th century, sipped from a paper cup of warm whiskey punch, doled out by a local pub to riders and spectators.
At 81, he remains an enviable specimen of humanity: tall, patrician, cleanlimbed, ruddy-complected. His white hair is floppy and well cut, so much so that the actor Ralph Fiennes, who starred in the 2005 film version of le Carré’s novel “The Constant Gardener,” badgered him for the name of his barber.

le Carré comes off as crusty, snooty, and brilliant. He comes off as le Carré.
Dana Millbank is worried about the new Tea Party fan favorite.
Is there nobody who can tell Ted Cruz to shut up?
The young senator from Texas has been on the job for about 100 days, but he has already turned the Senate’s ancient seniority system upside down and is dominating his senior Republican colleagues. He’s speaking for them on immigration, guns and any other topic that tickles his fancy; Republican leaders are seething at being outshone yet are terrified of challenging him.
...
GOP lawmakers encouraged the rise of the tea party, which now dominates Republican primaries and threatens the same leaders who nurtured it. Cruz’s fellow Texan, John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, could face a primary challenge next year and therefore can’t afford to cross Cruz, who beat an establishment Republican in the 2012 primary. Likewise, the Senate GOP leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, is up for reelection and has to keep on the good side of tea party favorites such as Sen. Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, and Cruz.

Perhaps those leaders are too busy getting stroked to bother with Cruz. (No, I'm not letting that go.)
Leonard Pitts checks in on the other hand on the GOP tiller.
Rand Paul did just fine at Howard University, thank you very much. Or at least, that’s how he remembers it.
Paul, GOP senator from Kentucky, told the Christian Science Monitor on Wednesday that his recent visit to Howard didn’t go so bad at all. He said any perception to the contrary was created by — all together now — the “left-wing media.”
Knowing what we do about the political right’s capacity for self-deception, we may trust that he’s telling it like it is — or at least, telling it like he believes it to be.
But reality-based Americans know it wasn’t left-wing media that insulted students at the historically black school by acting as if a visit to their campus was like a visit with headhunters. “Some have said that I’m either brave or crazy to be here,” Paul said, somehow resisting the urge to add, “Me come-um in peace.”

After serving eleven terms in Congress, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL) announced on Monday he will not seek reelection. “It is time for someone else,” said Bachus.
After chairing the powerful House Financial Services Committee for six years, Bachus gave up his chairmanship in 2012 following a Office of Congressional Ethics investigation. In my book, Throw Them All Out, I, along with subsequent reporting by Breitbart News, uncovered evidence of insider trading. 60 Minutes and I partnered together on an investigation that uncovered insider trading by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Bachus. Congress then passed the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act to ban members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.
Not surprisingly, Bachus’s friends on the committee cleared him of the charges, but not before he was forced to spend $422,000 in legal fees funded by his campaign account and another $209,000 from his legal expense trust. In true crony fashion, as Politico reported, “the bulk of Bachus’s legal defense fund take came from croporations and PACs with ties to Alabama, including Mortgage American, Inc., Bryant Bank, and Citizens Bancorp of Winfield, Inc.”
This brand of cynical, crony capitalist behavior led the late Andrew Breitbart to be the first to call for Bachus’s resignation.
“What Congressman Spencer Bachus did was wrong, vile, and an affront to the decency of the American people and the principles of honesty and fairness upon which our system rests,” wrote Breitbart. “Our Founding Fathers believed political leadership was a call to stewardship, not self-enrichment….Spencer Bachus: it’s time for you to go.”
During the summer and fall of 2008 leading up to the financial meltdown, Bachus used his post as the ranking Republican on the House Financial Service Committee to gain access to high-level meetings with then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and other top senior officials. The meetings were so secretive that all those attending were required to leave their cell phones outside the room so that no information would leak or be misused. Bachus then executed a series of expertly-timed stock trades that resulted in as much as $50,000 (politicians report in ranges, not specific amounts) in capital gains from July to November 2008. Put simply, even as everyday Americans’ personal portfolios were going up in smoke, Bachus used material, non-public information to protect and profit his own portfolio.
“Spencer Bachus did something I believe is unforgivable–he sold out his country by shorting stocks during the worse days of the financial collapse,” said Stephen K. Bannon, Executive Chairman of Breitbart News. “Spencer Bachus will always be an emblem of everything wrong with the ‘District of Corruption.’ Good riddance.”
Free markets flourish only when those who claim to champion them abide by the rule of law. Ironically, Bachus’s actions helped mobilize and reinvigorate the foot soldiers in the economic freedom movement; on November 17, 2011, Tea Party members assembled outside Bachus’s Alabama offices in protest. Their efforts sent a strong signal that true capitalists believe in competition and fairness–not insider access to top secret government information that can be used to subvert markets and poach profits. 
“Spencer Bachus holds the unfortunate distinction of being the only member of Congress that Andrew Breitbart called on to resign, and that includes Anthony Weiner,” said Larry Solov, CEO and President of Breitbart News.
Spencer Bachus will soon be gone, yet the fight against the cronyism continues. Here’s hoping it won’t take another Spencer Bachus to keep the free market torch alight."

It's a rare story when you get TWO Republican Presidential candidates in one scandal, but the Kent Sorenson story gives you that.
FBI officials executed a search warrant at former state Sen. Kent Sorenson’s home two weeks ago and confiscated computers and other materials connected to presidential campaign politics, his lawyer told The Des Moines Register today.
“We were not notified that he was the target of any investigation,” attorney Theodore Sporer told the Register. “They took computers and things that would be used to verify or validate communications with presidential entities.”

Des Moines Register
“It wasn’t a ‘raid,’” Sporer told the Register. “They executed a search warrant that, frankly, we anticipated was coming.”
The FBI on Wednesday, Nov. 20 were at Sorenson’s home for several hours and took computers belonging to his children, as well, Sporer said. “I assume it’s just kind of a dragnet to sweep for anything they could possibly find,” he said. “They’re very thorough.”

For those new to this story, Sorenson has some influence in Iowa politics. He worked for Michele Bachmann's presidential campaign before jumping ship to go over to Ron Paul's.
It is not legal to pay a member of the Iowa state Senate to work on your Presidential campaign, but the Bachmann campaign allegedly did just that, and laundered the money through a Colorado firm. Sorenson is also alleged to have asked for money to change over to the Paul campaign, and received a check for $25,000 and an EBT of $73,000 from them.
He is also alleged to have stolen an email mailing list of Iowa Christian home schooling advocates and used it on behalf of Michele Bachmann's campaign.
If the irony of three ostentatiously Christian Republicans being involved in shenanigans of this nature is not apparent to you, recalibrate your irony detector.

Ya got your work cut out for you, Reince



Ya got your work cut out for you, Reince

The big problem Republicans face in trying to rebrand their party as more tolerant and inclusive is, of course, all the damn Republicans:
A Michigan member of the Republican National Committee said Thursday he will not resign after posting an article critical of gay people on his Facebook page, despite calls from members of his own party that he step down.
Dave Agema, who served as a state representative from 2007 until December posted an excerpt from an article titled ""Everyone Should Know These Statistics On Homosexuals"" on his Facebook page Wednesday. A group of 21 Michigan Republicans, including local precinct delegates and members of the University of Michigan College Republicans, has called it ""deplorable.""

The so-called article was in fact just a particularly vile and hateful screed, claiming things like ""part of the homosexual agenda is to get the public to affirm their filthy lifestyle,"" that gay Americans are obsessed with ""recruiting children"" and so forth. This also is a good representation of how the party base operates, which is to base all of their deep policy decisions on ""obviously insane stuff they read on Facebook."" Anyway, the Michigan party chair and Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus both had to come out with new statements about treating people with dignity and respect and so on, though I'm almost positive they just have a form letter for that by now.
How many of these stories have we had, just in the last few days? Priebus brags about a new effort to spend $10 million for outreach in minority communities, a number which probably is going to need to be doubled after Don Young's foul ""wetbacks"" comments on Thursday. He might get more bang for the buck if he spends that kind of money on Shutting Your Damn Trap lessons for all current members of the Republican hierarchy. Or not; it's not clear it's a lesson any of them could learn, no matter how much effort you put into it.

AZ Gov. Jan Brewer, seen here doing her state proud



AZ Gov. Jan Brewer, seen here doing her state proud

You really have to hand it to Arizona Republicans. If your philosophy is that government can't possibly do anything right, it only makes sense that you'd spend all your time being willfully incompetent:
Arizona Governor Jan Brewer on Monday signed legislation forcing municipalities to resell firearms from gun buy-back programs rather than destroy them, closing a loophole in the conservative state's laws.
Brewer, a Republican and staunch gun rights advocate, signed the bill preventing local governments from melting down the weapons obtained from these popular civic events. Before the new law, the state had allowed such firearms to be destroyed.

This had become a bit of a big deal in Arizona, because Arizona gun nuts saw all those guns getting taken off the streets and had a sad. Yes, we know America has been having issues of late, what with murdered kids and assassination attempts against congresspeople and the like, but won't somebody think of the guns? Those poor, lonely guns? How dare you give people cash for their guns, and then melt them down for scrap, you government monsters! That's like a gun abortion! You're all anti-murder gun murderers!
Or something. Anyway, now all that's solved with the brilliant new Arizona Republican plan. What Arizona will do from now on is hold gun buy-back programs to get guns off the streets, including (by nature of the events) potentially damaged or otherwise unsafe weapons that the owners want to get rid of because they are damaged or unsafe, and then sell them right back again for (presumably) less money because FISCAL RESPONSIBILITAH. Yes, of course it's stupid, but now it's the law. (It's very much akin to the equally brilliant Arizona idea to sell their own capitol building, then lease it back at a higher cost. Yes, they actually did that. The average IQ of Arizona Republicans is apparently only a fraction of the average Arizona daily temperature.)
So at long last, Arizona guns are safe again, and Arizona towns will find themselves in the very patriotic position of removing old and damaged weapons from their neighborhoods only to sell them right back again, and nothing can possibly go wrong from that. Now if you'll excuse Jan Brewer, she has to get a start on the newest conservative plan for Arizona. They're going to fill in the Grand Canyon to make the Colorado River easier to reach. They'll need a lot of dirt, of course, but don't worry—there's a lot of dirt down at the bottom of the Canyon already, so they reckon they'll just use that.

This week's compilation includes: three police-involved accidents, two of which occurred during gun training classes; three ""home invasion shootings""( i.e., when one Patriot elects to share a Liberty Projectile with a neighbor, via a Freedom Wall, Window, Floor or Ceiling); five accidents while cleaning loaded guns; three hunting accidents; one concealed carry ninja who shot himself taking his gun out of his pocket, and one who was shot by a child reaching into his pocket. And speaking of the kids, there were nine victims of GunFAIL this week, aged 10 months, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11 and 14. You may have noticed that that's not nine ages. It was a particularly rough week for the 10-year-olds, of which we lost two, and saw one wounded.
Stories of particular note this week include that of the second Carolinian to leave a gun behind in a New York hotel this month; a tee-ball rage shooting; the opening of turkey hunting season (resulting in the shooting of two turkey hunters and an undetermined number of turkeys), and; a potential Idiot Hall of Fame entry involving the Florida man (of course) who tried to convert his BB gun to .40-caliber using nothing but household tape and American Exceptionalism. Why have a firing chamber? Why have a barrel? Let's cut out the middle man! Sure, it sounds stupid and you'll end up wounding yourself, but let's face it, put a suit on that guy and let his stupid idea cost jobs instead of bandages, and he'd be in line for a fat bonus.
Now, without further ado, the week's dishonor roll, below the fold.



WACO, TX, 3/18/13: Police responding to a domestic disturbance call found a man struggling to restrain his grandson, who was agitated and holding an AR-15. The cops shot grandpa. But that would totally never happen in a crowded theater.
GROSSE POINTE PARK, MI, 4/06/13: Grosse Pointe Park police arrested a 20-year-old Detroit man April 6 after he accidentally shot a 9mm handgun into the floor of a home in the 1000 block of Beaconsfield. The man was trying to make the gun safe when it discharged.
OTTAWA, KS, 4/13/13: No one was injured when a “negligent” rifle shot rang out Saturday night inside a residence in the 1600 block of South Cedar Street in Ottawa. Dylan Spencer, 22, Ottawa, was arrested by Ottawa police about 7 PM on suspicion of unlawfully discharging an AR-15 rifle in his apartment, according to a police report. The bullet exited his apartment, passed through both walls of an occupied apartment and lodged into a utility pole. But of course, Dylan didn't think the gun was loaded. So it's cool.
KLAMATH FALLS, OR, 4/13/13: An investigation into the shooting death of Lee Roy Myers, 47, has been ruled accidental. The Klamath County Major Crimes Team was called to investigate a shooting on Saturday, April 13. An autopsy concluded the cause of death was an accidental, self-inflicted handgun wound.
SOUTHAMPTON, NY, 4/13/13: The report states that the detective visited the home and interviewed the man, who legally owned the Ruger 10/22 rifle. The man said he was cleaning the rifle when it accidentally discharged into his big toe. When the rifle was pointed in a downward angle, inertia caused the firing pin to strike the primer, which caused the rifle to fire, according to the incident report. The detective advised the man on safety techniques while cleaning his rifle. (Step one: unload it.)
CONROE, TX, 4/14/13: Conroe police officers arrested a 33-year-old man after his 3-year-old son fired a 9mm handgun in their apartment April 14 at the Carriage Woods Apartments, located at 1515 Wilson Road. The bullet lodged in the ceiling of the apartment, and the child suffered a minor injury on his face from the gun’s recoil.
ALEXANDRIA, VA, 4/15/13: Alexandria police report that a man staying in a hotel room in the city’s West End accidentally discharged a firearm. The incident occurred at 11:55 PM April 15 in the 5000 block of Seminary Road. The only hotel in the area is the Hilton Alexandria Mark Center Hotel. The firearm was legal, according to police reports. No injuries were reported.
NEW YORK, NY, 4/15/13: A North Carolina man visiting the Sept. 11 memorial and discovering that firearms were not permitted, hastily stashed his gun (legally owned, though not permitted for New York) in the cushions of a seat in the lobby of a World Trade Center-area hotel. And left it there. The timing wasn't great, either. Apparently, it happened just minutes before the Boston Marathon bombing, so when it was found shortly thereafter, it set off a full-blown security panic. Returning later and finding the gun missing, he did not report it to police. Seems he thought ""whoever found it, they would contact him and want a reward,” a relative told police. How they'd find him remains a mystery, but we'll count that as one vote in favor of a national registry of firearms owners. One other note: this is the second Carolinian to leave a gun behind in a New York hotel this month.
NASHVILLE, TN, 4/15/13: Christ Presbyterian Academy student Coleman Spann was arrested and charged with possessing firearms on school property Monday. According to a police affidavit, a witness received a report of Spann having alcohol in a cooler in his vehicle. Spann consented to a search of his vehicle, during which an unloaded shotgun, an unloaded AR-15 rifle and several boxes of shotgun ammunition were discovered, according to the affidavit. Spann, 18, was arrested around 4:25 PM on Monday and charged with carrying a weapon on school property with the intent to go armed. He was released after posting a $3,000 bond.
BOGART, GA, 4/16/13:A 36-year-old Oconee County man was treated at St. Mary's Hospital last Tuesday evening, April 16, after apparently accidentally shooting himself in the leg. The man told the deputy who had responded to the hospital around 7:30 PM that as he was removing a .22 revolver from the front pocket of his pants to place on a shelf in the living room of his home, the weapon discharged once.  The man was struck in the left leg below the calf muscle, according to the deputy's report.  The path of the bullet was visible, just under the skin, the deputy wrote, and the bullet lodged in the shin bone.
NORMAN, OK, 4/16/13: A man attempting to ""make his gun safe"" inside his vehicle instead ""made it shoot him through the thigh.""
MONROE, LA, 4/17/13: Investigators with Monroe police said a Wednesday afternoon shooting near the campus of the University of Louisiana at Monroe was accidental. “When our patrol officers arrived, they found a 16-year-old victim on the scene who had been shot in the (right) leg,” Brown said. He said the victim was taken to an area hospital where she was listed in stable condition. Brown said officers also arrested a 16-year-old male who was believed to be responsible.
VALLEJO, CA, 4/17/13: Tee-Ball rage! The North Vallejo Little League season has been canceled indefinitely after shots were fired at a game this week. The sounds of baseball were silenced after a parent fired shots into the vehicle of a parent from the opposing team on Wednesday.
WATKINSVILLE, GA, 4/19/13: Oconee County's (pop. 33,366) second negligent shooting in three days. A 25-year-old Watkinsville man shot himself in the hand when he tried to disassemble a pistol with a live round, deputies said. Both incidents were investigated by Oconee deputies, who determined no foul play was involved in either case, Sheriff Scott Berry said Monday. Both men simply were careless in their handling of loaded weapons, said Berry, who called the shootings “negligent discharges.” The Watkinsville man told deputies he had cleaned his Glock pistol, reassembled it, loaded a magazine, and chambered a live round, when his friend asked to look at the barrel. The man “placed his left hand over the end of the barrel of the hand gun, squeezed the trigger which is required for disassembly, and the live round went off,” according to a deputy’s report, striking the man in the left hand.
POMPANO BEACH, FL, 4/19/13: A man who police said accidentally shot and killed his friend in Pompano Beach, faced a judge Thursday. Twenty-year-old Adiel Jaramillo was charged with one count of manslaughter. Investigators said he was drunk and waving his gun around at the victim's apartment, located along Southwest Fourth Avenue and Second place last Friday. Police said that's when he accidentally fired the weapon, killing 19-year-old Michael Cornelio.
MYAKKA CITY, FL, 4/20/13: Floyd K. Oney II was invited by Jason C. Durrance to go hunting at his property at 37550 Clay Gully Road. Oney had a single action .45 revolver in a belt holster, slung over his shoulder. Shortly before 7 PM, the men had trouble starting the Kawasaki Mule they were intending to use, and when they raised the seat and leaned over the vehicle, the revolver fell from Oney's holster and discharged when it hit the ground, deputies said. The round entered and exited through the left side of Oney's abdomen.

He was fishing about 100 yards away from a gun class at the Whitesboro Rodeo Grounds around 2 PM on Saturday, Sheriff's Office Lt. Rickey Wheeler said. Deputies say the CHL class teacher is not state-certified and there was no berm or backstop to absorb the bullets. The bullet went through the man's body, missing his heart by a few inches. Instructor Ramsey tells News 12 he received certification from a 2-day NRA program back in March and has been teaching classes in Bridgeport and Whitesboro, but Lt. Wheeler says CHL instructors in Texas have to be certified by the state.
ASHBURN, VA, 4/20/13: A 33-year-old Leesburg man suffered non life-threatening injuries April 20 after his firearm accidentally discharged while he was trying to store it. The incident occurred about noon in the 43600 block of Greenway Corporate Drive in Ashburn.
GARDNERVILLE, NV, 4/20/13: During a domestic disturbance, a woman's brother drew his gun to protect himself and his sister from her husband. In the ensuing fight, though, he ended up gut-shooting his sister. Guns make us safer ... until they don't! Still, I'm sure it's the thought that counts.
LIVERMORE, KY, 4/20/13: The McLean County Sheriff's Department says a Owensboro man who was killed in Livermore Saturday morning died of what investigators believe was a self-inflicted accidental shooting. Micah Lee Griffith, 21, of Owensboro died of a gunshot wound to the head. A sheriff's department press release says deputies were called to a Livermore home at 4:50 AM Saturday. Witnesses told deputies Griffith was playing with a handgun when he put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, the press release says.

ANNISTON, AL, 4/21/13: Look with your eyes, not with your ... calf. Hmm. Anniston police Sgt. Chris Sparks said the 21-year-old man was in a car on the 3000 block of Gurnee Avenue Sunday at 1:30 PM looking at a handgun. While the man was sitting in the car, the gun accidentally went off and shot him in the calf, Sparks said.
MIAMI, FL, 4/21/13: A woman on her way to the shooting range was accidentally shot in the face.
BROWN CO., TX, 4/21/13: Another Patriot has shared a Liberty Projectile with a neighbor, and is greeted as a liberator! According to the report, the reporting party stated that he had just installed a new scope on his rifle and was looking out the window from his bedroom when he accidentally fired the weapon toward a neighbor’s residence. The owner/victim of the damaged residence advised his home was hit by the projectile but declined to press charges and made an agreement with the calling party regarding the repair of the residence, the report states.
CARTERSVILLE, GA, 4/21/13: On Sunday at 9 PM, a Bartow County Sheriff’s Office deputy was dispatched to Cartersville Medical Center to investigate an accidental discharge of a firearm. On arrival, the officer learned that the victim was a nurse at the medical center. The victim said he was cleaning his .38 caliber Derringer before going outside to shoot the gun. The victim said he failed to secure the bottom of the pistol causing the barrel to flip up when the pistol was fired. The bullet struck the victim in the middle finger of his left hand and exited through the palm. No charges were filed.
SPARKMAN, AR, 4/21/13: Responsible Gun OwnerTM shoots a hunting buddy in the leg trying to pull a .40 caliber handgun out from between two seats in the truck. Sure, he'd been drinking, but it's not actually against the law to be drunk and play with your guns in Arkansas, which is why it would have been awesome for Arkansans to help out up in Boston last week with their AR-15s. Anyhoo, the buddy who got shot in the leg died, which I'm sure didn't happen because people were too drunk to remember to put a tourniquet on him. Plus, the prosecutor, ""says he's convinced the death was accidental."" Good enough for Arkansas.
KANSAS CITY, MO, 4/21/13: Davis, Montee and several others were at a town home in the 11500 block of Food Lane when Montee was accidentally shot by a younger boy. They dragged his body to the basement so the mother at the home would not see it. They put a comforter over Montee’s body while they cleaned up the blood. Update: Prosecutors say Montee's 12-year-old brother did the shooting.

GAINESVILLE, FL, 4/25/13: So, let's say you're a convicted felon who's prohibited by law from having a gun, but you've also got a compelling need to shoot a squirrel. What do you do? Well, you could get a BB gun, right? And so this fellow did. But what if you also have some compelling need to shoot that squirrel with .40-caliber ammunition? What do you do then? Well, how about taping a .40-cal. cartridge to the gun, and striking the primer with the BB pellet? Won't that work? Sure it will! If you don't mind having the cartridge explode, fragment, and hit you with the shrapnel, that is! Oh, and we probably should have mentioned that it's also illegal for you to have the ammunition. That might've helped short circuit this whole idiotic episode. But then again, criminals don't follow laws (except for the one about the gun, which he did, but forget about that), so screw it.

This, apparently, is Mr. Weatherford's definition of The Golden Rule



This, apparently, is Mr. Weatherford's definition of The Golden Rule

Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford is a rising star in conservative political circles. Yesterday, the 33-year-old Republican appeared to burnish those credentials, receiving a standing ovation after delivering a passionate speech decrying Gov. Rick Scott's decision to take advantage of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. The Palm Beach Post reports.
In the morning speech explaining his resistance to expanding health coverage for the poor, Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel, told the House and Senate, meeting in a joint session on the Legislature’s opening day, about his family’s circumstances when he was 15 and his brother, Peter, age 2, died of cancer after surgeries and a year’s worth of treatment had drained the family’s savings.
His father, who was self-employed, and his mother, who home-schooled the family’s nine children, faced a “mountain of medical bills,” Weatherford, 33, said. The family was uninsured.
“It was the safety net that picked my family up,” Weatherford said. “I will continue to believe in – and fight for – a strong safety net for Florida.”
Hours after his speech, when asked to expand on his story, Weatherford told reporters that his family didn’t receive Medicaid.

Weatherford initially said he didn't know precisely who paid for the care, but later in the day a staffer soon told The Palm Beach Post that the cost had been written off by medical professionals as charity care. That story supported the premise of Weatherford's argument: Instead of expanding money pits like Medicaid, Florida should fight for the safety net that helped his family when it was in need.
As you'll see below the fold, the only problem with the story is that it wasn't true.


Despite his initial denials and claims of having received charity care, it turns out that Weatherford's family did in fact receive support from Medicaid:
Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford reversed course on Wednesday and said that health care provided for his brother was covered under Florida's Medically Needy program, which is financed by Medicaid.
When Will Weatherford said he would stand up and fight for the safety net that helped his family, but not for Medicaid, it was an emotional triumph. But it was also complete bullshit, because Medicaid is the safety net that helped his family, and Will Weatherford isn't fighting for Medicaid—he's fighting against it.

Abuse of power. What else can we call the actions Republicans have taken in their drive to sabotage Obamacare? And let's be clear, sabotaging Obamacare means keeping as many people as possible uninsured. The Republicans intend—to paraphrase a quotation from the Vietnam War—to destroy this village in order to save it. The White House has options, however, if it is willing to contemplate them. But that means taking the advice Chicago beat cop Jimmy Malone gave to federal Treasury officer Eliot Ness in The Untouchables (see above), as it applies (non-violently of course) to the political arena. In other words, it's time to go nuclear.
Let's step back for a minute and examine just what Republicans have been doing. We can start with the lies. The claims that Obamacare will drive up premiums were recently debunked by a new Kaiser study, which found they are coming in even lower than expected. We do have to remember of course that reality has a well known liberal bias. In any case, the Grand Ole' Party doesn't stop at lying. That's kid stuff.
Republicans have obstructed Obamacare at the state level wherever they've been able to. In one of the most egregious examples, we have Georgia State Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens, who bragged about his own efforts:
""Let me tell you what we're doing [about Obamacare.] Everything in our power to be an obstructionist.""
""We have passed a law that says that a navigator, which is a position in that exchange, has to be licensed by our Department of Insurance. The ObamaCare law says that we cannot require them to be an insurance agent, so we said fine, we'll just require them to be a licensed navigator. So we're going to make up the test, and basically you take the insurance agent test, you erase the name, you write 'navigator test' on it.""

And it's not just Georgia. Follow me beyond the fold for more abuses as well as my proposal for how the White House can checkmate at least the ones emanating from Congress.



A whole gaggle of Republican-controlled states are coming up with all kinds of ways to sabotage Obamacare's rollout. There is no doubt whatsoever about what Republicans, personified by Ralph Hudgens, are doing here. They are using and abusing the powers they possess in order to sabotage this law.
We can compare their behavior to that of Democrats after the passage of Medicare Part D—championed by George W. Bush. Democrats, although most of them opposed the law, engaged in no such attempts to sabotage its rollout. They fought on the floor of the House and Senate, but once they lost, they accepted that the law is the law in a democracy. But that's not how Republicans operate.
Perhaps the most egregious and potentially effective measure in the effort to obstruct Obamacare comes out of the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week submitted a request for a huge amount of irrelevant information from navigators—the people whose job it is to guide and educate citizens about how Obamacare can work for them. The fact that Republicans at the state and federal level have focused on throwing up roadblocks in the way of the navigators shows just how important they will be to the success of Obamacare.
The request from the Energy and Commerce Committee came in less than a month before the new Obamacare health insurance exchanges go live on Oct. 1, and serves no purpose other than to drain time, energy and resources away from navigators in the run-up to that date. Of course, the Committee has largely targeted states where the highest percentage of the population lacks insurance. In case you were wondering, yes, Texas is the worst offender. Go conservatism!
Law professor and health reform advocate Timothy Jost had this to say about the House's efforts:
Look at item 6 and the accompanying sheet defining documents subject to the request. This could include hundreds of documents and emails and could take days to locate and compile. It might have been reasonable to ask them to describe what they do and how they intend to do it. This is a much more intrusive and extensive request. It is also important to note that most of these organizations are doing this on a comparative shoestring, and this is the busiest time in their existence. They just got their grants, they are concluding cooperative agreements with HHS, they are hiring, training their employees, getting them certified, setting up security systems, making contacts, and even to have to take a day off to respond to this is too much. And the committee knows this. This is not about gathering information. It is about trying to stop a program. (Emphasis mine)
The time has come to put a stop to these kinds of actions. The Republicans have taken a power that is designed to be applied reasonably and judiciously, namely Congress' authority to oversee the executive branch, and abused it beyond recognition. They have twisted that authority into an instrument to defy democracy, to render null the laws passed by the people's elected representatives.
This abuse cannot be allowed to stand. It is a perversion of democracy. The time has come to fight back. What can we do about it? If I were the president, I'd want to do whatever was in my power to fight back. And here's my idea:
Yes, Congress has the power to issue these demands for information. There is no limit on their oversight power, other than that they cannot violate a citizen's civil liberties. In fact, if the navigators do not comply, they can be held in contempt of Congress, a federal charge. Fine. But the President can checkmate this move with one of his own.
The Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, describes the President's power to pardon, according to which he or she:
shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.
There is no other limit on that power. The president can issue a pardon as soon as a crime has been committed, there is no need to wait for any charges to be brought.
President Obama should announce that:
1) The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee to the Obamacare navigators is nothing more than a blatant attempt to prevent Americans from obtaining health insurance.
2) The request is part of a broader Republican scheme to sabotage Obamacare -- which is the law of the land.
3) The request is an abuse of power, plain and simple. Our government cannot function properly if one side is allowed to abuse its power in order to prevent duly enacted laws from functioning properly.

The president should declare that, for these reasons, he authorizes all the targeted parties to ignore the request from the House of Representatives. Furthermore, he will issue immediate, full, and complete pardons to anyone that the House attempts to prosecute for ignoring their request, or any other similar requests that the President deems equally abusive and designed to sabotage duly passed laws.
This would be a serious step, and it is not one I advocate lightly. Of course, Barack Obama wouldn't the first president to try and get around a congressional subpoena. We are talking about something different here, however, than what George W. Bush did. Congressional oversight is about checks and balances, making sure that no branch of government gains too much power. The request from the House Energy and Commerce Committee is part of an attempt by one party to undo legislation even though it lacks the votes to do so. If they succeed, there will be no point to even having elections. What I have proposed is a defensive measure, one that fights fire with fire rather than something designed to cover up misdeeds.
When one side keeps punching below the belt, the other side eventually has no choice but to do whatever it can to defend itself. In this case, the White House would be defending its signature law, which really means defending the people who wouldn't be able to get health insurance without it. Furthermore, the president would be defending democracy against an opponent that has shown time and again that it does not care how it obtains power.
The Marquess of Queensbury and his rules ain't welcome at this contest. It's a street fight. It's time for the White House to get ugly. Long past time.
The question for President Obama is the same one the Chicago beat cop put to the G-Man in The Untouchables:
What are you prepared to do?

660,http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/12/10/1261631/-The-REAL-reason-Republicans-hate-healthcare-gov,Opinion,Dailykos,Democrat,*UPDATED* Take Action! The REAL reason Republicans hate healthcare.gov,"

Last night, I applied for insurance on healthcare.gov. I'm one of those so-called ""uninsurables"" - insurance companies declined to cover me because I have... allergies (way!). So, while I was gratified to have completed the enrollment process, I believe I stumbled across the real reason Republicans have been trying to scare the public away from the ACA website.
Join me over the orange caduceus to see what I discovered.


Oh sure, there are plenty of stories circulating now - like Joan's FP post today - about people finally being able to get quality, affordable health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. But that's only half the story.
After I was successfully enrolled (which by the way only took half an hour for myself, my wife, and my three offspring), I was almost instantly given the news that I qualify for coverage! Yay! followed by a page of other news about the new law. I've been keenly interested so I was already aware of most of that information.
The one exceptional item - the thing that I am convinced has Republicans foaming at the mouth - was buried at the end of that page.
Here's an actual screenshot from my session:

Do you see it? Do you understand why the Republicans have been so anxious to ""kill the bill?"" Pronouncing the website a train wreck, trying to keep people away?
Here, let me make it a little easier to see:

Still can't see it? Let me zoom in real close:

Right there, on that page, is everything the Republicans hate: a program designed to help people of modest means, run by the government - AND giving those same people an opportunity to exercise their franchise.
If there really was a left-wing conspiracy funded by George Soros, I'd put in an expense request to get the list of people who had created an account on healthcare.gov, and around October 1, 2014 I'd mail them each a postcard with a very simple message:
You know that health plan that you signed up for last year? Democrats made that happen. Not a single Republican voted for it. In fact Republicans did everything they could to keep it from happening. Remember that when you vote.
Demonstrating that government works (when the right people are in charge) - and then telling the people that same government just helped that they can do something to keep government working? No wonder the Republicans are in a frenzy.
UPDATE 1:51pm EST (scoop won't let me use the update feature)
Reclist? thanks everyone! (first time)
As a follow-up - as noted in the comments, just because people can register to vote does not necessarily mean they will exercise that right - either by habit, or because of obstacles Republicans are trying to put in the way. In either case, the answer is the same: stay engaged. Don't agonize, organize!
UPDATE 2 10:00am 11-Dec-2013 (scoop apparently doesn't like my Chrome installation, either)
First, let me apologize for leaving out the VA/Tricare option from the poll. ""Tricare for all"" would be an excellent improvement to our health care delivery system.
Several commenters noted that the ACA would be saving their families a lot of money starting next year. Others pointed out that due to the increased competition, their employer-sponsored plans were going to be MUCH cheaper, saving the company and employees thousands of dollars.
By coincidence (and I don't believe in coincidence), I got an email this morning from Families USA, an advocacy group that has been pushing for better healthcare for all Americans. They have set up a website and a Facebook campaign to make it easier to share these kinds of success stories. So if you have one to tell, please do!

Families USA ACA success story Facebook campaign

Dear Mark,
This holiday season, there's one big thing we're thankful for – that the online health care marketplaces opened, giving millions of uninsured Americans the opportunity to enroll in health coverage.
But, while we're grateful for this opportunity, we're also thinking about the millions of Americans who haven't yet signed up for coverage because they don't yet know that they qualify.
The best way to ensure that everyone who is eligible actually signs up for coverage is to spread the word and highlight stories of successful enrollment. But to do that, we need your help.
Mark, spreading the word is easy, and it makes a big difference. Simply share our Facebook post with your followers and help spread the word about the benefits of health coverage that the Affordable Care Act now provides.
Or, draft your own post and share why this issue is important to you. It might not seem like much, but the more people who share, the broader our reach, and the more people we can encourage to enroll.

There's a fabulous piece online about the Republican's relentless and dishonest assault on Obamacare, detailing and refuting all of the lies that they have been telling to counter it. The headline says it all:
""Are Republicans So Frantic to Stop Obamacare Because They Fear It Will Work?""
Read more below:


Unlike the Chuck Todds of the world, this piece is one where the reporter picks a corner, defends it and then attacks, ripping apart the GOPs deceit with skill and not a little viciousness. It was a delight to read. From the opening paragraph, the relentlessness is apparent
What is it about Obamacare that compels seemingly intelligent people to explode in bubbling spasms of stupid? Are they misinformed? Unable to see past the rage-fueled partisan sweat dripping into their eyes? Or just plain dishonest?
The piece then highlights what I have been saying for a long time about the GOP and their attacks on Obamacare: That they are going to look terrible in the future once the history is told.
At this point, it has become obvious that history will look back on the four-year war on Obamacare as one of the saddest, most bizarre, and most dishonestly embarrassing episodes of our time. I have given up trying to understand the vehement opposition of so many who cannot offer up truthful reasons for their objections, and instead fuel the hatred and fears of the uninformed with the most illogical, mendacious, and fundamentally bizarre arguments that have ever been marshaled. By comparison, Joe McCarthy’s McCarthyistic McCarthyism was an exercise in reason.
The piece then goes down the list - death panels, government takeover of health care, Washington dictating treatments and on and on and on. It goes after the lies, the conservative academics who push out purported ""independent analysis"" that is bogus, and on and on and on. Recently, conservative nut Betsy McGaughy argued that Obamacare would force doctors to ask patients about their sex lives and bemoaned the horrors of electronic medical records. The Vanity Fair piece responds:
The time may well have come to reconsider whether (McGaughy) should ever be taken seriously again. That is, if you have in the past. In fact, her new diatribe suggests either she has a really bad doctor or she needs to see a good one... know that there are plenty of social conservatives who consider sex to be something icky that should never be discussed or something immaculate that shouldn’t be enjoyable, but the reality is, good doctors ask about sex. That is not an Obamacare requirement—it is something that medical students learn in their first year when studying how to take a history and physical of a patient....This is part of what is called “social history,” and it is a critical part of any medical examination. That involves smoking history, use of alcohol, other drug use, and, yes, sex. The discussion of sexual matters is not so the doctor can run off into the next room and giggle about pee-pees. It is an essential part of any medical exam because it can be a key contributor to someone’s health.
Then, on medical records, the piece notes that the largest health care company in the world uses them, and boasts that they ""improve 'safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care."" Then the author writes:
 
Safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency? What a nightmare! Betsy, you better call (the company) right now and let them know that their system to make medical care better does not have your stamp of approval because—hell, I don’t know. You never explain a reason other than to suggest that the next Edward Snowden will leak everyone’s health-care information before fleeing to Russia.
I can't quote anymore without violating fair use, but it is a lengthy piece worth a read. Plus, it is apparently just part one. The second part about the truth of Obamacare is going to be posted next week.

Republicans just can't convince Americans of the horribleness of Obamacare it seems. At a Town Hall in Winter Haven FL, Daniel Webster was called out by his constituents for his multiple votes to repeal Obamacare.
Americans know that Obamacare offers them consumer protections against the health insurance companies that have been robbing them:

QUESTIONER: What happens to us when Obamacare is repealed? What happens to people with pre-existing conditions that can’t get health care? What happens to those of us who finally have access to health insurance for the first time in nine or ten years? What happens to us? And you want to make this local, I’ll make this local. I’m a constituent, right now I can’t get health care. I’m waiting for this [insurance marketplace] to open and I’d like to know why we keep repealing [Obamacare]?
The congressman defended his repeal votes by saying the law would drive up Americans’ health care costs by requiring insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions. He then claimed that President Barack Obama himself thinks his signature law is unworkable. As evidence, Webster implied that the law’s protections — such as its cap on consumers’ annual out-of-pocket medical costs — were being dismantled by the Obama administration. That prompted an outcry from the audience, as people booed and countered Webster’s claims.
An event official interrupted at that point, asking the audience to be respectful and give Webster a chance to speak. One audience member replied by saying, “Well, tell him to stop lying!”







When Town Halls consist of voter citizens expressing their displeasure with their Congressman's votes, and he defends them, trying to convince them that he is right and they are wrong, despite the fact that they have facts on their side, you know democracy has been coopted by lobbyists, corporations, and the Koch Brothers. Thankfully Americans are becoming informed despite the best efforts of the media at disinformation, know that Obamacare offers them benefits, and are starting to fight back and hold their representatives accountable.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) must be having a big ol' sad that he can't be in the House voting to repeal Obamacare every other week. So he's getting in on the act, and one-upping the House. He's not just willing to destroy Obamacare, he's ready to take down the whole government to kill the law.
Speaking on Fox News, Lee said Republicans determined that refusing to fund Obamacare was the ""last stop"" before the individual mandate and the law's health insurance exchanges are set to go into effect at the beginning of next year.
“Congress of course has to pass a law to continue funding government—lately we’ve been doing that through a funding mechanism called a continuing resolution,"" Lee said. ""If Republicans in both houses simply refuse to vote for any continuing resolution that contains further funding for further enforcement of Obamacare, we can stop it. We can stop the individual mandate from going into effect.”
Lee added that his effort, which he said was backed by ""13 or 14"" Senate Republicans and a host of House Republicans, wouldn't target popular Obamacare provisions that already had gone into effect, like a measure that allows children to remain on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26.

Hell, what's one more hostage? We've got the budget, we've got the debt ceiling, and now we've got the mechanism Congress has had to use to keep the federal government's lights on—the continuing resolution. It's sort of shocking that they didn't already get there: It is the surest way to finish the job they've started and to reach their ultimate goal of destroying the federal government.
All because a lot more people will now be able to get more affordable health insurance.

At this point, it has become obvious that history will look back on the four-year war on Obamacare as one of the saddest, most bizarre, and most dishonestly embarrassing episodes of our time. I have given up trying to understand the vehement opposition of so many who cannot offer up truthful reasons for their objections, and instead fuel the hatred and fears of the uninformed with the most illogical, mendacious, and fundamentally bizarre arguments that have ever been marshaled. By comparison, Joe McCarthy’s McCarthyistic McCarthyism was an exercise in reason.
The piece then goes down the list - death panels, government takeover of health care, Washington dictating treatments and on and on and on. It goes after the lies, the conservative academics who push out purported ""independent analysis"" that is bogus, and on and on and on. Recently, conservative nut Betsy McGaughy argued that Obamacare would force doctors to ask patients about their sex lives and bemoaned the horrors of electronic medical records. The Vanity Fair piece responds:
The time may well have come to reconsider whether (McGaughy) should ever be taken seriously again. That is, if you have in the past. In fact, her new diatribe suggests either she has a really bad doctor or she needs to see a good one... know that there are plenty of social conservatives who consider sex to be something icky that should never be discussed or something immaculate that shouldn’t be enjoyable, but the reality is, good doctors ask about sex. That is not an Obamacare requirement—it is something that medical students learn in their first year when studying how to take a history and physical of a patient....This is part of what is called “social history,” and it is a critical part of any medical examination. That involves smoking history, use of alcohol, other drug use, and, yes, sex. The discussion of sexual matters is not so the doctor can run off into the next room and giggle about pee-pees. It is an essential part of any medical exam because it can be a key contributor to someone’s health.
Then, on medical records, the piece notes that the largest health care company in the world uses them, and boasts that they ""improve 'safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of health care."" Then the author writes:
 
Safety, quality, effectiveness, and efficiency? What a nightmare! Betsy, you better call (the company) right now and let them know that their system to make medical care better does not have your stamp of approval because—hell, I don’t know. You never explain a reason other than to suggest that the next Edward Snowden will leak everyone’s health-care information before fleeing to Russia.
I can't quote anymore without violating fair use, but it is a lengthy piece worth a read. Plus, it is apparently just part one. The second part about the truth of Obamacare is going to be posted next week.

It is rare that a prominent public intellectual uses such blunt language. Here is how Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman summarizes Bush's legacy in a 27-Apr-2013 post on his NYT blog:
The Great Degrader
I’ve been focused on economic policy lately, so I sort of missed the big push to rehabilitate Bush’s image; also, as a premature anti-Bushist who pointed out how terrible a president he was back when everyone else was praising him as a Great Leader, I’m kind of worn out on the subject.
But it does need to be said: he was a terrible president, arguably the worst ever, and not just for the reasons many others are pointing out.

In addition to the usual list of policy catastrophes, Krugman thinks Bush infected us with an enduring malignancy:
Think about his two main “achievements”, if you want to call them that: the tax cuts and the Iraq war, both of which continue to cast long shadows over our nation’s destiny. The key thing to remember is that both were sold with lies.
... their selling of the [tax] cuts offered what amounted to an expert class in how to lie with statistics. Basically, every time the Bushies came out with a report, you knew that it was going to involve some kind of fraud, and the only question was which kind and where.
And no, this wasn’t standard practice before. Politics ain’t beanbag and all that, but the president as con man was a new character in American life.

And,
Even more important, Bush lied us into war. Let’s repeat that: he lied us into war. I know, the apologists will say that “everyone” believed Saddam had WMD, but the truth is that even the category “WMD” was a con game, lumping together chemical weapons with nukes in an illegitimate way. And any appearance of an intelligence consensus before the invasion was manufactured: dissenting voices were suppressed ...
... right there you have something that should block Bush from redemption of any kind, ever: he misled us into a war that probably killed hundreds of thousands of people, and he did it in part for political reasons.
There was a time when Americans expected their leaders to be more or less truthful. Nobody expected them to be saints, but we thought we could trust them not to lie about fundamental matters. That time is now behind us — and it was Bush who did it.

PK is not mincing words.

Stop defending traitors!!!
Idiot dimwit, stop defending the traitor Chuck hagel. First, he is a ""republican"" so you don't owe him anything. Second, there is plenty of proof that he is a soviet-style communist and possibly an iranian spy. Hagel hates the american military and he also hates jews and Israel. What do you think would happen if Hagel was given all the power? He would immediately start feeding military secrets to Iran and Hezbullah, or even Al Qaida. He would also try to get American soldiers killed in every possible way.
The safest thing to do would would be to block the hagel nominiation and them let him retire to Saudi-arabia. Ask yourself if youwould want your son to serve in a military commanded by the Ayatollah? Hagel is evil, he is a traitor and he will use his power to destroy America if givent he chnace. You would be wise to drop your support for this scumbag. Some fights you don't want to win.

Hagel has been SecDef for at least a couple of weeks now. How many secrets has he fed to Iran and Hezbollah? I bet a bunch. Maybe even Al Qaida!
Regarding the article ""Another day, another Oklahoma anti-science bill""
To believe that to question something as fact is anti-science, you are ignorant to what science is. The very essence of science was built on questioning and challenging authority and dogma.
You are wrong. You, however, will not understand how wrong before you short life is over and you are nothing, but a hating dead nothing. But you are very wrong. Allow me to enlighten you.
It would do you well to study your history before opening your mouth again. Eugenics, sir. Eugenics were hard scientific facts. To question it was to question scientific authority of the time. Research it, you might learn something.
But lets get more basic. Flip your ignorant, confined little world.
Science itself was to question the ridiculous religious law of the time. People had to question the ""authority,"" what people were taught as fact and truth, in order for there I be any ""science"" with what you feel such ignorant passion to defend.
Science does not nor will it ever need your protection, sir. You are incredibly ignorant and presumptive to think it does. But your lack of intelligence will surely keep you from responding to this email, as you lack the courage to actually debate something like this. And instead, you resort to monologues of hate, with which you will die clinging to.
I wish you a short, uncomfortable life. One of comfortable unchallengeable truths that you cling so tightly to and must defend!

Ha ha ha ha! Yeah, I miss hate mail too.

Good point -- we really should stop criticizing America's bake bone.
All of you are so very pathetic. Why do you live in America?
Liberalism -- an affliction brought about by low self-esteem and aggressive self-loathing. These poor souls attempt to mask their dark secret with phony compassion for people they deem as inferior because of the color of their skin. The appearance of compassion is all that matters to a liberal. This manifests itself in many ways, but chief among them is people must be made aware of the liberal's good deeds so their self-loathing can be abated for the moment. If no one is around, then the junkie liberal doesn't get their ""fix"" and they become angry, violent, childlike adults who
claim ""victimization"" as an excuse for anti-social behavior.

Now condense that down to bumper-sticker size, and 2014 will be in the bag for Republicans!

BECAUSE WE NEVER GOT THE INFORMATION WE ARE BLAMELESS AT THIS TIME, NOW THAT WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE WE ARE IMMORAL AND WILL BE GIVEN POWER TO ACT WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FROM GOD ALMIGHTY TO HIS CHILDREN. THIS INFORMATION/KNOWLEDGE IS FROM GOD I AM ONLY HIS PROPHET YOUR TEACHER. I TELL YOU THE GOSPEL TRUTH. WE ARE NOT MORAL HUMAN BEINGS AT THIS TIME, WITHIN OUR POWER TO ACT.

Maybe I should've stuck to nutpicking...
In any case, notice what's missing from all of these? Nothing homophobic. I wonder if my hate mail has dried up because the homophobes have thrown in the towel. If so, then I lay the blame squarely on the gay rights movement—your recent victories have been so definitive, so overwhelming, so crushing, that you have beaten the homophobes into quiet submission.
That's a problem for generating quality hate mail, but on the other hand, it's kinda nice for society. So yeah, a trade sorta worth making.

A federal case in San Francisco, filed by an Iraqi single mother and refugee now living in Jordan, alleges that President Bush and much of his administration should be tried for violating international law in the execution of the Iraq War.
However, the Obama administration's Department of Justice has moved to request that such Bush-era officials, and the former President, be shielded with immunity.
Per Inder Comar:
In court papers filed today, the United States Department of Justice requested that George W. Bush, Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz be granted procedural immunity in a case alleging that they planned and waged the Iraq War in violation of international law.
Plaintiff Sundus Shaker Saleh, an Iraqi single mother and refugee now living in Jordan, filed a complaint in March 2013 in San Francisco federal court alleging that the planning and waging of the war constituted a “crime of aggression” against Iraq, a legal theory that was used by the Nuremberg Tribunal to convict Nazi war criminals after World War II.

Saleh's suit alleges that President Bush and his administration falsified pretenses for the war, failed to get international approval, and began planning for the possibility of an invasion before 2000.
However, the Obama administration would like to shield the ex-President and his officials from such prosecution, arguing that everything done was performed within the scope of their various governmental roles.
Meanwhile, Bradley Manning – now Chelsea Manning – will be spending 35 years in prison for exposing U.S. war crimes.

A very frightened, 11 year old little girl conjured up the courage to ask her Congressman, Republican Scott DesJarlais, a question at the Murfreesboro,TN town hall meeting he was hosting on Thursday evening. Josie Melina spoke into the microphone with a quivering voice. She introduced herself to the crowd and said, ""Mr. DesJarlais, I have papers, but I have a dad who's undocumented. What can I do to have him stay with me?"" She was so scared, her question was barely audible (despite the microphone), so she had to repeat the question. Only one or two people can be heard clapping in support of this brave girl. That, in and of itself is shocking -- to think that grown-ups wouldn't support a young child in such an intimidating situation by applauding her courage...but, no. The crowd, consisting mostly of Tea Party Republicans, didn't applaud. At least, not until the Congressman gave his bully response.


After graciously thanking the young lady for her question, Congressman DesJarlais coldly replied, ""The answer still kind of remains the same, that we have laws and we need to follow those laws and that's where we're at."" The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, most assuredly crushing this already shaken child.
According to ProgressivePopulist.org:
Josie's father is currently in deportation proceedings and she is undergoing therapy to deal with the anxiety.
The whooping and cheering of this Tea Party crowd must have been devastating to Josie. I want to cry for her. I want to hold her. I want to tell her how frightened I would be if I were in her shoes. I want to square off with everyone who cheered her family's demise, and ask them, ""Have you no compassion???"". And I want her Congressman to care. But clearly he doesn't, so I want to do everything I can to help a Democrat win that seat in Congress.
As it turns out, Congressman DesJarlais is quite embattled with scandal. According to Raw Story:
Desjarlais is a former physician and anti-choice crusader who was fined $500 by the Tennessee Board of Medical Examiners after it came to light that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs with female patients. When one woman became pregnant, the staunch anti-abortion conservative pressured her into terminating the pregnancy. Another patient charged that Desjarlais prescribed narcotic painkillers to her for recreational use and frequently smoked marijuana with her.
The Nashville City Paper sheds more light on this guy's lack of moral ground:
But court transcripts released the week after last November's election revealed that he admitted under oath to eight affairs, encouraged a lover to get an abortion and used a gun to intimidate his first wife during an argument.
So, this guy is a real family values guy -- Republican Style. Turns out, even the Republicans don't want him. NBC recently reported he ranked No. 1 on a list of ""Top 10 Lawmakers Who Could Lose A Primary Next Year"", and he is being challenged by two other members of his own party. Hopefully, they will all destroy each other in a 3-way primary, especially since Derjarlais's seat could potentially go to the democrats in the next general election.
Enter State Senator Eric Stewart.

Uploaded with ImageShack.us
According to The Murfreesboro Post:
Less than a week after winning the Democratic Party primary, state Sen. Eric Stewart is pushing for his Republican opponent to participate in three debates...
...As of Tuesday afternoon, DesJarlais had not yet commented on whether he has decided to participate in the debates...

My first question for Senator Eric Stewart: How would he respond to young Josie Melina? Let's hope it would be a compassionate response. Something like what Obama might say:
""When nursing mothers are torn from their babies, when children come home from school to find their parents missing ... when all this is happening, the system just isn't working and we need to change it,"" Obama declared during his first run for president in 2008. A year ago, he told a Texas audience that deportation should target ""violent offenders and people convicted of crimes; not families, not folks who are just looking to scrape together an income.""
Which brings us back to the plight of Josie Melina and her family.
I began to search for answers for this young girl and her family. I came away from my research even more despondent for Josie than when I began. I ran across an AP article written almost exactly a year ago titled, ""Parents Deported, What Happens to US-Born Kids?"" In heart-wrenching detail it describes what can happen to these families.
Nearly 45,000 such parents were removed in the first six months of this year, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Behind the statistics are the stories: a crying baby taken from her mother's arms and handed to social workers as the mother is handcuffed and taken away, her parental rights terminated by a U.S. judge; teenage children watching as parents are dragged from the family home; immigrant parents disappearing into a maze-like detention system where they are routinely locked up hundreds of miles from their homes, separated from their families for months and denied contact with the welfare agencies deciding their children's' fate.
At least 5,100 U.S. citizen children in 22 states live in foster care, according to an estimate by the Applied Research Center, a New York-based advocacy organization, which first reported on such cases last year.
And an unknown number of those children are being put up for adoption against the wishes of their parents, who, once deported, are often helpless to fight when a U.S. judge decides that their children are better off here.

This is the easy part of the story, as this part is filled with statistics and data. The rest contains anecdotal stories that will tear your heart out. I encourage everyone to read this article, as hard as it is.
I leave you with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network's video of the entire exchange between a very brave Josie Melina, her despicable Congressman, and the horrendous Tea Party response. I'm sure this video will work wonders for the Republicans as they reach out for the Hispanic vote:

Opposition to the farm bill from Democrats was expected, given that it was loaded with immoral, draconian cuts to the nation's food stamp program. But what's being called a ""rebellion"" of 62 Republicans who voted against the bill because it didn't hurt the poor enough has thrown the House into chaos in what The New York Times editorial board calls ""a stunning defeat for Speaker John Boehner"":
Mr. Boehner was unable to win support from 62 Republicans on the party’s conservative fringe, who cast no votes because they believed the $20.5 billion cut in the food stamps program did not go deep enough. Nearly all Democrats also voted no because that draconian cut would have eliminated food assistance for nearly two million people.
It appears some Democrats, who might have voted for the House bill, were repelled by a last-minute Republican amendment that added a punitive work requirement to food stamp eligibility rules. That came on top of an offensive amendment Republicans pushed through on Wednesday to authorize states to conduct drug testing of food stamp applicants, despite studies showing they are no more likely than nonbeneficiaries to be using drugs.

Peter Fenn at U.S. News & World Report:
Really, who would like to be in John Boehner's shoes right now? His caucus is harder to deal with than a nest full of angry wasps.
George Zornick at The Nation had an interview with Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi before the vote, in which she explained why Democrats were going to vote against the bill:
Notably, Pelosi also said that if the GOP made the SNAP cuts even worse, ""all bets are off."" Shortly before the final vote, House Republicans passed ""one of the most extreme SNAP amendments to be offered in the program's history,"" that would basically pay states to cut off SNAP benefits.
The Los Angeles Times editorial board also came out strongly against the bill because of Republican attempts to hurt the poor:
""The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat,"" Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-Tenn.) said in quoting the Bible last month of the 48 million hungry Americans, mostly working families and senior citizens, who require federal help to put food on the table. That misguided principle stands at the center of a House farm bill that threatens $20.5 billion in cuts over a decade to food stamps, officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Pursuing the sacred cause of deficit reduction, Congress would sooner shrink aid to struggling families than substantially reform farm subsidies, of which Fincher, who owns a family cotton farm, is one of the largest recipients in Tennessee history.
More on the day's top stories below the fold.


Jay Bookman over at The Atlanta Journal Constitution says that the farm bill's fate is an ominous sign for future policy in the House:
Why did so many Republicans vote in defiance of their speaker on such a critical bill? Well, the legislation cut $20.5 billion from the food stamp program over the next 10 years, five times more than the cuts approved in the Senate farm bill. That provision had drawn a veto promise from President Obama and ensured strong Democratic opposition.
But you see, most of those 62 Republicans voted no because in their minds, those cuts weren't nearly deep enough. In fact, they refuse to vote in favor of the bill until the food-stamp program is taken out of the farm bill altogether, so they can more easily cut the program into confetti. That's why groups such as the Club for Growth and the Heritage Foundation were celebrating the bill's defeat as a major victory. [...]
That's interesting in its own right, but it also tells us something about the future of the immigration bill in the House. House leadership crafted a farm bill that they believed was conservative enough to pass with Republicans and a relative handful of farm-state Democrats behind it. But more than 60 Republicans still said nope, that sorry piece of RINO legislation isn't even close to conservative enough.
The result? No farm bill, a humiliated speaker, and a House of Representatives unable to perform duties that for most of our nation's history have been pretty routine. Given that performance, what are the odds that Boehner will be able to pull together a majority of the GOP caucus -- that's 118 Republicans -- plus 100 Democrats to pass a far more controversial and high-profile immigration bill?

Switching topics, Paul Krugman at The New York Times examines how the American economy has changed into one that has a major disconnect between profits and production:
[E]conomies do change over time, and sometimes in fundamental ways. So what’s really different about America in the 21st century?
The most significant answer, I’d suggest, is the growing importance of monopoly rents: profits that don’t represent returns on investment, but instead reflect the value of market dominance. Sometimes that dominance seems deserved, sometimes not; but, either way, the growing importance of rents is producing a new disconnect between profits and production and may be a factor prolonging the slump.[...]
You might suspect that this can’t be good for the broader economy, and you’d be right. If household income and hence household spending is held down because labor gets an ever-smaller share of national income, while corporations, despite soaring profits, have little incentive to invest, you have a recipe for persistently depressed demand. I don’t think this is the only reason our recovery has been so weak — weak recoveries are normal after financial crises — but it’s probably a contributory factor.

On the issue of climate change, The Los Angeles Times praises New York Mayor Bloomberg for thinking ahead and preparing society now for the effects of climate change:
These might be as sweeping as planning out sources of water for the West — including desalination plants and more recycling and required efficiency in water use — or as specific as a community identifying cooled buildings where the elderly and other fragile people can go during prolonged hot spells and providing transportation to get them there. It might also include planning for crop losses and other flood-related damage in the Northeast, where precipitation has increased 67% over the past 50 years, or building levees and drainage.
Expensive? Very. But the price of doing nothing would be far greater. And that's worth remembering when President Obama releases his expected proposal for reducing the carbon footprint, which will almost surely include new restrictions for coal-burning plants, the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Adjusting to climate change will require clear thinking and significant investment, but if the nation sticks its collective head in the sand, it will find that sand covered by rising seas.

Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), meanwhile, says President Obama should block the Keystone pipeline:
I’m a pro-pipeline senator. As a former mayor of Richmond, a city with a gas utility, I think it makes no sense to be anti-pipeline. But I oppose the Keystone XL project. Although the president’s decision is technically over whether to allow a pipeline to deliver oil from Alberta to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the real issue isn’t the pipeline. It’s the wisdom of using tar sands oil.
By most accounts, oil from tar sands is 15 to 20 percent dirtier than conventional petroleum, and the process of extracting and refining it is more difficult and resource-intensive. With so many cleaner alternatives, there is no reason to embrace the use of a dirtier fuel source.Approving the pipeline would send a clear signal to the markets to expand the development of tar sands oil. Such an expansion would hurt our nation’s work to reduce carbon emissions. We have to make energy cleaner tomorrow than it is today. That’s why the president should block Keystone.
